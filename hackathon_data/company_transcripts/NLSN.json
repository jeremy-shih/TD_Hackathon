All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial performance. Joining me on today's call is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer; and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Event (sic) [Events & Presentations] (01:05) section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations, and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, February 8, 2018.","We will be discussing non-GAAP measures during this call, for which we have provided reconciliations in the appendices of today's presentation and will be posted on our website.

Feel free to join the queue again. And if time remains, we will call on you.","And now, to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. In 2017, we made significant progress on our key initiatives in Watch and Buy, while continuing to adapt and evolve in the pace of rapidly changing environments. In 2018, we'll continue with our focus on investing in innovation to drive growth and efficiency, delivering value for our clients and shareholders.","I'll turn it over to Jamere to review the financials, and then I'll come back to provide an update on our key initiatives, which are consistent with what outlined in the Path to 2020 at our November Investor Day. We have confidence in our ability to execute on our three-year plan that will drive a faster-growing, higher-margin business. And we're excited to share our progress with you along the way.","Jamere?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Mitch. Our fourth quarter results highlight strong momentum in our Watch segment behind our growth initiatives, while our Buy segment continues to operate in a challenging market environment. On a full-year basis, the resiliency of our portfolio and the efforts of our team enabled us to deliver top line growth and margin expansion in 2017. And importantly, our investments in growth and efficiency positioned us well for 2018 and beyond.","First, let me give a few more details on our full-year 2017 performance. On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Total revenue was just under $6.6 billion, up 4.2% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in our Buy segment. The impact of foreign currency was a 40 basis points benefit in 2017. Net income was $429 million; and net income per share was $1.20, which was down $0.19 a share versus 2016.","Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion, lower restructuring charges, and our share buyback program, offset by provisional non-cash tax charge of $104 million or $0.29 a share related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (04:06). Excluding this charge, net income per share was $1.49, up 7.2%. Our results also reflect the book tax rate of 34%, which was a $0.06 benefit versus our previous guidance due to discrete tax benefits in the fourth quarter.","Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was up 3.8% constant currency, largely in line with our latest guidance. The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 2 points to our revenue growth. Our core revenue, which we define as total revenue less non-core or non-strategic assets, grew 6.2% constant currency in 2017, in line with the revenue framework we provided.","Our Watch segment grew 11.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and marketing effectiveness. The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 7 points to our Watch segment. Our Buy segment declined 3.3% constant currency, driven by the developed markets, down about 5%; and the emerging markets up nearly 9%. The Buy segment had approximately 2.5 points of drag from dispositions.","Adjusted EBITDA was just over $2 billion, up 4.3% constant currency; and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31%, up 15 basis points on a constant currency basis. Watch margins of 44.5% were down 85 basis points in 2017, but up 45 basis points, excluding Gracenote; while Buy margins were down 78 basis points constant currency. We generated free cash flow of $863 million, with free cash flow conversion of adjusted EBITDA at 42%. Our results were below our guidance framework due to working capital timing and higher CapEx to support our growth initiatives.","And finally, our free cash flow performance enabled us to invest in growth and return $614 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2017. We are committed to a free cash flow profile that enables growth and incremental shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy.","Moving to the fourth quarter, on the left side of the page, are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.8 billion, up 6.3% on a reported basis, driven by growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in Buy. In addition, foreign currency contributed 210 basis points to our revenue growth. Net income was $81 million; and net income per share was $0.23. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue and EBITDA growth and our share buyback program offset by the previously mentioned non-cash tax charge of $104 million. Excluding the provision, net income per share with $0.52, up 18.2%.","Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was up 4.2% constant currency. The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 2.5 points to our revenue growth in the quarter. Our core revenue grew 7.3% constant currency in the fourth quarter. And I'll provide more color on the segments in just a few moments.","Adjusted EBITDA was $579 million, up 3.8% constant currency; and adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.9%, down 14 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the lower revenue and margins in our Buy segment. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $350 million, down 26.5% versus an exceptionally strong fourth quarter in 2016.","Next I move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had a very strong quarter. Revenue was a record $913 million, up 14.8% constant currency. The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 8 points to our Watch revenue growth. Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 19.2% in the quarter, held by the Gracenote acquisition and continued momentum in Total Audience Measurement. Excluding Gracenote, Audience Measurement of Video and Text grew 6.5% constant currency led by strength in National TV and Digital. Digital Ad Ratings continued its momentum with a 51% increase in campaigns in the fourth quarter.","Digital Content Ratings, which now includes viewing from Hulu, Facebook, and YouTube, has given us tremendous momentum. Digital and TV Ratings and out-of-home measurement were also positive contributors to growth, as we continue to add measurement of some of the largest publishers and content providers in the industry. Audio was up 9.2% in the quarter, which as expected, offset the timing drag we experienced in the third quarter. The business grew slightly in 2017, while generating outstanding margins and strong free cash flow.","Marketing Effectiveness was up 32.9%. I want to point out that acquisitions contributed approximately 10 points to the growth rate. The remainder of the business was up 23% behind double-digit increases in the Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions, and Repucom, now branded as Nielsen Sports. On an underlying basis, the growth in momentum and Marketing Effectiveness remained strong, as we helped advertisers and content publishers to improve their return on investment in media spend and execute audience-based buying. As expected, we had nearly a 1 point drag on Watch revenue from the products in our Other Watch pocket due to product pruning.","Watch adjusted EBITDA was $415 million, up 13.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins were 45.5% down 59 basis points on a constant currency basis. Excluding a 1 point drag from Gracenote, Watch margins were up 41 basis points constant currency. Again, another great quarter and a fantastic year in Watch.","Let's move to Buy. Fourth quarter total Buy revenue was $848 million, down 5.3% on a constant currency basis. Core Buy revenue was down 2.8% constant currency. Previously announced dispositions were just over a 2 point drag to our Buy revenue growth. Our business in the developed markets was $527 million, down 6.7% on a constant currency basis behind growth in Europe and continued softness in the U.S.","Let me add a few more comments on the developed markets. As we said in November, the environment remains tough as some of our clients are cycling through significant cost cuts and lower overall spending.","We expect this trend to continue for the next few quarters, and our 2018 plans are not contemplating a snapback in spending. We are investing in initiatives that will benefit both retailers and manufacturers, and these investments will present opportunities for us in the back half of 2018 and beyond.","Our business in the emerging markets was $304 million, up nearly 5% on a constant currency basis. Overall, the underlying market environment in our emerging markets remained very strong. Our results in the quarter were below our full-year performance due primarily to disruption from natural disasters and some revenue execution issues in China that caused our growth rate to dip. These represented approximately a 2 point drag on our 4Q results.","Excluding these dynamics, we saw broad based growth in the emerging markets with double digits in Latin America, our second largest emerging market, and Africa, our fastest-growing emerging market.","We also saw high-single-digit growth in Eastern Europe, and we have good momentum heading into 2018. Importantly, we continue to see solid growth from both local clients and multinationals across the markets where we operate.","Emerging market revenue grew nearly 9% in 2017, in line with our expectations, and we expect the emerging markets to represent nearly 40% of our Buy business in 2018.","Buy EBITDA was $171 million, down 14.1% constant currency in the fourth quarter. We are investing in our Connected System, reshaping the portfolio, and restructuring the segment to improve growth and profitability.","Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes.","In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 210 basis points lift on revenue and 190 basis points lift on EBITDA. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through 2018, then we expect a 230 basis points lift on revenue and 110 basis points lift on EBITDA for the full year.","Moving to 2018 guidance. We are maintaining our 2018 guidance, highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3%; $1.40 to $1.46 a share GAAP EPS; and approximately $800 million of free cash flow. There's no change to the revenue framework we provided at the Investor Day in November. Our 2018 EPS guidance does not yet reflect the impact of U.S. tax reform.","And let me say a few words about the impact of U.S. tax reform on Nielsen. We anticipate that the legislation will result in a 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 32% to 34%. The 2018 tax rate is driven by a lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, partially offset by the changes to certain business exclusions, deductions, credits, and international tax provisions, and is subject to change based on our interpretations of the tax laws, along with subsequent regulations, interpretations, and guidance.","In 2018, we expect to reinvest a portion of these benefits in key initiatives to drive future growth and profitability. We will provide an update on 2018 guidance and tax benefits by next quarter. Over time, we expect the lower U.S. tax rate to boost Nielsen's GAAP EPS earnings and cash flow.","So to wrap up, our Watch business continues to have great momentum, and we'll continue to take steps to improve top line results and margins in Buy. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure that enabled us to grow and return $614 million in cash back to shareholders in 2017 in the form of dividends and buybacks.","And with that I'll turn it back to Mitch to provide additional color on the fourth quarter and the year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Jamere. I'll start with Watch. 2017 was a fantastic year. Ongoing media fragmentation continues to heighten the need for independent, comparable, and deduplicative measurement across all platforms. Our Total Audience Measurement system solves for that, providing enhanced capability, scale, and flexibility. Total Audience is the foundation for our future in Watch, and our investments in innovation position us incredibly well.","Let's revisit the three key Watch messages we shared on Investor Day. First, we're expanding the viewing captured by the C3\/C7 currency. Second, we're well on our way to becoming the currency for digital viewing. And third, we're continuing to invest in key growth areas, like subscription video-on-demand, audience-based buying, targeting, and ROI measurement. Let me provide an update on each of these.","First, expanding the C3\/C7 currency. As you know, we've already enabled clients to incorporate additional viewing into the currency through our out-of-home and Digital in TV Ratings measurement solutions. Our next step is to enable both linear and dynamic ad insertion in the same program with our C3\/C7 metric capturing the linear ad exposures and our Digital Ad Ratings metric capturing the dynamic ads.","This is important for Nielsen, but it's even more important for the industry, because it gives our clients more flexibility, and that unlocks value. We're uniquely positioned to do this because of the flexibility we've designed into our Total Audience Measurement system from the start. We look forward to helping our clients take greater advantage of this as the year progresses.","The second key Watch message is that we're on track to become the currency for digital viewing. Our ability to provide duration-weighted impressions through Digital Ad Ratings is one key factor in helping us achieve this objective, because it increases the comparability of digital video ads to TV ads.","We'll build on that by adding our own measurements of viewability and fraud into Digital Ad Ratings by the end of the second quarter, on track with our original plan.","All three of these enhancements are important for our clients, and they position as well to be the currency for all digital video.","Meanwhile, adoption continues to grow among key digital players. For instance, Vevo, one of YouTube's biggest content partners, is now using Digital Ad Ratings to guarantee digital reach, supporting their shift toward a TV-style advertising model.","In January, we expanded our coverage of YouTube in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France to include viewing via mobile apps in addition to our measurement of YouTube via desktop and mobile web browsers.","On Digital Content Ratings, we've seen great momentum among both TV and digital publishers. Our ability to include viewing from Hulu, Facebook, and YouTube was positively received by the industry. Content owners are excited they can now better demonstrate the reach of their audience across these three major digital platforms.","Finally, the third key message from Investor Day relates to our investments in our new growth opportunities in Watch. We're doing this through internal R&D, acquisitions, our innovation incubator in Israel, and new partnerships. One great example is our improved measurement and syndicated reporting of subscription video on demand viewing, which is driving incremental growth for Nielsen. Using our proprietary technology, we can now measure non-ad-supported content, capturing what used to be a big blind spot for the industry. Adoption continues to grow with Turner being the latest major client to sign on.","Audience-based buying represents another important growth opportunity. And with the upfronts approaching, this is sure to be a hot topic again this year. We're ready for it. We've long been a leader in advanced audience segments. We added to our capabilities recently with the launch of our advanced audience API, which supports planning and posting for these segments, powering systems such as clypd and OpenAP. Most of the linear market continues to trade based primarily on age and gender, but as more of the market looks to build on age and gender with these advanced audience segments, we're in a leadership position. In fact, it's Nielsen's data that's being used in the vast majority of OpenAP deals.","Gracenote is also fueling growth. Gracenote's performed incredibly well over the last year on a standalone basis, exceeding expectations on all key metrics. We're also leveraging Gracenote assets across almost all aspects of our Watch business. Our latest news is that the Nielsen Marketing Cloud is using Gracenote's Smart TV viewership data to create the industry's first person-level TV data management platform for better audience targeting and more accurate ROI measurement. This brings the industry one step closer to standardizing audience segments across linear TV, advanced TV, and digital, making all of this inventory more valuable.","This capability is powered by our artificial intelligence technologies, which were recently recognized by R&D Magazine's R&D 100 Awards, considered one of the most prestigious innovation awards in research and development. This is a big honor for our team, and I want to acknowledge their incredible work on behalf of our clients. It's another great addition to our suite of marketing effectiveness products. And as you know, this is the part of our business where we bring our Watch and Buy assets together to drive better targeting and ROI measurement for our clients. This continues to be one of the faster-growing parts of our business, up more than 20% in 2017.","On another front, earlier this week, we announced the launch of a new product called Nielsen Branded Integration Intel, which provides standardized measurement of brands appearing within video content, including TV programs. This enables our clients to compare the value of this type of brand exposure to traditional TV advertising. Integration of brands into video content is growing in importance. This includes content viewed on subscription video-on-demand platforms. Our new measurement capability helps advertisers with their spending decisions, and it helps networks and publishers drive revenue. YouTube is already leveraging our solution to help their content creators better understand the value of brand integrations. Several major networks have also signed on.","Turning to local TV, we're pleased that we've renewed our contracts with Sinclair and Tribune. Also, in local, Comcast joined existing partners, DISH, Charter, and AT&T in sharing their set-top box data for use in our local TV measurement platform. In total, we now have access to more than 25 million households, providing return path data. Combining that with the robust person-level electronic measurement data that we'll have across all 210 local markets by mid-2018 will enable us to provide clients with granular currency quality measurement, measurement that's truly representative across all segments of the population, which is a distinct competitive advantage. Finally, in Audio, we renewed our contracts with iHeart and Cumulus; and internationally, we won the audio measurement contract in Norway, covering both terrestrial and digital.","To sum up the overall picture for our Watch business, we had a great year. The flexibility we built into our Total Audience Measurement system positions us well for the future, enabling us to evolve in sync with our clients, and our ongoing investments in innovation continue to drive growth opportunities for our business","Turning to Buy, segment revenues declined approximately 3% on a constant currency basis for the full-year 2017. Emerging markets performed well with revenues up almost 9% constant currency despite the fourth quarter that Jamere addressed. We remain confident in the growth outlook for our business in emerging markets. We're well-positioned with our balanced portfolio of local and multinational clients, our investments in coverage and our global footprint.","In developed markets, the operating environment in U.S. remained tough. Many of our large fast-moving consumer goods clients continue to hold back on their spending as a result of their own top line challenges. While we're not expecting a bounce-back in spending in the near-term, we're working to ensure that when our clients do invest in new products or their existing brands to revitalize top line growth, our measurement and analytics will be uniquely well-positioned to help them.","Our focus is on our key initiatives to drive growth and efficiency despite the environment. I'll highlight three of these, the Connected System, Total Consumer Measurement, and our stronger partnerships with retailers, especially Walmart. First, the Connected System, our open platform connects our core Watch and Buy measurement data, client data, and third-party data with apps designed for decision makers all across our clients' organizations, including marketing, sales, and finance. By integrating our measurement and analytics into one system, we can drive speed and efficiency for our clients, which is exactly what they need.","We continue to make good progress on the rollout of the end-to-end Connected System, hitting our target of engaging with it, with 25 retailer and manufacturer clients by the end of 2017. We'll expand this out to approximately 100 clients in 2018. The Connected System is already making a valuable and direct contribution to our client renewal discussions in competitive takeaways. And the most visible example of this is our Tyson win, which we announced at Investor Day.","Our Connected Partner Program continues to grow. We now have 43 Connected Partners, up from 36 last quarter. We launched Media Budget Explorer, a media optimization tool for brand managers, adding to our portfolio of Nielsen Everyday Analytics apps. Our growing app portfolio has enabled us to further penetrate existing clients and also gain new clients. In total, we now have 170 clients using at least one component of the Connected System up from 152 last quarter.","The second key initiative is Total Consumer Measurement, and we've made good progress here as well. With Total Consumer Measurement, we aim to accurately and comprehensively cover all the channels that matter to our clients. One of these of course is e-commerce, and we continue to build out our capabilities globally. As of year-end 2017, we were in 17 countries.","Similar to Total Audience, a large part of our success with Total Consumer Measurement has been driven by our open collaborative approach that leverages partnerships and new sources of data. One such example that we're investing in involves capturing data directly from consumers via images of their purchase receipts. This will improve our coverage of both brick and mortar and e-commerce outlets, even if the retailer isn't a data cooperator. This investment in our core measurement data is a perfect complement to the Connected System.","Finally, our transformative win with Walmart. In November, we dramatically expanded our relationship with Walmart, having been selected as the sole data provider for their new supplier collaboration program, which they call the Walmart One Version of Truth. We launched the program on time on February 1 and have already begun signing up manufacturers, including Unilever. We've only just begun to see the positive impact of this relationship, and we're excited to see it grow.","To sum up on Buy, emerging markets had a strong year, and we've remained well-positioned. In developed Buy, while the market environment in U.S. continues to be challenging, we're making important progress on our key initiatives that better position us for growth despite the environment.","Before I close, I want to address our investments in efficiency, which will help reduce the company's annual cost base by $500 million and drive most of the four points of margin expansion for Nielsen through 2020. We're focused on three buckets of opportunity. The first one is automating Watch operations. Central to this is our new metering technology called the nanometer. It's already live in one international market, and testing is underway in the U.S. This improved metering technology coupled with our new remote monitoring and maintenance capability will drive efficiency leading to better quality at a lower cost.","The second one involves the consolidation of our operations into three super hubs in Poland, Mexico, and Malaysia. These super hubs are up and running and will significantly increase the number of deliverables coming out of these hubs in 2018.","Finally, for automating Buy data collection, we've included a chart today with the five specific initiatives and associated milestones. These are the same metrics that we shared at Investor Day. We met our goals for 2017, and we're on track so far in 2018. We'll continue to share these metrics with you as we advance. We have a lot of confidence in what we're doing here, because we've already proven these capabilities in market. The efficiency gains will accrue, as we expand these initiatives to more markets around the world.","To sum up, we remain fully committed to our Path to 2020 plan, and we have confidence in our ability to execute. Our strategy to invest in innovation for growth and efficiency will drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and four points of margin expansion through 2020. We have a gold mine of opportunity. And given a more favorable tax rate, we're actively evaluating opportunities to further accelerate our investments to drive incremental value for our shareholders. The faster we can grow the better.","With that, I'll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks. Carol, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. On the Buy emerging markets, I heard you that there was two points of short-term impact from China and natural disasters. But even if I had that back, it looks like it was a 7% growth quarter. And year-to-date, you're running in the 10% to 11% range. So, just any comment on what drove that? Is there any kind of onetime factors in addition to what you called out, or just what's the perspective there? Thank you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So, as I mentioned, our emerging markets grew nearly 5% in the quarter. We did see growth from both locals and multinationals. We were about $6 million to $7 million of revenue below our 4Q plan in the emerging markets, which is relatively small, but quite frankly, that impacted the our growth rate by 2 points to 3 points. The big drivers, as I mentioned, were natural disasters in places like India, and Puerto Rico, and Mexico. And while we're a global multinational, something always happens somewhere in the world. Quite frankly, this is a little bit more than normal. And then China, our largest market, was impacted by some revenue execution issues in the fourth quarter that caused our growth rate to dip. We've addressed these, and we expect the improvement in 1Q in 2018, but the underlying China market is very healthy.","What I'll say about the emerging markets overall is that the markets are healthy. We grew 9% in 2017. Volume and price growth is solid. In 2017, we saw local giants grow in mid-teens and multinationals grow in mid-singles. And I'm actually encouraged by the growth I see in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, Latin America, which is our second largest market is up double digits; Eastern Europe up high singles; and Africa, our fastest-growing market is up double digits as well. So, no change to the long-term framework. And we've addressed the issues that we talked about in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. Could you talk about the developed Buy weakness? It seems the trajectory is worse at 4Q versus 3Q. So, could you speak to whether things are worsening from an end market perspective; are they stable; and then the factors that are giving you confidence in the down 2% to 4% framework that you had laid out at Investor Day? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks. So, we said we'd be at the low end of the down 3% to 5% guidance, and we finished down 5.2% for the year. The environment is about the same as in 4Q. Our U.S. business was down mid-singles and Europe actually grew low singles. And these are two important markets for us were actually in line with our forecasts. And they make up 85% to 90% of our developed markets revenue.","The other thing that I'll mention as we go forward is that there's no change to the framework we gave in November. We've been very transparent that the environment remains challenged, and over time we expect clients to invest to drive growth, but we're not seeing that yet in the U.S. And so, our focus is on the investments that we're making in the Connected System, in coverage, in retailer programs. And these are all aligned with our clients' needs today and in the future. And they should drive growth for Nielsen even without a snapback in spending. And we'll begin to see some of those benefits coming in the second half of the year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And I just want to add that that's our focus is approaching those initiatives, Connected System, Total Consumer, and our retailer focus in a way that enables us to make progress in our business despite the environment. In other words, we're not banking on the environment to bounce back. We're designing our business for the future to drive progress on the top line and on the bottom line, despite the environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, Mitch and Jamere. What are you tracking kind of through 2018 to make sure that we get those efficiencies to margin expansion in 2019 and 2020? And do you think when you think about the 400 basis points of margin expansion that it's going to be more weighted towards 2020?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. What we're looking at are \u2013 first of all, for the automating Buy data collection initiatives, it's those metrics that we showed on the webcast, those five different initiatives that comprise that portion of our program.","We met our targets for 2017, and we're on track to meet our targets for 2018. And as I mentioned, looking at the opportunity to also accelerate our plans.","As far as the super hubs, all three of the super hubs are now up and running. And we're shifting work that exists within the local markets into those super hubs. And we'll continue to increase the percent of our total number of deliverables coming out of those super hubs over time. So that's the key metric we track. It's not just that the super hubs are up and running, but what portion of our business are they contributing to.","And then, finally, on the automation of Watch operations, it's that rollout of the nanometer. And then coupling that with our remote maintenance and monitoring capabilities, which reduce the number of visits that our field reps need to make to the panelist homes, which is a big efficiency driver.","So the more markets we can take that new metering technology to, the better. And obviously the U.S. is the big market. And we're already in the market testing that technology. We started the discussions with the MRC, which is an important gating organization. And yeah. So monitor our progress in terms of our ability to get it to the U.S., and that will unfold over time.","In terms of the weighting, yeah, you should expect the bulk of the margin improvement to occur in the back half of our three-year plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi, good morning. I'd like to turn back if I could to Connected System and Total Consumer. I guess when I step back and think about how that relates to your three-year plan and the revenue growth that you alluded to in the end of your comments, I'm just trying to see how that fits in.","I mean I can think of three ways you can sort of drive revenue or earnings. One is you can compel your current customers, your Buy customers, to spend more money with you. Or you can go out and acquire more new customers. Or on the earnings side, you can just maybe drive higher margins.","Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like some combination of those three things have to result in the growth. And can you map for me maybe how Connected System and Total Consumer relate to those ways to drive growth? Just trying to put that together to get some basis for confidence in the three-year guide? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, Todd, thanks. I think you're thinking of it exactly right. Connected System, first of all, will help with our renewals, with our existing clients. Our renewal rates are already very strong, especially with the largest global companies, 100% with the largest global firms. And our renewal rates will improve as the Connected System becomes available to more clients beyond that group.","And it also opens up a growth opportunity that heretofore wasn't really that achievable for us with what I'll call, the long tail, a lot of the smaller, more innovative companies that are emerging within the fast-moving consumer goods industry as barriers to entry in that market are falling.","And then, yeah, definitely, it'll be a margin driver, because it allows us to deliver our services to clients in a much more efficient manner.","And then finally, it'll bring more of our analytics revenues into the subscription model, which also makes them stickier and a more stable revenue stream for our business. That's the Connected System's contribution, so I think you're thinking of it exactly right.","On Total Consumer, what this does is, first of all, coverage is always the number one priority. When our clients are talking to us, they expect us to cover their purchasing.","As we extend to new channels, especially things like specialty channels, I'm talking about the value channel, where we're really strong with the dollar stores, I'm talking about specialty channels like pet or maybe fresh food, which is growing fast, as we cover new retailers that are emerging within those channels better, that drives revenue opportunity for us.","And then finally, as we continue to expand and build on our coverage of e-commerce, that's incremental for our business, both from a measurement perspective and it'll also drive analytics, because a lot of that data will come at the individual consumer level. And that's much more powerful fuel for the analytics that we provide to our clients.","So those are the ways those two initiatives and the products inside of them will translate into revenue, either revenue maintenance or revenue growth for our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Based on your conversations with clients, do we see an increase in ad spend from them as a result of tax reform? And also, if not, I guess what do you think will be the ultimate catalyst to get your clients to start increasing their ad spend again? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Toni. We've been hearing from our clients for several months now that they realize the necessity for their business to invest in their existing brands and in new products to revitalize top line growth in their business.","It seems just based on the evidence though that that's been difficult for them to turn into action. Some have. I know they are all intending to. Tax reform may provide them an additional opening, a catalyst for them to start to take more action on that front. Still a little early to see the actual evidence of it in the marketplace. You can be sure though that we'll be monitoring it closely.","And we also feel really confident about the products we have available to our clients when they do start to invest more. We have the products both on the measurement and the analytics side to help them turn that into growth for their business. Connected Partner Program apps, in particular, offer a whole new range of solutions that previously Nielsen didn't have that our clients had to turn elsewhere for, and so, we're better positioned today than we would have been just as recently as say, 12, 18 months ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to focus on free cash flow. So, I guess, it looks like you sold a lot more receivables than you did in the prior years and you still had the misses (38:24). Just hoping you could walk through what the different components were that you pointed out? I guess, just related to that, I didn't hear any comments in what tax reforms as to the cash tax rate. I was hoping, you could tell us what that was for 2017, and what it should be for 2018?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks Manav. Let me walk you through the tax reform piece of that, and how it will impact us. So, we expect tax reform to lower our book tax rate 32% to 34% versus our previous estimate of 38% to 38.5%. So, if this all fell through the EPS, the impact on our GAAP EPS would be $0.10 to $0.14 a share.","Now, naturally, you would expect roughly 8 points to 9 points of rate reduction from reform, just based on our profit mix, but given deduction limitations on things like interest, we actually have offsets that dampen the impact by 4 points to 6 points. So, while the corporate rate has dropped, the number of deductions have been reduced or eliminated. So, there are a lot of puts and takes in the estimated rate, what that means for free cash flow, and it's subject to change based upon our interpretation of the tax laws and along with any subsequent regs and interpretation of guidance that come along with that.","But what I want to be clear about is that over time, a lower U.S. rate is going to be a net benefit to Nielsen's GAAP EPS and cash flow. And in 2018, we expect to invest the portion of those tax reform benefits back in our key initiatives to drive growth and profitability, which will largely be focused on accelerating the plan that we laid out at Investor Day on our Path to 2020. And recall that plan was focused on growing revenue, returning to mid-single digits, expanding our margins by 4 points, and deploying capital to drive incremental shareholder value. We have an estimate of what those benefits look like. And as soon as some of the regs clear up, we'll have a clearer picture on free cash flow.","As it relates to our free cash flow in the year, actually, CapEx and working capital, which given our size and our geographic footprint, you always have a few moving pieces at the end of the year. Last year, we ran a little hot on cash at year-end; this year, we're a little short in a few international markets. But our guide for $800 million in 2018, which actually came down from our 2017 guide, the delta's largely the higher CapEx that we have. And as we get clear on some of the deduction limitations as it relates to free cash flow, +we'll have a clearer picture on what that means for our free cash flow going forward. I think, the key for us on tax reform is we have great momentum in some of these initiatives, and this presents a great opportunity for us with the benefit and the tax rate to actually accelerate those.","Mitch, I don't know if you want to add any more color on that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","No. I'm good. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Surinder Singh Thind - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the growth of subscription-based businesses and how that impacts your business? So, as those services become more popular, how should we think about the demand for your measurement services? So eventually Disney looks like it's going to be rolling out its own services; CBS has its Open Access; obviously the growth of Netflix and so forth. How should we think about the evolution of the Watch business in demand there?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks for the question. We have a number of products that are already seeing a lot of growth, because our clients want to see inside of the viewing that's occurring on subscription video-on-demand platforms. We launched several years ago an initial version of our measurement of subscription video-on-demand viewing. We, late last year, announced an upgrade to that leveraging our proprietary technology and also syndicated the reporting of it, so that all of the content owners and publishers who were licensing that content to those platforms have a better view of the viewing that's actually occurring on those platforms. So, our Digital Content Ratings and Total Content Ratings metrics, in particular, are really important there. And we're continuing to see really strong uptake and really strong growth with those products for that particular purpose.","One other thing that we've done most recently, I mentioned it in my prepared comment, is we've just launched a new product called Nielsen Branded Integration Intel. What this is about is it's helping advertisers, who are, in essence, trying to have their product to their brand featured inside of the program as part of the program content itself. And this is a source of revenue to the producers of those programs, and it's a source of brand exposure to those advertisers.","The problem is, there hasn't been really good standardized measurement of the value of doing that in the marketplace and the ability to compare it to spending money on just a normal TV ad. So, that's what we're bringing to the marketplace. It's just recently announced, in fact, just earlier this week. But it's because we see this growing importance in the marketplace, in particular, because of the viewing that's continuing to grow on subscription video-on-demand platforms.","So, we're relevant, because when people are licensing their content, they need to know how much it's worth to those platforms. And then brands still find a way to get their brands appearing inside of that content. And we're there to help them measure that and value it. And so, as that doing continues to grow, our business in the products that support that part of the viewing environment, that will continue to grow as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, on the Connected System, I think you've got 25 partners onboard, exiting 2017. Can you talk to, in that cohort, maybe the changes that you see \u2013 or the differences you see in terms of the numbers of users of the platform per client? Is that higher for that cohort? The revenue per client, is that higher or lower, the same for those clients, and then maybe just a percentage of those clients are actually making use of and taking advantage kind of the third-party app platform that's kind of bolt on top of that? Any color around that would be very helpful.","And then and then just going back to a prior question around taxes. I broke up a little bit here, but I think was the message there that tax reform net-net should be a benefit to \u2013 or positive to definitely GAAP EPS, but also free cash flow, whether you choose to reinvest that or not aside. I think the message was that it should be positive to free cash. So, I just want to confirm that. Thanks, guys.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Matthew. On your first question, in terms of Connected System and driving increased usage, great question. It's, in fact, a really important metric to our product team. It's something we have now way better visibility to because of the way the system is designed versus our product portfolio in the past. We have really strong metrics that show, as the Connected System is deployed inside of a client, how is usage growing. And not just the quantity of it, but the spread of it; how broadly is it being used, all the different apps and the platform itself across the client.","And yeah, the early data there show that it drives broader and greater usage, which is exactly what we wanted to achieve. We'll continue to monitor that very closely, of course, as it starts to get more deeply embedded in the clients who are engaged with the system on end-to-end connected basis. In terms of revenue per client, still too early really for us to comment on that one, but it'll be another important metric that's an easy one for us to address. But I wouldn't want to comment too far on that, because we're just still too early in the process.","Usage of third-party apps, that's the most important thing. Our Connected Partner Program will continue to grow. It went from 36 last quarter to 42, 43 this quarter. But the more important thing is not just how many Connected Partners we have and how many apps are out there, but exactly to your question, how robust is the usage of those apps? And we're really going to be focused much more on that going forward and continuing to grow the number of partners. We want those apps to be useful, because the more they are used, the more they help extract the value of our core measurement data that sits on that platform, and that's what's best for our business. And frankly, that's what's best for our clients.","Now, turning to your second question, I'll say a word, and I'm sure, Jamere will, too. In terms of the benefits from the change in the tax law, yeah, we will look to invest a portion of that back in the business. We're evaluating that right now though, and we're going to evaluate \u2013 all right, if we were to accelerate some of our already existing initiatives, things that are front and center in our Path to 2020 plan, in particular, on the Buy side of our business, which is what my first focus is, is getting our Buy business back to growth \u2013 if we were then \u2013 and to accelerate some of those initiatives, how does that translate in terms of the benefits to our margin expansion. In other words, how much faster can that margin expansion show up, and therefore, why is that the right thing for our shareholders, for us to do? And so, that's where \u2013 we're in the process of evaluating right now. And we'll update you more on our first quarter call.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And as we assess cash taxes specifically, in our $800 million guide we had assumed that cash taxes would tick up slightly, and that was based on sort of our view pre-regulations. Clearly, there are a lots of considerations, both short and long-term, going into 2018 that can impact that amount. As you might appreciate the Act is a pretty complicated piece of legislation, particularly for multinationals such as Nielsen. And as I mentioned, while the corporate rate has dropped, there are a number of deductions that have been reduced or eliminated. So, what we expect from an estimated cash tax standpoint is subject to change.","One of the big items that we're still awaiting guidance from Treasury on are a number of issues surrounding the new interest limitations, right, and that could impact us from a free cash flow standpoint. So, as we get clarity on those things, we will then line up sort of what our reinvestment profile will be, and then we'll come back to you in terms of what that will mean for our EPS, our EBITDA, and our free cash flow number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Moran (sic) [Tim Nollen] (49:05) from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, Tim Nollen here. I had a question about Marketing Effectiveness. It looks like the growth rate picked up in constant currency terms in Q4, I think. Could you just check me on that if that's true, and if so, why is that? And what I'm wondering is if this is an expanding service that is allowing you to dig deeper into advertisers with the marketing technology solution that lets them do more of their work in-house, and if the logical extension of that argument is that you are providing a technology that helps them do work in-house that maybe reduce some of their agency requirements, is this an example do you think of an important marketing technology that helps change the advertising landscape?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So, in terms of the Marketing Effectiveness performance in the quarter, excluding acquisitions, it was actually up 23%. And we saw strong double-digit increases in our Marketing Cloud, which is powered by the assets that we acquired when we acquired eXelate, Nielsen Catalina Solutions, and our Marketing Effectiveness products related to sports. What I'd say, overall, is that there's just an incredible demand out there for ROI measurement. And all the things that we're doing in Marketing Effectiveness are giving us an opportunity to help advertisers and content publishers better understand that return on investment.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. We do see this continued growth in the attribution metrics, the ROI of advertising. And we don't see that stopping anytime soon. It's still really early days in terms of the long-term development of that part of the marketplace, the new data sets that are available, the new tools, that's going to continue to grow.","And then I mentioned also, Tim, our strength in audience-based buying. We're told by our clients that a vast majority of the deals that are being done on the OpenAP platform, for example, are using Nielsen's data.","And it really is a testimony to the strength we've had in audience-based buying for now several years. We have a number of products already that are out there, and we're continuing to invest more in that direction.","Our Nielsen Marketing Cloud with this data management platform to allow person-level-focused targeting on TV content is going to be the next source of growth in the marketplace. And whether that, in some way, gets in the middle of what advertisers want to do with their agencies versus what they want to do themselves, still too early to say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. You've announced some high-profile renewals in Watch recently, so first of all, congratulations on that. And my question is to ask about how those renewals have been trending, specifically around apples-to-apples pricing, total contract dollars and contract length?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Bill. Yeah, we're pleased obviously to have those renewals with both Sinclair and with Tribune done. And as you know though, we don't usually go into any details on the specific terms of our renewals with clients.","But I can tell you what was important in both cases, and in fact across the board with our local clients as we renew our contracts, are the improvements we're making in our local measurement product, where we're bringing electronic measurement to all 210 markets in the United States by the middle of this year. We're incorporating set-top box data, which will provide more granularity and stability to the ratings. Also enables more analytics offerings to help the buying and selling process, which helps our clients drive growth in their business. All of these things are really resonating very well with our clients, including Sinclair and Tribune.","And the contract renewal process sometimes gives you an opportunity to merchandise these kinds of things more fully with your clients, and really that's the way we approached it. So, yeah, these things are playing very well with our clients. They contributed to strong renewals we had with our clients in 2017 as well. Clients like CBS local, Fox local, Entravision. And our local business put up some growth in 2017, they did a great job.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So local was up in 2017, as Mitch mentioned. And the initiatives that we have are giving us traction. And it's actually helping us in these contract renewals. And you saw us guide for 2018 a local business that is flattish. And we feel good about that based on the renewals and the renewal pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Revenues for the Buy segment declined faster on a constant currency basis than the prior quarter, even when you account for the natural disasters in China. Can you discuss how this impacts when you expect Buy to return to positive growth? And elaborate on what you're hearing from clients on spending intentions in developed markets?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So as I mentioned a little bit earlier, in the developed markets we were actually at the low end of the guide, which we said. We finished down 5.2% for the year.","And the other thing from our vantage point is that the environment is about the same. We expect it to be a tough environment for the next few quarters. We've seen our U.S. business be down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Europe is still growing. And these are the two important markets that are sort of in line with our forecast.","The other important point that we continue to make is while we've been transparent about the environment being challenged, over time, we do expect these clients to invest to drive growth. We're not seeing that yet in the U.S. But the investments that we're making around Connected System, expanding our coverage, retailer programs, these are all aligned with our client needs today and in the future. And they should drive some growth for us, even without a snapback in spending. And we'll start to see the benefit of that coming in the second half of this year and into next year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And that's our focus is returning our Buy business to growth, despite the environment, through the way we're approaching these initiatives, Connected System, Total Consumer Measurement, and our increased focus on retailers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. I just want to follow-up on China. Can you elaborate on what the execution issues were? I guess I wasn't clear what happened. And then you said you addressed them. So how did you address whatever issues were there?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, Tim, I was on the ground in China with our team back in December. I came away with that, from that visit, with a really clear sense that the market opportunity remains strong. We're still far from fully penetrated in that market.","Second, our market share in China continues to grow. For the full year 2017, we grew more than our global competitors. And we've outgrown our global competition fairly consistently over the past few years.","We have a very innovative team in China, but some of their recent bets that they made, they didn't pay off. And so we stumbled a bit in the fourth quarter with some execution issues.","But what I can assure you is we've addressed those. And the team's refocused on the core business. And we'll be back on track during 2018. This is still the most important growth market in the world, have no doubt about that. Our balanced client portfolio with the local clients and the global clients remains just as much of a strength today as it was before. And there's still plenty of opportunity to grow our penetration in the market, as I mentioned before.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, I was wondering about, to what degree is pricing an issue in your Buy segment? And to what degree competitive activities may be contributing to pricing or not?","And then separately, I was wondering if you could talk about how GDPR might be impacting or might impact the business in Europe in the coming year? I can imagine it might be helpful for panels. I'm curious how it might impact eXelate or Nielsen Marketing Cloud more generally. Love to hear your thoughts on both of those. Thank you.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","I'll start with GDPR. Thanks, Brian. And then I'll have Jamere address the first part of your question.","GDPR, we've been focused on this for some time. We have a big team that's working on it. We've been out in front of it. We're ready. We don't see any significant impact for our Buy business. For Watch, there'll be some things that we'll have to do to ensure our compliance with the regulations, but it's manageable. We don't expect to see any major impact on our business. We'll still have access to all the data that we're going to need for our products. So, yeah, we're in good shape.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And in terms of our Buy business and the pricing environment, very clearly, in the emerging markets, we're seeing strong volume and strong price growth, and that's having a very positive impact on our business. In the developed markets, what we're seeing is clients look to optimize spending. What we're doing is helping them determine, what's the mix of services that they need to fit their desired spend and help them grow their business.","And so, in that respect, what we're doing from a pricing and volume standpoint, it becomes a little bit more fungible in that we're trying to fit within a client's budget and make sure that they have all the measurement capability that they need and all the analytics that they need to help them grow their business within that desired budget. So, that's the way that we've been operating in the developed markets as clients have been under pressure. And it's been successful for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a question for Mr. Jackson. Maybe I'm reading or barking up the wrong tree, but your comment about potentially accelerating some of these initiatives, is that linked to the limit on interest deductibility? Are you trying to get your EBITDA, and therefore, EBIT up to a certain level to allow interest deductibility? And if that's not what may be going on, is there the scope for you to use your cash flow to actually reduce debt in absolute terms to get underneath that envelope? Thank you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So, what we're referring to is as we assess what the benefit is going to be, both from an earnings standpoint and from a free cash flow standpoint, we're looking at ways for us to go accelerate on the growth plans that Mitch talked about a little bit earlier. And so, what I'm referring to as it relates to interest deductibility, for example, is there's guidance that, I think a number of us, at least that are multinationals in this environment, are waiting on some guidance on a number of issues around the new interest limitation rules, so you can assess sort of what the impact is.","So, as we looked at taking our provision, we actually included a valuation allowance for our deferred interest expense balance. And depending on where those rigs are, we could have some additional benefits there. So, as soon as, those things become clear, we'll marry that up with our desire to go invest a little bit heavier in the things that Mitch talked about, and actually accelerate some of those initiative. So, it's about accelerating the benefits of the initiatives in and of themselves versus trying to shoehorn that into an interest deductibility equation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Hey, I just want to clarify one thing on the 2018 guidance. At the Investor Day, you gave total revenue about 3% and then total core revenue of about 4%. I didn't see the core in the most recent slide deck. Is that still about 4%, or is there any change to that?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","No. The number is still about 4%. We tried to clean up a few things on the guidance page. To be clear, we're running the company on a total company basis. We used the core nomenclature last year, as we had a number of moving parts there. What you're going to see go forward is we're not going to be moving incremental things into the corporate other bucket. And so, we thought it was a good opportunity to sunset the core language.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. And Carol with that, I think we're ready to wrap up. So, we'll turn it back to Mitch.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, just a minute to sum up. In Watch, fourth quarter was strong finish to a great year. Total Audience continues to develop incredibly well, more to come in 2018. We expanded the viewing captured by the C3\/C7 currency. We're adding flexibility with the currency, and we're enhancing Digital Ad Ratings with duration weighting, fraud and viewability metrics. Well-positioned to be the currency for digital. Marketing Effectiveness grew more than 20% in 2017. We expect continued growth from our supportive advanced audience segments and ROI measurement. Gracenote met or exceeded all of its key metrics and is adding value all across our Watch business.","In Buy, another solid year of growth in emerging markets. We remain well-positioned with our balanced client portfolio, our investments in coverage and our global footprint. For developed markets, our initiatives, including the Connected System are designed to enable our business to perform despite the challenging growth environment that our clients face, especially in the U.S. Our expanded Walmart relationship, off to a great start.","Our efficiency initiatives focused on automation and consolidation are progressing on track. We're evaluating the opportunity, as we said, to accelerate investment in some of our initiatives and the value that we could drive as a result of that. And we'll update you on our first quarter call.","I've got a bit of a cold, so appreciate all of you tolerating that. If you do, too, I feel for you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Kate Vanek","Thanks so much, Carol. Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us today to discuss Nielsen's first quarter 2016 financial performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, CEO, and Jamere Jackson, CFO. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our IR website at nielsen.com\\investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to remind you all that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, April 20, 2016.","We will be discussing non-GAAP measures during this call for which we have provided reconciliations in the appendices of today\u2019s presentation and will be posted on our website. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in our 10-K and other filings and materials which you can also find on our IR site or sec.gov.","And for Q&A, as always, we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question only, so that we can accommodate everybody. Feel free to join the queue again, and if time remains, we will call on you and we all look forward to speaking to you after the call ends.","And now to kick it off, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Mitch Barns","Yeah. Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment\u2019s progress with Total Audience measurement, and our Buy segment\u2019s continued strength in emerging markets and growing momentum with retailers. In both Watch and Buy, our teams are executing well. And there's a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year and beyond. ","But I'd like you to take away from this quarter's call is that we continue to deliver consistent growth and profitability, all while managing through the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. Our teams do great job of leveraging change as a means for progress as they continuously renew and improve the services we provide. We're continuing to gain client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework. Our complementary analytics business continues its strong growth and our global footprint remains a key competitive advantage. It's these factors in particular that give us continued confidence in our business and our strategy going forward. ","Looking at the first quarter financials. We had revenue growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.2% constant currency, reflecting our scalable business model and our continuous focus on productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew nearly 11% constant currency to $0.51. ","Our strong business model enables us to consistently invest in our future growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. Today we're announcing that our board has approved a dividend increase of 11%, increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share. ","During the quarter, we also continued to buy back our stock. And at the end of the first quarter we had almost $800 million remaining under the existing authorization. We remain committed to drive shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy. ","Lastly, we are reiterating our guidance for 2016. At a high level across both of our businesses, Watch and Buy, we do two things. We measure performance for our clients and we help them improve their performance. Measurement is the core of our business. It tells our clients what happened. Our analytics help them understand why it happened and what they should do next to improve. Measurement and analytics are two separate things and each is important and valuable on its own. But the connection of measurement with analytics makes them both even more useful and valuable. And our efforts to increase this connection are helping to fuel our growth and they'll continue to do so long into the future.","In our Watch business, first quarter revenues increased more than 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.5% increase in the measurement of video and text. We're seeing significant momentum with our Total Audience Measurement system where our focus is on driving client adoption. ","We also continue to expand and enhance our offerings to meet the full range of our clients' needs. A great example of this is our recently announced agreement with DISH Network to include their set-top box data as part of our industry standard TV rating service. Integrating DISH\u2019s data with our panel data fits perfectly with our hybrid approach: panels plus big data providing both the quality and granularity our clients need. This will both bolster our core measurement service and help fuel our analytics capabilities and initial feedback from our clients has of course been positive.","Looking at Digital Ad Ratings. Some of you have asked for an update on client adoption. We continue to make progress with publishers and advertisers alike. In March, we added Snapchat to our growing roster of leading digital publishers that already includes Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pandora. ","On the advertiser side, we recently were selected by Unilever in China and in July, Procter & Gamble will be coming on board in the United States.","We also are continuing to expand Digital Ad Ratings internationally. In 2016 we\u2019re adding eight new markets many of which are mobile first markets and that will bring the country total to 25. In China, Sina Weibo, a widely used social media site, has come on-board as a data partner, joining Tencent that we began working with last year. Also, in March, we acquired Informate, a leading mobile measurement provider in emerging markets to support our ongoing international expansion efforts.","On Digital Content Ratings, we have a wide range of clients spanning big media and digital natives evaluating their audiences for video and text based content, as well as a robust pipeline of clients who are actively integrating the SDK. For participating clients, we remain on track for syndication later this quarter. Syndicated reporting will continue to roll out for additional clients as they go through the on-boarding process throughout the year. Meanwhile we\u2019ll also be sharing data with our agency clients so they can increase their familiarity with the data. So a very good progress overall. ","Last week, Facebook announced at their F8 conference that they're opening up their instant articles program to all publishers around the world. Program has been a tremendous success for them as they seek to provide a better reading experience for their users and to help publishers reach their audiences. We\u2019re mentioning this because those audiences will be measured by Nielsen Digital Content Ratings. So this is a great example of the growing client adoption that we\u2019re seeing. ","Next, let\u2019s move to Total Content Ratings. We now have about 140 networks for whom we\u2019re reporting time-shifted viewing through day 35, enabling these clients to see the incremental contribution to their total audience. Additionally, we have 55 networks enabled for our measurement of video-on demand, including subscription video on demand through our Total Content Ratings reporting. Overall we're now covering over 8000 different program episodes, up from about 6000 last quarter. ","We also enhanced our coverage of TV connected devices, such as Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, and Amazon Fire. This data is flowing through our reporting of Total Content Ratings today, helping our clients to understand how viewing compares across the different brands of connected devices.","Regarding the effort to update the definition of the currency. In March, we had another productive meeting with key industry stakeholders as we continue to move towards a new expanded definition of currency for the marketplace. These discussions continue to progress well. And they're getting much more specific about how the elements of our Total Audience Measurement system will be used in the new definition of the currency. ","In advance of this year's upfronts and newfronts, our clients are actively engaging and evaluating our data from Digital Content Ratings and Total Content Ratings. We're helping them understand the comparable metrics and the impact to their businesses. It's crucial for us to work with our clients through this process and we'll continue to support them both in the broad client forums as well as in individual meetings. It\u2019s exciting really to see how these new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways that audiences are consuming content. Their use of these new metrics will continue to grow throughout the year leading to a more central role and even greater impact in next year's newfronts and upfronts.","One final component of Total Audience Measurement. We also recently announced Nielsen Digital Audio Ratings which measures radio listening via mobile apps and web players. Our ratings now capture broadcast radio's total reach. This also lays the groundwork for us to measure other audio platforms where people listen to music, news\/talk, sports and syndicated programs. Radio continues to have incredible reach with 93% of all adults listening to the radio each week, making it an important productive part of a brand\u2019s multi-media plan.","Let\u2019s turn to marketing effectiveness. We had revenue growth of nearly 30% in the quarter and this is largely where our Watch-related analytics fall. And over the past several years, we made significant investments in this space. As a result, we now produce the industry's most comprehensive suite of analytics solutions across the broader set of categories. In addition, Nielsen data also helps power many of our clients\u2019 own in-house selling and buying tools that you tend to hear more about around the time of the upfront. ","The role of analytics for assessing audience segmentation and advertising ROI as well as fueling activation will only continue to grow. We feel great about our position in this part of the market. Recently we strengthened that position through acquisitions like eXelate in 2015 and Pointlogic in March of this year. Even prior to our acquisition of Pointlogic, we worked with them to develop our Nielsen Media Impact service, which is a software solution for cross-media planning. And it's connected to our Total Audience Measurement system. ","Media Impact along with other products and Pointlogic enables agencies, media owners and advertisers to better plan, activate and optimize the value of their media investments. So you can see how this Pointlogic acquisition supports both our core measurement and our analytics services for our clients.","Now a moment ago, I mentioned our eXelate acquisition. And just last week we announced the official launch of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, formerly known as the enterprise marketing platform. Look, we know how much you guys love it when we change the name of one of our services, so there you go, that's this quarter. ","This Nielsen Marketing Cloud, its impact heavily leverages our eXelate acquisition. It integrates Nielsen data management, analytics, media planning and activation applications, all on a single platform to help brands reach consumers more efficiently and precisely and to help media companies sell more effectively. We recognize we're not the only one out there with the marketing cloud capability. But what sets ours apart is our access to the essential core data. That's a key reason why we're seeing strong initial momentum having already signed deals with over a dozen top fast moving consumer goods, pharma, spirits and media companies in Q1. ","Separately, we also recently announced a partnership with Time Warner, leveraging Nielsen\u2019s neuroscience and biometrics tools in their media lab to help them understand and leverage the changing ways audience is engaged with content and advertising. We have a similar long running partnership with CBS in their Television City facility. ","So again, while measurement has always been and will continue to be the core of our business, we're also a significant player in the analytics space, and our ability to connect measurement with analytics increases the value of each and will continue to drive growth for our business. ","Let\u2019s turn to Buy. In Buy segment, revenues increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis. In emerging markets, we\u2019re again the significant growth driver in the quarter with revenues up 10%. These markets experience volatility from time to time. But with it also comes tremendous growth opportunity. With our unmatched global footprint, supported by the investments we made in coverage for these markets over the past several years, we love our position. This quarter our teams once again executed well, and we saw solid growth with multinational and local clients as they invested in those measurements and analytics.","In developed markets, revenues grew 2% with our core measurement business remaining rock solid. We saw growth shoots in Europe for the second quarter in a row, which is encouraging and also a huge testament to the efforts of our teams and their solid execution. ","One of the keys in Europe -- in fact, one of the keys to our growth globally is our progress with our retailer clients. We've had good traction tapping into this opportunity and with our growth driven by our analytics capabilities as well as core measurement wins and renewals. And on that front, last week, we reached a new agreement with Walmart. It's a multi-year renewal of our relationship and it elevates Nielsen to the status of a preferred provider for Walmart\u2019s data. It also expands the range of our analytics work with Walmart and it includes the deployment of our latest technology solutions. Finally, the new agreement also grants Nielsen the ability to provide Walmart's store level market share to manufacturers beginning in July of 2016.","Moving on to coverage. In parallel with our Watch business\u2019 focus on Total Audience Measurement, our Buy business is focused on total consumer measurement across all channels, including ecommerce. In February, we announced some significant enhancements to our ecommerce measurement capability in the U.S. following the proven formula that combines our high quality panels with big data. This combination enables us to provide our manufacturer clients with both broad and granular coverages of their ecommerce sales, including on the largest platforms. Client reaction has been very positive. Also, recently announced partnership with Profitero further expands on our e-commerce capabilities.","Lastly, we're making excellent progress in our effort to build a platform-based system that aligns and connects our Buy businesses\u2019 wide variety of measurement and analytics data to drive increased value for our clients. We're thrilled to announce that Kellogg's has signed up to be one of the early adopters, partnering with us as we build up this connected system for our fast moving consumer goods clients. ","So as you can see, our teams have been busy, embracing the market changes and leveraging them as a means for progress as they execute on our strategy. That\u2019s the key to our ability to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, driving returns for our shareholders. ","We feel great about the quarter, and we feel great about the year ahead. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Over to you, Jamere. ","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. We had another great quarter. And I am pleased with the execution and efforts of our teams around the world. The year is off to a strong start and our results are indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model which continues to deliver solid results through the cycles. ","First, let me cover our total company results for the first quarter. Revenue was just under $1.5 billion, up 5.2% constant currency. We\u2019ve delivered 39 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. ","Our Watch business grew 6.3% on a constant currency basis, a great momentum in our Total Audience execution and impressive growth in marketing effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 4.3% constant currency led by continued strength in the emerging markets and new client wins. ","Adjusted EBITDA was $402 million, up 7.2% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 27%, up 49 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch. ad Buy segments. We continue to run the productivity play with intensity and our operations team led by John Tavolieri is executing against a strong pipeline of projects across the company. ","Adjusted net income was $187 million, up 9.4% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.51, up 10.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program.","We generated free cash flow of $14 million, up from a $1 million usage a year ago and we\u2019re driving working capital efficiencies within our business. As a reminder, the majority of our free cash flow is generated in the second third and fourth quarters. We remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million.","And finally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation by increasing the quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.31 a share. It's worth noting that our dividend has nearly doubled since its inception in 2013. Again, a great quarter with solid execution and a strong start at 2016. ","Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $694 million, up 6.3% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as audience measurement of video and text was up 7.5%. Audio was up nearly 1% and the business continues to deliver outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. ","Marketing effectiveness was up 28.8% behind strong results in eXelate and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. Marketing effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth as publishers and content owners seek to amplify the value of their ad inventories and advertisers seek to better identify audiences across all screens and platforms to improve the return on their investments. Other Watch is about a 2 points drag on Watch revenue, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. ","Let me say a few words about our key initiatives. Our total audience growth initiatives is off to a great start. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 58% behind strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We continue to see strong renewals and new wins with clients such as Videology, a demand-side video ad platform, Crackle, a screening TV network and Snapchat along with continued strength with top advertisers. ","Digital Content Ratings which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV is also off to a great start in 2016. In addition to clients who are evaluating video measurement data, we\u2019re making solid progress with text measurement with the most recent addition being Facebook for their instant articles content. ","And finally, our subscription video on demand product continues to gain traction as the number of episodes we are now measuring for our clients increased by nearly a third versus the prior quarter. ","Watch adjusted EBITDA was $297 million, up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 38 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continued to drive operating leverage in the business. In the quarter we signed a deal with DISH to integrate set-top box data into our ratings. The acquisition of this rich data set is included in our annual guidance and our teams are executing on our product plan. ","In addition to helping us strengthen our product over time, set-top box data will give us significant productivity benefits in operating and capital expense by enabling us to reduce the size and frequency of future panel expansions. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our total audience measurement growth strategies and marketing effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. ","Turning to Buy. Our business had a solid first quarter. First quarter total Buy revenue was $793 million, up 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $550 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis. And our business in the emerging markets was $243 million, up 10% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are continuing to execute in line with the guidance framework we gave for 2016. ","In the developed markets, our core measurement business was solid in our two largest markets: the U.S. and Western Europe. We also saw a broad-based growth in the emerging markets with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia along with mid to high single digits in Eastern Europe and Africa. Overall discretionary spend remained stable with relative strength in areas like innovation. ","Buy EBITDA was $114 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 43 basis points in the quarter. This is the seventh straight quarter of Buy margin expansion and we expect Buy to be a strong contributor to our margins in 2016 as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. Overall we had a good quarter in Buy with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis. ","Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 320 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. ","If yesterday\u2019s spot rates held constant through 2016, then we expect a 120 basis point drag on revenues and a 50 basis point drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly better than the forecast we gave last quarter.","Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out on our fourth quarter call, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 per share, and free cash flow of roughly $950 million. ","So to wrap up, the year is off to a great start. And coming out of the first quarter we have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure. We remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in form of dividends and buybacks. ","And with that, I will turn it back to Kate. ","Kate Vanek","Thanks so much. Carol, we\u2019d love to start Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger ","Hello world. Sorry for that snafu on the mute button. Listen, I am sure you\u2019ll get a long list of questions on the Watch segment, so I'd actually like to start on the Buy segment if I may. I remember as Watch was developing toward total audience, Mitch, you gave us a really nice outline of sort of the milestones over time that were necessary for that rollout and a rough time frame of how that would progress. I wondered if you could do something similar for the Buy segment when you think about the sort of move to the platform based system that you referenced. You referenced a few initial clients for how that will be rolling out. I would love to get a sense of the timing on how that service will evolve, what we could be looking for in terms of milestones and thinking about the growth potential over time? Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Todd, just to clarify, are you referring to e-commerce in particular or more generally? ","Todd Juenger ","Well, I think there's a bunch of elements, right, so I guess, more generally I am thinking about sort of the platform based -- the cloud based architecture around delivering the Buy set of products. As I understand it more as a new suite of service offerings that I think you hold some pretty exciting potential for as I understand what you're pursuing. So more holistically I think is the answer. ","Mitch Barns","Okay, yeah, I got you. I'm glad I asked, because I was assuming it was something else. We do have, maybe two different dimensions to coverage. One is measurement coverage. So in the developed markets that is not exclusively but it is largely about e-commerce -- adding e-commerce into the sales that we cover in our core measurement service right now. And in other markets around the world it might be more about geographic coverage or covering the marketplace with increasing granularity giving regional or even city level views and some of the faster growing emerging markets around the world. And this is what we've been investing in as a company for a number of years in emerging markets and then more recently our focus has now turned to e-commerce coverage for our retail sales measurement service in the developed markets around the world. That's one dimension. ","The second dimension that I think you're also touching on is how our range of services both measurement and our analytics capabilities cover the range of business questions that our clients have and that's where we're really putting together -- focused on putting together this system based platform oriented approach that we talked about most recently in a very in-depth way at our analyst day this past December. I mentioned it briefly at the end of my. prepared comments and that's where I referenced that Kellogg's has signed on to be one of our early adopters to partner with this as we build out this system. And what this is about is taking our core measurement service and our key analytics capabilities, the ones that are focused on the most common and most important business questions our clients have, each of these are valuable on individual basis right now. But they'll be even more valuable as we connect them together so that they function as an operating system if you will to support our clients\u2019 marketing and sales and innovation processes in their business. When our service is connected together on a technology platform and support one another and then that system connects directly with our client system, then that\u2019s going to be very powerful. ","Now, to your question about where we are -- milestones and timing, we're still in the earlier stages of putting that system together and that work will continue throughout this year and will be supported by the partnership with Kellogg's and other clients who I'm sure will want to get on board as well as we build that out. Milestones that you're going to see are just -- it'll be very similar to what we've talked about on the Watch side of the business with total audience measurement. There will be a steady growth in client adoption and clients adopting the key individual parts and then gradually over time you'll see them adopt the comprehensive system as well. And we'll be sure to update you on future earnings calls about how that's progressing. We don't have a whole lot more to say about it at this stage because we're still in the relatively early stages of that. ","As far as growth potential, where it really is going to come down to is what I commented on in my prepared comments. Measurement is important on its own. Analytics are incredibly important and valuable on their own. Connecting these two things together is where the incremental value delivery opportunity and growth opportunity comes for our business. And that's what we're focused on and pursuing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. ","Tim Nollen ","Thanks very much. One question on Total Audience Measurement, which is -- you're talking now again about syndicating the information later this quarter. I understand what that means but do you think this could lead to the entire industry talking more about total audience viewership of programming rather than the term ratings which we\u2019re always using, which is usually live plus same day or C3 and as we all know is limited in terms of total viewership. So will we as an industry be talking more about total viewership of TV programming starting in the next few months? ","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Tim. Great question. I think that's exactly where we would expect the industry to go. Right now when you hear people refer to Nielsen or Ratings, they are generally in most cases referring to the current definition of the currency, so C3 or C7, which is capturing an important part of total viewing but of course many parts are left out of the current definition of the currency. The total audience system is all designed to capture all of that viewing, all important viewing across all screens and platforms that are out there. ","Right now, there's a disconnect between what total audience measures and what the current definition of the currency that the market trades on captures. And so yeah, either you're going to see people start to talk about total audience exactly as you say, or I think just as likely, more likely perhaps, is that definition of the currency will be revised and expanded to include more of the viewing that\u2019s happening on these other platforms in these other viewing environments that our total audience measurement system were designed to capture. And so that's the tension -- a very positive and productive tension I think that is now growing and emerging in the marketplace. That's why we\u2019ve convened these discussions with a broad range of industry players to talk about redefining and updating the definition of the currency. And we're happy to say that those conversations have progressed well and gotten a lot more specific about what the options are for a new definition of the currency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. ","Toni Kaplan ","Hi, good morning. You mentioned that the set top box data that you will integrate from DISH could lead to needing less investment in panels in the future. So should we expect that Watch margins expand at a faster pace in future years, or would you expect that you would use some of that benefit to invest more in other areas, and also just how soon could we expect the DISH data to be incorporated in the local ratings? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson","Yeah. So a couple things, as I said, the set top box data integration is actually included in our guidance for earnings and free we cash flow. Over time we're confident that we're able to acquire the data and build the products within our existing long term financial framework, because we have a ton of experience already working with set top box data. And as I mentioned on the plus side, set top box integration is going to enable us to gain OpEx and CapEx efficiencies by reducing the size and frequency of panel expansions over time. You've got to remember that panels are very expensive. And so we expect those productivity benefits to be ploughed back in our business to either help us improve the profitability of our business and\/or reinvest that into new products over time. ","In terms of the timeframe of DISH being integrated, the teams are already working on the product plan and we won\u2019t be date certain about that integration. But the good news is that we have a lot of experience there and I would expect that by the end of the year we will have sort of the first generation of that in the marketplace for our clients to start to take a look at. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. ","Manav Patnaik ","I just wanted to try and get a little bit more color on your industry discussions that you talked about in terms of setting the new currency and sort of in the context of I guess -- when you said they\u2019re getting more specific, you know what are the, I guess, the critiques of what's out there, what needs to be done and maybe in the context of, also the competition obviously has been putting out a lot more of their own press releases around getting that total audience figure out. So does that come up in discussions, are they part of it or is it just you guys talking to the industry?","Mitch Barns","Hi, Manav, yes, thanks for the question. As far as getting more specific, we've just seen a very clear progression at these various broad meetings of all the industry players have accrued over the past several months, you see the conversation evolve. And then now we're looking at some very specific options, that's really what that reference is about. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to dig -- to go further than that and share the specific details. I want to get out in front of our clients on that. So I'm going to stop there as far as that goes. ","Your point about critiques in the marketplace, is a good one. And interesting is, look, everybody, Nielsen included, which is all of this were in the marketplace a year ago, if not even sooner than that. So that's one critique. And another critique is that as some of these elements of the total audience measurement system have rolled out, we also get the opposite, which is too fast. We need more time to understand the data and the impact on my business. And so we work closely with our clients on that to support them as they grow in their familiarity, understand the impact to their business. And as we've done throughout this process, we calibrate the timing of the next step of the rollout based on that kind of feedback. So the good news is the product is in great shape. We are continuing in our confidence that this system fits perfectly with what the market needs. And so we're going to continue to execute on our plan and build client adoption and work closely with the industry as each of these steps unfolds in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins ","Hi thanks, good morning. A margin question. You've talked about the margin contribution this year being more heavily weighted towards Buy than we've seen in the past. But for the first quarter on a constant currency basis, Watch and Buy margin expansion was pretty similar. Should we expect that gap to widen over the course of the year? And along with that, if you could help us think about the investments in Watch to support Total Audience Measurement. I know that it's already in the guidance. But in particular I'm thinking about areas like commercial investments to drive Digital Ad Ratings growth. Thanks. ","Jamere Jackson","Thanks, Sara. As we said earlier in the year, we expect Buy to be a larger contributor to margins in 2016 as we invest in total audience in Watch. In terms of those investments, those investments will include driving penetration of DCR and DAR, the effects of the panel expansion effort from 2015 will roll through the numbers this year and then the set top box integrations that we talked about. So we do expect over the course of the year those investments to ramp up on the Watch side and you'll see more of a gap between sort of the Watch margin expansion and the Buy margin expansion. But over time we'll get to the 50 to 70 basis points guidance for the total company for the total year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ryan Cary from Jefferies.","Ryan Cary ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We've seen some reports, some recent reports, that a number of networks are providing add guarantees outside of Nielsen, instead piecing together both internal and third-party data. And while it's clearly still very early and probably a relatively small slice, do you see this potentially becoming a larger concern going forward, or is this something more that you believe will be addressed with the broader use of Total Audience? ","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Ryan. Look, at that time of year around the upfront, this happens every year where a lot of the big media companies will come out with some of their own in-house selling tools, some of their own in-house analytics. And it's smart. They're looking to differentiate themselves from the pack and that's what good sellers do. So that's really what we're seeing right now. And one thing that's important to know is what's powering many of those in-house selling tools and a lot of those proprietary analytics that you're hearing about, is Nielsen data and Nielsen analytics. And in fact, it's one of the reasons why our marketing effectiveness business saw such good growth in the first quarter of this year, up almost 30%. So, look this is just the time of year. ","I think the important thing to think about when we see these metrics coming from the big media companies is to also think about it from the buyer side. So a buyer sees those proprietary metrics and of course they're interested in them. But they also want a broad view of the market. They want comparable metrics that enable them to compare across all of the places where they can invest their money and those captive metrics from the individual media companies don't satisfy that need that the buyers have on their side of the table. And Nielsen obviously supports that and it\u2019s in the central role that we play in the marketplace, that they're broad view, independence, in the picture. Meanwhile a lot of these other analytics still can be very helpful as additional use of the marketplace to provide supplementary guarantees -- supplementary understanding of how to find value as you seek audiences if you're an advertiser. ","Jamere Jackson","This has been good for our business. I mean if you look at marketing effectiveness growing 28.8% in the first quarter, and you look at some of the analytics that many of the media companies are using to differentiate themselves and amplify the value of their inventories, it's been good for our business as well. I mean our eXelate business is 44% in the quarter, Nielsen Buyer Insights is up 15%, Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up 42% in the quarter. So this explosion of analytics being powered by Nielsen data sets is really good for our business as well. ","Mitch Barns","And the way we orient those analytics is of course closely connected with our core measurement service. And the two both amplify the value of each other. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman ","Hi, Jamere, could you go over organic growth in the Watch segment and just remind us what you're adjusting for to make those organics? ","Jamere Jackson","So for the total company, we had about 70 basis points of inorganic contribution. It was a combination of eXelate and NCS, gave us about 130 basis points up, NRG was about a 60 basis points drag, if you were to take that down to Watch segment, the Watch segment was about 5% organic. And that was a combination of eXelate being about a point up, NCS giving you about two points up and then NRG being about 170 basis points drags, so 5% organic in Watch. Buy number of 4.3% was pretty much all organic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group.","Thomas Eagan ","Great. Thank you. There has been a lot of questions about deduplication and whether Nielsen or their competitors are better at deduplicating the audience. As campaigns become increasingly hybrid by design with linear and digital components, could you talk about that? Thank you. ","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Thomas. Incredibly important is this idea of de-duplicating the reach of ads and of campaigns in the marketplace. As an advertiser, reach has got to be your first priority, it's incredibly important. So if you\u2019re going to have a measurement system that covers all these different environments where consumers are consuming content, and then you're going to put them together to represent the total audience, being able to deduplicate that reach is really important to the buyers of that advertising inventory.","We have the best deduplication methodology out there in the market. And the reason for that is our access to persons level data. That's really the key. It's not about IP addresses or about devices. It's not about the size of your data set. It's really quality and it's access to persons level data. And that really plays to the historical strengths of our measurement system and also the strengths of how our Total Audience Measurement system was designed. And so we can always continue to advance our capabilities on things like this, and we will. But we have the best one out there now, and we know how important it is for the marketplace if you're going to deliver a total audience view to the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.","Jeff Meuler ","Thank you. Any additional perspective on the Buy developed markets growth. And I ask from the perspective, I know that Q4 was strong from a discretionary spend perspective, but I think you called out that discretionary spend is stable and you're still calling out Europe as a positive. So just any additional perspective would be helpful.","Jamere Jackson ","Yes. So our developed markets were 2% growth in the quarter. We guided 1.5% to 3.5% for the year. So the performance is in line with the guidance. I think we saw a couple of things. One, the US and Europe, which represent roughly 85% of our developed markets, had a very good quarter in terms of our core measurement business, both in the low single digits. Western Europe is actually strengthening. We saw strong results behind new clients and innovation. So core measurement, up low single. And the discretionary environment in Europe was actually improving. The discretionary environment was actually in the mid singles.","From a US standpoint, the core measurement is strong. And that's where we saw some of the increase in discretionary spend in the fourth quarter behind some historical data sets that we sold. So that cooled down a little bit. And remember, discretionary spending can be a little lumpy after a big quarter. So overall, at 2% growth, that's in line with our guidance. And we feel pretty good about our two largest markets performing very well through the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.","Brian Wieser ","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. As you know, there's many other companies out there with marketing technology suites and they all have different offerings. They often don't overlap. And with acquisitions and investments, they maintain the capacity to start running into each other, and potentially including yourselves and vice versa. So I'm wondering, with your Marketing Cloud product, do you have a framework for thinking about what you want Nielsen to do in this space, where you want to support -- versus where you want to support marketers' use of complementary software?","Mitch Barns ","Great. Thanks, Brian. This is largely about activation for our clients. We have lots of great data. We have lots of great analytics. Sometimes analytics are about helping our clients to learn to plan, to think about strategy. But in many cases, the analytics are really about action, activation. They want to use it to more precisely target the audiences in the marketplace that they're aiming at for their brand's growth, whether that's through advertising or through other elements of the marketing mix. That's what our cloud is designed to do. ","And what differentiates our cloud from some of the other cloud capabilities out there in the marketplace is our access to the essential core data. We start with the core data, whereas other cloud providers maybe have great technology but they have to go find the data. So that's our point of differentiation. The way our commercial teams are approaching this going forward is we're not going to take a proprietary approach where everything has to go through our cloud. We're going to have our cloud out there. It will have its strengths. And clients who want to work with us on our cloud-based capabilities for activation, we're going to work with them and we'll be very happy to do it. But in other cases, a client might choose to use some other provider's cloud and we're going to collaborate very productively with those other cloud-based providers, because we know the value of our data. And it'll be very important to those other cloud-based providers to have access to the essential core data that Nielsen brings to the table.","So we're going to work through both models. All the value ultimately comes back to our data, which is our historical strength and our most important point of leverage in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin ","I really just wanted to know how we should think about monetization of Total Audience Measurement as you approach syndication and then how we should think about the impact on reported revenue growth, both in the second half of this year and 2017 versus recent, I think you put up constant currency growth in Watch above your 6%, the upper end of the range for the last two of the last three quarters?","Mitch Barns ","Thanks, Andre. Well, I think the way to think about Total Audience, at least right now, is that it's one of the reasons why our business has continued its solid mid single digit growth in what is a very dynamic and changing marketplace. With our Audience Measurement of Video and Text up 7.5% in the quarter, one of the reasons is our clients continue to invest in our capabilities because they see what Total Audience is able to do and they see how it fits with where their business needs to go. That's why our contract renewals with our big media clients are good. That's why our analytics capabilities in our Marketing Effectiveness business, why that business continues to grow so well. And so for our big media clients, that's the way we monetize this capability.","We also have, though, the digital first clients out there. More of that revenue, that Total Audience, attracts more of that is incremental to our business. But it's a smaller component of our total revenue picture. And while it certainly contributes to our growth and will continue to do so, it's not the more important of the two. The more important of the two is the core business that we have with our big media clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could offer some more color on the Marketing Cloud. Hoping you can perhaps explain what you've added, improved or augmented since you've bought eXelate or when it was just EMP. And then finally, any thoughts on how you expect the product offering and opportunity to evolve over time. Thanks.","Mitch Barns ","Great question. We just rolled it out. You're exactly right that eXelate is at the center of this Marketing Cloud capability. But other than that, what we're doing is taking already existing components, which were valuable on a standalone basis, and we're bringing them together and connecting them in a system in this Marketing Cloud capability. So we didn't have to go invent new capabilities or, at the moment, not important new components to this Marketing Cloud. What's new is the connectedness of all of these already proven capabilities, and then delivering that system of capabilities to our clients so they can activate with even more precision, more efficiency and more speed. But yes, clearly, powered by the capabilities that came to Nielsen through our acquisition of eXelate in 2015. Otherwise, not requiring any new invention or any new components, at least not at the initial launch.","But even having said that, as we mentioned, very strong initial interest from clients across a pretty broad range of industries already here in the first quarter, and you're going to continue to see the clients who are signing on to our Marketing Cloud capability grow throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur from Huber Research.","Douglas Arthur ","Jamere, just on the 10% growth at Buy's emerging markets. You may have touched on this before, but how do you see that playing out for the rest of the year? Any wobbles that you're expecting in subsequent quarters, or do you see that trend lining?","Jamere Jackson ","Yes, we guided 8% to 10% for the year. We still feel pretty good about that guidance range. Certainly, I'm encouraged by the performance in the first quarter where we saw a broad-based growth. But there\u2019s no indicator today that would suggest that we need to change what we put out in terms of guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon ","Hey good morning, everyone. I'll return to the Buy segment with maybe a question for Mitch on the expanded Walmart deal, maybe two parts. You mentioned the preferred provider designation. Could you tell us a little bit about how exclusive that is versus some of your competitors for certain products? And then maybe more importantly, what you think it may be able to do to generate interest from other clients? Is there a bit of a flywheel effect to it? Thanks.","Mitch Barns ","Thanks, Dan. Yes, I\u2019d be happy to talk a little bit more about this. The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they referred to as a primary provider in the past to a status of preferred provider. What it is, it's a signal to the marketplace that if you're going to come, and if you're a supplier to Walmart and you're going to come to Walmart and you want to make your pitch, they want you to use Nielsen's data, Nielsen's hierarchy. They want a common hierarchy, a common view of the world for the providers, the suppliers as they come to Walmart. That helps Walmart, obviously, operate more efficiently, less variation in all the different views that they have to interpret as their pitch to buy their suppliers. And so that's what that means. It doesn't mean that a supplier can't use data from another measurement provider, but Walmart's signaled their clear preference for how a supplier should pitch to them.","The other things that this deal expands on, it increases the analytics work that we do for Walmart. We already were doing some analytics with them. They like that. They've seen it as being valuable. And so basically, what this contract renewal does is it makes that work continuous with them as opposed to more project oriented. And it's a real strong validation of the value that they've seen from whether it's the pricing analytics or the assortment optimization analytics, all the different things, including our marketing mix capabilities, because of course Walmart is a big advertiser and so our marketing mix capabilities help them to get more ROI out of the money that they spend to promote their brand.","This other element that I mentioned, too, which is we're now, for the first time, enabled to provide Walmart's suppliers with store level market share. That's a key thing, too. So if you go around into your town, if you have a Walmart where you live, there's a Walmart there, there's a trading area that's defined around that individual store. So suppliers always knew what their sales were in that store, but they didn't necessarily know what their market share was in that trading area around that Walmart store. So now we're able to provide that kind of perspective. And that is really important to both Walmart and to Walmart's suppliers, the manufacturers that we're also working with. Those are the key components.","And then as far as how it will play beyond Walmart, well, it's a signal to the other retailers in the industry that the biggest retailer in the industry has designated Nielsen as its preferred provider. We're certainly very happy about that. We think that's quite meaningful. And then in the other markets around the world where we already work with Walmart, we look to leverage some of the components of this relationship with Walmart in the US, and many of those other markets where we're already actively engaged with this, the biggest retailer in the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Sterne Agee.","Hamzah Mazari ","Just a question on the Buy segment. Mitch, could you give us a sense of what percent of emerging markets within Buy are still underpenetrated or lack scale? A couple years ago, you guys had highlighted the margin gap between early stage versus late-stage emerging markets, so just trying to get a sense of the opportunity there. Thank you.","Mitch Barns ","At some level, I would say all of them. Because I know some of our Nielsen teams are listening on the call and we want them always to be. And there's truth to it that emerging markets -- there's always been two opportunities for us. One is to sort of catch up to the rapid pace of change in these markets, which we've done very successfully in the last several years. And then the other opportunity is created around keeping up with that ongoing pace of change, and that's going to continue in a lot of these markets. ","So as that happens, there's also another dimension, which is the maturity of marketing in those markets. So if you look backwards, a lot of the growth for our clients is about gaining distribution as the retail environment starts to develop and as it develops, and especially in the larger cities, then it starts to become more about a market share gain. And that's where a lot of our analytics capabilities start to become more important. So we're still underpenetrated on that front in almost all of the most important emerging markets around the world. And so when we look out into the future, we still see very good growth opportunity. And we continue with this 8% to 10% range, not only for this year, but as far as we can see into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Tim McHugh ","Wanted to ask on the set-top box data. You talked about the savings there. But how much more investment is necessary? Do you want more data sets, or is the DISH relationship enough for you to build, I guess, what you envision using that for, in terms of your measurement approach?","Mitch Barns ","Thanks, Tim. First, we're happy with the DISH deal, very happy with the DISH deal. But we are looking to add to it. And the good news is, we've got a lot of options out there. But also, the good news is we don't need them all. The key is coverage. So it's not about quantity as much as it is about coverage. And each of them has a slightly different footprint or skew to it. It's putting together the right combination that then gets put together with our high quality measurement service that's already out there, the panel-based approach, putting those two data sets together to get the best of both worlds. So again, we have a lot of options out there. We're looking to add more, but we don't need them all. Jamere, anything to add to that?","Jamere Jackson ","No, I think you covered. The key is coverage. You don't need every provider. And you can build products within existing financial framework, because we've got a ton of experience working with the data already.","Mitch Barns ","Yes. And I think Jamere mentioned it before, which is when you start to add set-top box data into the mix, it relieves some of the pressure on our high-quality panels. So the need to increase the size of those panels to deliver against what our clients need, some of that pressure gets backed off because you get some of the needs delivered by the set-top box data.","Operator","Our final question this morning comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee ","I wanted to ask about the retailer opportunity in Buy. And last year, you've talked a lot about that. But could you give us some historical context? What has been the revenue contribution from retailers? How big do you see that opportunity? And how much do you have to develop your offerings more to really go after that versus what you've already got in place today? Thank you.","Mitch Barns ","Thanks, Gary. Look, we've been very, very focused on retailers for a little bit more than the past year, because not only they are important data providers that help fuel our retail measurement service, which they have been for a long time, but we also see a growing opportunity for our business to support them in their marketing and merchandising efforts, just how they run their business overall. We do a lot of that through the analytics capabilities that we have, and also we know that a lot of our Watch data assets could be very valuable and important to the retailers. So we've been more focused on that in the past year or so, and we've been seeing very good growth with our retailer clients all around the world. Big retailer in Europe called Casino, we've done some very large projects and doing a lot of work with them. Giant Eagle, Dollar General, we mentioned Walmart, Target, Meijer, lots of major retailers that we really stepped up our level of engagement and the breadth of our activity with. And a lot of that additional activity has been around the analytics capabilities that we bring to the picture. ","We said on the last earnings call that we still are under penetrated in this area and that we see 0.5 point of global growth from retailers over the next three to five years.","Kate Vanek ","Operator, I think that wraps us up.","End of Q&A","Operator","Absolutely. I'll just turn the call back over to the presenters for any concluding remarks.","Kate Vanek ","Wonderful. Thank you all for your great questions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nielsen N.V. Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Nielsen's third quarter 2014 financial performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer; and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. The slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website at nielsen.com\/investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, as always, I'd like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of '95. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, October 23, 2014.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in our 10-K and other filings and materials that you can also find in our website.","For today's call, Mitch will start with comments on our results for the quarter and an overview of some key highlights, and he will provide a business update there. Then Jamere will discuss financials and will provide updates on our full year guidance. [Operator Instructions]","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Jamere and I appreciate the opportunity to update you on our business.","In the third quarter, we continued along our well-established path of consistent growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. And we continue to move forward with product innovation, new client wins and new partnerships, all of which serve to further extend our leadership position in the global marketplace.","Let's walk through a high-level look at the quarter. First, revenue. Revenue grew over 14% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding our acquisitions of Arbitron and Harris Interactive, core top line growth was 3.4%, driven by strong growth in Audience Measurement, double-digit growth in Ad Solutions and double-digit growth in the emerging markets, offset somewhat by anticipated softness in our Insights business in North America.","Next, adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 20% or 22% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of our Arbitron acquisition as well as great execution by our operating units. Adjusted net income per share was $0.66, up 35% constant currency. And our free cash flow of $289 million was up 17% in the quarter versus the prior year.","Turning to 2 additional financial items. First, as you saw in our press release this morning, our board has authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $1 billion. We also have approximately $400 million remaining under our previous share repurchase authorization, and we'll look to exhaust that capacity by the end of 2014. Our overall share repurchase program reflects our strong balance sheet and strong free cash flow.","The second, guidance. We're on track to achieve the revenue and any per-share ranges we provided to you back in December. With one quarter left, we're tightening up the ranges. And Jamere will share that with you in a few minutes.","To sum up, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. Our strong business model lends itself to continued revenue growth and margin expansion, and we remain confident about the future.","Moving to Slide 6. Our mission every day is to measure consumer behavior around the globe. Our analytics are a critical link in helping our clients understand and act on what's happening in the market, which then helps them grow revenue and profit. And with this in mind, we have a number of key initiatives in progress that I would like to touch on.","But before I walk through the specific initiatives in the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to put some context around the environments in which we operate. First, Watch. The video landscape, it's evolving, and that's creating growth opportunities for us, both at present and as far as we look into the future.","Fragmentation continues to increase. Behavior is shifting as consumers take more control over when and how they choose to view content. And as they do, we see it's not a zero-sum game because video consumption continues to grow. Choice leads to more. And this is true across every demographic, and Nielsen is positioned to measure all of that viewing, traditional TV and digital video. Let me say it again. We're positioned to measure all of that viewing, traditional TV and digital video.","Overall, our Audience Measurement revenues, both digital video and traditional TV, they grew 6% during the quarter. Our effort to seize the growth opportunity largely revolves around OCR, and we couldn't be more pleased with the momentum.","In 2014, we've seen a surge in adoption of OCR from the entire marketplace, advertisers, agencies, publishers and ad platforms, as evidenced by the nearly 10,000 campaigns initiated year-to-date, more than double the number in 2013. Most recently, we were selected by the Korean automaker, Hyundai, to measure their online campaigns. And in fact, they join a long list of automakers and their agencies that are engaging with OCR.","We also recently renewed our contract as the preferred supplier for digital audience measurement services in Australia in a highly competitive process. And a major factor in that win was our capability with mobile measurement. Adding mobile coverage has been #1 on nearly every client's list, and now they have a solution.","In fact, they have 2 Nielsen options to choose from. Recall that our July launch of mobile OCR was met with strong initial demand. And adoption continues to trend well, with mobile accounting for nearly 10% of all impressions currently measured by Nielsen, and the growth is accelerating. And then, in September, for our television clients, we launched a platform to enable crediting of mobile TV viewing into our C3 currency ratings for the clients who choose to monetize their mobile TV viewing that way.","So just to be clear, we're offering those clients 2 ways to monetize their mobile viewing, mobile OCR or mobile TV ratings. It's their choice. They can use whichever one fits their business model best. These flexible solutions are a key part of making comparable, cross-platform measurement a reality, and we're alone in our ability to provide this complete view to the market.","We also made some big moves this quarter on Digital Content Ratings, which you'll hear us refer to sometimes as DCR going forward. We can now offer clients syndicated ratings of audiences for all types of digital content using the same measurement architecture as OCR, which, of course, measures audiences for ads.","Digital Content Ratings complement and strengthen the value of OCR because content ratings help agencies and publishers plan and predict OCR outcomes more confidently. OCR has been progressing quite well even without that complementary metric of Digital Content Ratings. But with the launch of Digital Content Ratings, OCR only gets better.","Earlier this week, we announced an important strategic alliance with Adobe, a leading player in the world of digital content. And this alliance enables us to bring Digital Content Ratings to the market more efficiently and also directly linking them to Adobe's analytics for our mutual clients. This is a really big deal, as shown by the enthusiasm of our clients like Univision, ESPN, Turner Broadcasting, Viacom and others, and we're thrilled to be working with Adobe on this.","Turning to local television. This is a topic that's received considerable attention lately. Our clients are looking to Nielsen for an improved measurement of their audience. And we currently have 2 tracks in place towards that goal. The first track is focusing on upgrading our current measurement system by increasing our panel sizes and adding electronic measurement in more markets, and this is well underway.","The second track focuses on supplying a complementary stream of data, separate from our currency ratings, which will draw on our panels as well as other data sets, including set top box data. This second stream will provide the marketplace a new way to analyze and describe the nature and qualities of TV audiences for the clients who choose to take advantage of it. Local is an important part of our business, and we're fully committed to it and our role as the currency provider for the market.","Next, Audio. It's now been 1 year since we acquired Arbitron, and we couldn't be more pleased with the integration of that acquisition and what we're doing to bring better measurements and better analytics to this market. This speaks volumes about the quality of leadership and teamwork of my Nielsen colleagues in our Watch business. We continue to make progress towards our goal of aligning the market on a digital measurement solution, and we'll be sure to keep you posted on those developments.","Finally, Ad Solutions or our marketing effectiveness. As you know, a big part of this is about connecting what consumers watch with what consumers buy, which, of course, we're very well positioned to do. We not only help chief marketing officers measure the ROI of their marketing, but we also help them improve that ROI, and there's a lot of demand for this. So it's no surprise that our revenues in Ad Solutions continue to grow at a good pace during the quarter, up 12%.","Turning to Buy. We continue to win new clients in our Buy business. They're coming to Nielsen because they view Nielsen as the best partner to help them manage the performance of their business. They like the enhancements we're making to our technology platforms, and they appreciate our strong retailer relationships.","One recent example is L'Or\u00e9al in the U.S., the latest in a series of new client wins. We also continue to strengthen our partnership with our existing clients, helping them to improve their new product success rates, their marketing ROI and their sales effectiveness.","Our analytics help drive not only our clients' growth, but also the growth of their retailer partners. For example, in the area of sales effectiveness, our assortment optimization capabilities help improve the alignment between product availability and consumer demand to the benefit of both the manufacturer and the retailer.","Next, let's turn to Japan. We don't often talk about Japan because Japan is the one major developed market where we do not measure retail sales for our consumer packaged goods clients. But in recent weeks, we forged a new commercial alliance with a company in Japan called Intage, a leading information provider in that market. Under our agreement, we will market their retail measurement data for Japan to our clients outside of Japan, and they will sell Nielsen's global retail measurement data to interested companies in Japan.","Finally, e-commerce. This is an area we continue to like because of the powerful long-term opportunity that it represents. On our July call, we discussed our Omni Channel service in partnership with Alibaba. As we continue to build out our capabilities, we're seeing growing demand across categories as our clients look to Nielsen for insights on how and where to achieve success on the world's largest e-commerce platform. There's more, lots more activity in this area, in fact, in the U.S., in India, in Southeast Asia and several other markets.","But to be clear, the revenue associated is still relatively small so far. So you might ask, \"Why does he talk about e-commerce all the time?\" Well, the answer is simple. Because it's a glimpse into the future. Let's think about it. In an e-commerce world, you have Watch and Buy. It's digital, personal, real-time, and when combined with the big trends of mobile device ubiquity and hyperconnectivity, you begin to see the convergence of the offline and the online worlds. Simply put, today's e-commerce environment is a great context for understanding how Nielsen's strategy and portfolio will play in the broader market of the future. And when we look at it, we like what we see. It's yet another reason for us to be optimistic about the future of our business.","Jamere, over to you.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. And as Mitch indicated, we had another quarter of solid execution. Revenue was $1.57 billion, up 14.4% constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Arbitron and Harris acquisitions, revenue grew 3.4% constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was $477 million, up 22% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.3%, up 188 basis points, as we saw very strong margin expansion in the business.","Adjusted net income was $256 million, up 36.9% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.66, up 34.7% versus prior year. Finally, we generated $289 million in free cash flow, up a very strong 17% versus a year ago. Look, overall, I am pleased with the execution of our teams around the world and the solid results that we delivered in the quarter.","Next, I'll move to segment revenue and give you a little color on the pieces. As I mentioned, revenue was up 14.4% for the quarter, and we saw strength in both Watch and Buy. This also marks the 33rd consecutive quarter of revenue growth for our business, reflecting our continued ability to deliver top line growth through the cycles.","Our total Buy revenue was $878 million, up 4.9% in constant currency and up 2% excluding the Harris acquisition. Our information business grew 3.7% to $677 million constant currency. We benefited from continued demand in retail measurement services, key client wins and double-digit growth in our emerging markets.","Our Insights business revenue was $201 million, up 9.2% constant currency. Excluding Harris, Insights was down 3.8%. Now as we anticipated on our 2Q call, we saw some client tightening in North America. As I've said, and we've said many times, Insights is the portion of our business that has more discretionary client spend, and this is typically what we see in tighter spend environments. One bright spot was the growth in emerging markets as our clients continue to invest to build out their analytics capabilities.","Emerging markets were up 10.3% as we continue to see broad-based growth in many of our markets. And in particular, we saw strong growth in Greater China, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East. And this year, we have seen our continued commitment to investing in coverage and capability really pay off for us in terms of revenue growth rates, and we remain confident in our strategy.","Finally, our Watch business revenue was $694 million, up 29.2% constant currency or 5.6% excluding Arbitron. We see continued strength in Audience Measurement. Our Digital initiatives have tremendous momentum. And once again, we saw double-digit growth in Ad Solutions.","Moving to profitability. Buy EBITDA was $171 million, up 4.9% constant currency. Buy margins were flat in the quarter and moving in the right direction while we continue to invest in emerging markets. I'll tell you, this is a big focus area for our team. We will continue to invest in emerging markets coverage to fuel long-term growth and support our clients. And as I said, we remain confident in our strategy. There are tremendous growth opportunities for us, and we'll keep running the play.","On the Watch side, EBITDA grew 33.8% to $317 million constant currency, driven by the addition of the Arbitron business, continued progress on our productivity initiatives and solid operating leverage in our Audience Measurement business. So overall, profitability remains very strong, our teams are executing well and we continue to invest in our key growth catalysts.","Next, I'll move to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this is strictly the translation impact for reporting purposes.","Hence, in the quarter, we had foreign currency impacts that resulted in a 110 basis points drag on revenue and a 220 basis points drag on EBITDA. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through the rest of the year, then we expect a 290 basis points drag on revenue and a 300 basis points drag on EBITDA in the fourth quarter.","I'll move on to the balance sheet and key metrics. On the top left are some of the key financial metrics, which were all in line with our expectations, including the great cash flow performance that we had in the quarter. On the bottom left is our net debt ratio. Our gross debt is $6.6 billion with $369 million in cash to get to $6.3 billion of net debt and a 3.4x net leverage ratio.","On the capital table on the right, there have been no significant changes since our 2Q call and our weighted average interest rate is 3.86%. We completed the refinancing of the remaining $800 million of 7 3\/4% notes in the quarter and incurred a charge of $51 million associated with the refinancing of this debt.","Next, I'll move to capital allocation. As part of our annual strategic plan, we evaluated our capital allocation options. We will continue to have a balanced capital allocation approach. Our strong free cash flow generation gives us the ability to grow our business and return capital to shareholders with a growing dividend and a meaningful share repurchase program.","And as Mitch mentioned, today, we announced plans to increase our share repurchase by $1 billion, bringing our total remaining authorization to $1.4 billion. Now we have contemplated execution in 2 steps: One, execute the remaining $400 million of our existing authorization by the end of the year; and two, execute the additional $1 billion by mid-2016. Executing the remaining authorization this year would take leverage up to roughly 3.5x. We still intend to keep leverage over the long term in the 3x area.","Our balanced capital allocation approach demonstrates our commitment to drive shareholder returns while maintaining our ability to drive growth, maintain a strong balance sheet, make strategic acquisitions and increase our dividend, at least in line with earnings.","Finally, I'll turn to guidance. We are updating our 2014 guidance. We now see total revenue growth at approximately 12% and core revenue growth in the 4% to 4.5% range. Adjusted EBITDA margin rates remain unchanged. We now anticipate adjusted net income per share in the $2.50 to $2.55 range from our prior range to $2.45 to $2.55. Reflective of our updated buyback plans, we expect leverage to end the year at 3.5x. And we're pleased to reaffirm our free cash flow guidance of roughly $700 million.","On the right-hand side, we lowered our cash tax guidance to $160 million to $170 million. And finally, based on our share repurchase intentions in 4Q, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will go down by almost 1 million shares.","So to wrap up, we're pleased with our execution in the third quarter, we have exciting growth opportunities ahead of us and we're delivering on our commitment to return capital to shareholders in a meaningful way.","With that, I'll turn it back to Kate.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks so much. Leanne, we'd love to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'd love to hear a little bit more, if you wouldn't mind, about this new news of the week, the Adobe partnership. And what I'm trying to sort out is, as your clients decide whether to use Nielsen and its various measurement capabilities for -- to measure their digital campaigns versus using somebody else to do that, how does -- what criteria they usually use? And how does this partnership improve your position in that regard? And I do have a follow-up, if you don't mind.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Todd. Look, it is, in fact, the biggest reason why we're so excited about this launch of Digital Content Ratings, which is enabled in a big way by this partnership with Adobe. OCR has been doing really well in the marketplace, even without this complementary metric of Digital Content Ratings. But now, it will do even better. And the way to think about it is like this. These 2 metrics, Digital Content Ratings and OCR, are very complementary of one another. Let me give you an example of how it might work. For instance, way back in the day, I was a brand manager at P&G on the Pampers brand. So if I had digital back then, I mean, here's the way I would've used these tools. I would've used Digital Content Ratings to find the best sites and the best programs to deliver my target consumer, which, for the Pampers brand, would've been mothers of babies in diapers under the age of 24 months. So Digital Content Ratings would tell me where to best go find those target consumers. Then I would build my media plan around that. We would execute on a media plan. Then OCR would tell me whether or not I got what I paid for and how many of the people did I -- did my plan actually deliver. And so having those 2 metrics, as comparable as they possibly can, the one used for the planning, the one used for the transacting, makes the best overall system, the most powerful system. And so in that sense, the launch of Digital Content Ratings bolsters the value and the strength of OCR in the marketplace. And that's why we're fired up about this. Now the relationship with Adobe is important because Adobe is a big player in the world of digital content. They touch somewhere in the range of 70% of all content of the web already through their Adobe Analytics and other services that they provide to the marketplace. And so by partnering with Adobe, we can get reach of our Digital Content Ratings capability in the market much more efficiently and much more quickly than we otherwise could if we were to just do this on our own. And so, very excited about that. And there's an additional aspect here, which is, by partnering with Adobe, for our mutual clients, they'll have both site analytics that they get from Adobe and also Audience Measurement well integrated in the same system. And this is something that the market has always wanted, and now we're going to be delivering it. And I think it's, again, one of the reasons why our clients are so excited about this development, and I mentioned some of those earlier.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Clearly, a lot to talk about there. And listen, I don't want to be greedy with my time. But if you don't mind, I can't help just -- I have to ask. There's so much going on in the world of TV ratings. Would just love to hear your quick thoughts on the -- really, the impact of some pretty shocking declines in reported audiences. And for you guys, the question is, what does that mean for your priorities, your relationships and the work that you're doing with your television network media clients?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Todd. Well, that has been a topic of conversation in the marketplace, the concern about declining TV ratings. There was some recent news that was more positive on that front where there was some reasons to be encouraged about some of the new fall premieres where viewing and ratings are reason for optimism right now. But still, taking your question in a broader context, look, I go back to our strategy, which is focusing on the consumer and measuring that consumer across all the environments where they might find and consume video content. And so whether they're watching it through traditional television, which is what the traditional Nielsen TV ratings reflect, or whether they're watching it on other screens in other environments, guess what? We're there. We're measuring it across all of those locations. And then, our job is to provide that complete view back to the -- back to our clients, that complete view of the consumer. And so sometimes, I think the focus is perhaps a little bit too narrow, just focusing on television and not looking at total viewing. And the reality is, total video consumption is growing. Even if TV ratings are flat or perhaps even down in a given quarter, total video consumption has continued to grow. And again, it goes back to that idea of more consumer control, more consumer choice. Choice leads to more.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mitch, I'm going to go for your set-top box comment. You made an introductory remark that Nielsen will emphasize other streams for analytics, including set-top box for media measurement. Obviously, Nielsen's had access to set-top box data for years. It just never seemed to be a priority within the analytics mix. But this fall, I know you signed a partnership as well. It just seems like it's a higher priority for Nielsen. What's changed?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, thanks, Andrew, for the question. Look, we've long seen the opportunity related to set-top box data. And in fact, we are actively using it already in a few parts of our business. For instance, in ad solutions, our Nielsen Catalina Solutions unit, which has been performing very well, clients are very pleased with what that group does, they're big users of set-top box data as they look to combine the views of what consumers are watching and what consumers are buying. So yes, we're very comfortable, very familiar with set-top box data. And we find a lot of value in it for purposes of analytics. Now turning to the question of Audience Measurement, we've also -- we have a lot of experience looking at, working with set-top box data for that purpose, too. And our general sense of it is that, as a standalone source of data, it has a number of issues. And so it just isn't sufficient, it isn't of sufficient quality as a standalone source of data for purposes of audience measurement. But combined with other sources of data that can compensate for some of those weaknesses of set-top box data, then it can be useful. And that's the likely way that it will continue to unfold in our business going forward. Still a very important ingredient in our analytics capabilities, and we continue to work with it and look to find opportunities to make it a part of our overall mix for Audience Measurement going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I have a question then a follow-up after. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper into the traction on the mobile ratings that you guys alluded to. When I think about the opportunity there, there's sort of -- there's 3 constituents, the advertisers, the traditional media players who you're rating on other platforms right now and then the new players, the publishers, probably more on the online side who you haven't historically rated. So can you talk about traction within those 3 buckets? How are they different? How are those constituents all looking at the product? And then, I have a follow-up question.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, David. Look, we're really excited about the progress our mobile measurement suite has made, and I think one of the key reasons is because we do offer this choice for certain players in the market where that choice is really important. Remember, we just launched mobile measurement, starting on July 1. That was on schedule. We're very proud of that, that we've maintained the schedule given the difficulty that this involves, and then we brought the mobile TV ratings option, that second option that I mentioned earlier, out to the marketplace, just in September. So they're still fairly early. But already, the client adoption in the usage is very strong. I mentioned earlier, it's accounting for about 10% of all impressions that we are measuring across our Audience Measurement business. And it is very broad based, to your point. Advertisers, traditional media players and digital publishers, and I think it really speaks to the strength of OCR, just in terms of its product design. By the way, I would even add a fourth group, and that would be sort of the ad tech group. Some of the segments in ad tech, ad exchanges, ad servers, ad networks. In fact, they were some of the earliest adopters and biggest users of OCR. And so our mobile measurement, our -- and then all based on that OCR architecture, I think, it has been very well received all across the market. And that's the way it should be, right? If your metric is going to really serve an entire market well, it has to work for both sides of the table, the advertiser and agency side and then also the media player side, both traditional media and also the pure play digital publishers. So we couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making and how it looks going forward.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Perfect. And I guess, I had a follow-up. I guess, it's sort of a follow-up on the first question, which is, there has been some controversy around ratings, as you guys are well aware. But the way I look at it is, Nielsen is kind of like the referee enforcing the rules of the game that other people are essentially handing down to them, I think, really, the advertisers, frankly. Do you ever get tempted to get involved in the dialogue about what should actually be measured?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Not sure exactly where you're going with that, David. Do you want to maybe give me a little bit more color or do you want me to take a shot at it?","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, the measurement, the OC -- the C3 measurement is like -- that's the measurement that the game has asked you to measure, right? So are you ever tempted to get in the dialog and say, \"We'll measure whatever you want us to measure. But maybe you're asking us to measure the wrong thing\"?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, in the case of mobile, let's go back to mobile, again, when we've offered this choice, so mobile OCR, mobile TV ratings. Mobile OCR is, of course, the obvious choice if you're a digital publisher. If you're a TV network and you're going to have mobile content delivered, you can then choose to measure it either of the 2 ways. And so if that's what you're referring to, no, we don't -- we're not advocating for one or the other. We're making both options available. And then a client will choose one of those 2 options based on how they want to monetize that viewing. Whatever best fits their business model. So the way it would work, for instance, is -- let's say I'm a TV network. I'm going to push my mobile -- my content out through mobile apps, people are going to view that content through apps. Then I -- before I do that, I have to make a decision about how I'm going to monetize that viewing. If I want to monetize it by having that viewing included in the C3 currency ratings, then I have to have the same ad loads and I'm essentially -- yes, the same ad loads as what appeared on linear television, all right? So that would be that model and then those -- that viewing which would show up in the C3 ratings. But if I want to have, for instance, dynamic ad insertion or have a different ad load or target a different group of consumers, then I'm probably going to prefer to have that viewing measured as mobile OCR. In which case, it wouldn't show up in the C3 currency ratings, but it'll show up in other ratings that we report to the market. And I think this is something that some people in the market have missed, that there are 2 ways for this viewing to show up and they're both ratings and they both are monetizable, in fact, fully. And so we don't preference one or the other for our clients. It's their choice.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. And the only thing I'd add is that, again, what we're trying to do here, from a strategy standpoint, is we're going to follow the consumer. And so there are capabilities within the company that give us the ability to do that. So what we actually measure and what actually shows up in the ratings are 2 different things, and our capability is much broader than what shows up in the ratings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to turn to Insights and just [ph] a client that you've seen there. How do you know it's cyclical and not structural? And could you talk about where clients are pulling back their spending or maybe spending more?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Sara. Look, I think you've always heard us say that this is always the lumpier side of our revenues. And a big reason for that is some of these products in our Insights portfolio are more discretionary than other parts of our portfolio, in particular the core measurement services we provide. When we look at our Insights business over the past quarter, in fact, there are some products in that portfolio that are even more discretionary than others. And it just so happens that those are the ones with the biggest pullback. They tend to be -- well, what we saw was it's the services that are related to helping clients segment the market. So they like to segment the market and then determine which are the best opportunities, the priority segments, and then they focus their marketing activities on those groups of consumers. These are really important, really useful services that we provide our clients, but they're almost never urgent. And so these are the easiest services for the clients to push off or delay until some other part of the cycle that they find themselves in. And so that is, in fact, where we saw the biggest pullback in our business during the quarter. And I think it is, in fact, a direct reflection of where our clients, especially the CPG clients in North America, find themselves right now. And I would remind you, as Jamere mentioned earlier, that is where we see the Insights pullback, North America. Because the Insights business performed well for us in almost all other parts of the world, especially in the emerging markets. But it really is contained almost exclusively to North America, U.S, CPG clients, where they find themselves in the down part of the cycle right now.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then, turning back to Digital Content Ratings. Are the content providers paying for DCR? And once they opt in, is it essentially a subscription? I'm just wondering -- I know it's early, but I'm wondering what the visibility will look like over time, if they can kind of turn it on and off easily.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, both the advertiser and agency side as well as the publisher side will be clients of this service. And yes, the model that we are pursuing is one that -- it will be a subscription model. And not to say that, that's necessarily where everybody will begin, but that's what will make the most sense for the marketplace, in my judgment going forward. And so that's the way I would expect. As far as turning it off, turning it on, I guess, I would go back to the idea of it being so complementary to OCR and that it helps you plan and predict the OCR outcomes more confidently. Once clients start to see that value, that benefit, then I think they're going to have both of these capabilities in front of them on a continuous basis. It'll just make the most sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I'd like to follow up again on this question of the ratings and maybe ask a couple of previous questions in a maybe more direct way, which is -- with some of the issues that have come about with TV ratings and with the kind of slow ramp, it seems to me, of digital ratings, can you do something to get your C7 and OCR systems more firmly established as new standards in the market, i.e. I understand C7 was used by some broadcasters to some extent to make upfront guarantees? I'm not -- I think OCR was used for upfront guarantees on digital fronts as well. I'd like some clarification on that. But it seems like they are not being fully established enough yet to really move the ad markets. So I wonder if there's anything you can do to actually get those in place. Or is that something you have to leave to the agencies and to the markets to decide?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, yes. Thanks for the questions, Tim. Let me take them one at a time. So first, C7, and then I'll comment on the OCR. With C7, what I would remind everybody is we've been providing C7, along with C3, for quite some time in the market. So the market had converged around C3 several years ago as the primary metric, the currency for the TV ratings market. And then, it's been in recent years that some of the players have started to advocate for C7 as the better alternative to C3. But we provided both of them to the market. So we will continue to do that so that they have that choice available. And the other thing we'll do to help the market work itself through that choice is we'll provide them data about time shifting, what percent of households time shift, how much additional viewing is captured, if it's a C7 metric versus a C3 metric, so make sure the market has all the right facts so that the market can choose for itself and decide for itself, reach its own consensus and best consensus about which is the best metric to trade on. And as you mentioned, some players are already shifting to the C7 metric, but some are still holding more closely to C3. That's not a decision we make. That's a decision the market makes for itself, and we just enable the choice for them to be available. And then, with respect to OCR, yes, back to your point about were there guarantees made in the upfronts based on OCR and the new fronts, for that matter, the answer to that is definitely yes. How broad based? It's not to every single corner of the market yet, but I think we'll see that progression continue very steadily, very quickly, year-on-year, as we continue to go through the cycle. So again, we love the progression and the momentum that OCR is demonstrating in the marketplace, and that's just yet another example of it.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","So is it a matter of kind of just letting the market evolve, because there's been such a sharp move in some of the ratings, especially this year, and digital, I think everyone recognizes is so important, whether it's for Google or for CBS or whoever. There's no governing force in the industry that says we will adopt this now. Is there any way that you can force that upon the industry? No, force is a wrong word. Any way you can get the industry to adopt this more actively now?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, we're not passive. I wouldn't want you to think that, but we are neutral, and that is very important to the role that we play in the market, independent, third-party measurement. That's always been our calling card, always will be. But that doesn't mean we're passive. And again, that's why we had to -- we take the role of providing choice and then providing facts around those choices so the market can make the best possible evaluation and decide where it wants to go. But I wouldn't want you to think that we're sitting back and playing the passive role. But it needs to be neutral for us to be able to continue to use or to deserve our label as being the independent measurement provider.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question is on the high-resolution offering, more set-top box data. I know you mentioned potentially offering a second track. I was just wondering if you can maybe help us understand the timing of when you would hope to get that into the marketplace, help us to understand maybe why you would offer it separately as opposed to fully integrate it with your existing rating. Is that simply a matter of stability given the market options? Or are there some technical or commercial reasons why you would need to keep it separate?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question, Andre. This one is a little -- first, let me just go back to the idea of local audience measurement and reiterate how important this part of the market is to us and that we continue to invest in improving our measurement capabilities. And we're fully committed to remain as the currency provider. And a big part of these 2 tracks is to -- is focused just on that. So first one is about increasing the panel sizes and then adding electronic measurement to more markets. And that is for the audience measurement currency ratings that the market continues to trade on. The second track, as you mentioned, will leverage data from those same panels, but it will also blend with that data, data from other sources, including set-top box data. And that is -- that will become more of sort of a hybrid metric, is the way I would encourage you to think about it. In other words, it will have the best of both worlds. It will have the quality and representativity and person-level demographics that our panels deliver that set-top box data does not deliver. But then it will have the granularity that set-top box data can offer. And by putting those 2 together, along with some other data sources and adding some smart analytics on top of it, will give clients that second data stream that they can use to maybe better slice and dice, parse the marketplace into finer chunks so that they can think about who they're either trying to sell access to from an audience perspective or who they're trying to buy access to from an advertising perspective. And then yes, and hopefully, the clients will find that to be very, very helpful. We already have some services like that, that we're offering to the market. For instance, there's something called Local Buyer Reach that we launched a few quarters ago that a number of clients have found to be very helpful. Again, in aiding the ad sales process, if you're a local broadcaster. And so this second track is yet another capability that we're bringing for much that same reason. Now you might ask why aren't we putting it, the set-top box data in particular, directly into the currency ratings. And it's because -- there are number of reasons. But probably, the biggest one of all is because it's difficult to offer -- in fact, almost impossible, still, to offer overnight ratings based on set-top box data. And we actually presented that option to our clients. We can integrate the set-top box data into the Audience Measurement data with our panels. But you would have to pull back from having overnights. And the client said, \"No way.\" So all right, we listened to our clients. We operated on their behalf, and that's where we are today.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's all very helpful. And I guess, a simple follow-up on the Insights business. Given some of the softness and -- in the areas that you've described that people are likely to pull back within the 12% total growth, I think the last time you gave detailed guidance on Insights was at the Analyst Day last year. Should we simply be tagging to that low end of 4% to 6%? Is that still the right area? Or could that specific segment, other than this, may be even a little softer than that?","Jamere Jackson","You should be thinking about Insights at the low end of the business. Again, as Mitch said, this is the lumpier piece of our business where we saw the tightening was in the most discretionary, shortest-cycle aspect of that business. But given where we are to date, targeting at the lower end is probably the right zip code.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Adrienne Colby for Paul Ginocchio. I was hoping you could update us on how Europe is performing versus your expectations.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, Europe is performing largely in line with what our expectations have been for the last couple of years. We said it's going to be in the minus 1 to plus 1 range, and that's where it's tracking to for the year. Our teams are executing well and we have pockets of success. But still, you've seen the press as well as we have. The market is still a challenging environment.","Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And as a quick follow-up on the local TV ratings. I know that last quarter, you talked about plans to increase sample sizes in 46 markets. I was wondering if you could address how many additional markets you're looking to make those increases and what percent of your total local markets that would represent.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, thanks. What we're looking to do is increase sample sizes in '14 of our local people meter markets, that's 14 out of 25, and then increase sample sizes in 31 of our set meter markets. Those are also electronically measured. That's all of our set meter markets. And then we're adding electronic measurement to 14 of our current -- 14 of the markets that are currently still measured by the paper diaries. So that's in total what that part of our program is all about. As far as what percent of our business that represents, while that is, what is that, 28 and it's about 59 markets in total out of 210 DMAs, but it is -- those are the disproportionately larger markets. And so I'm going to give you a ballpark here of maybe 75%, 80% of our total revenues represented by just those markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Robert W. Baird.","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Just with the recent over-the-top announcements, including the HBO and CBS, could you guys talk about your non-ad-supported business, video business? How big of that is that for you currently? And what are the trends that you're seeing?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, these announcements from CBS and HBO about their apps that are coming out to the marketplace, these are exciting developments for the market and certainly exciting for the consumer. And they also really highlight the strength of our strategy, which is to always focus on the consumer, measure the consumer, wherever they are viewing video content, across any screen, across any platform. And so when these new apps become available to consumers and they start watching TV content through them, we'll be measuring it, and that will be largely by leveraging our OCR measurement methodology and our mobile measurement that we've talked about earlier. The -- I'm sorry, the other part of your question was?","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. That was most of it, just hitting on the trends and how big of a business that is for you. I guess, just one quick follow-up. We've been getting a lot of questions on the on-demand video consumption. We were under the impression that you guys had that capability and that was being incorporated. But just given the questions -- if you could provide added color around what you're currently measuring and also monetizing with VOD?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, VOD. Again, starting with the consumer, we go wherever they're going to be viewing content, and video-on-demand is one of the growing areas. We've had a capability in the market for some time. And in fact, we've been investing in that capability to measure viewing through video-on-demand. And we launched an upgrade to that capability just last month. And our capability in the market now allows us to measure and report viewing of video-on-demand content and get C3 credit for it for not only the most recently aired episode, but also previous episodes of the same season or even previous episodes of a prior season, as long as they could carry the same commercial load as the most recently aired telecast. And so you're going to see more and more of our clients embrace that monetization model. And yes, that's the measurement capability we have for the marketplace right now, focused on video-on-demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Toni for Suzi. Just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the Adobe partnership. It sounds like a strong step forward for OCR in terms of being able to reach a significant amount of web content without having to make the investment yourself. So does that mean that you'll be able to lighten your investment in OCR or that the investment in OCR might end earlier than originally planned? And so basically, what are the long-term implications for margin expansion in Watch from this?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","We'll continue to invest in OCR and Digital Content Ratings and all of the associated products in this overall Audience Measurement suite. And the reason why we'll continue to invest is because, as you've seen, this market doesn't stand still. So while we might have all of the major needs that the market's looking for right now addressed with measurement solutions, they'll be new ones coming out. And we also know that the market still has a need and an opportunity to put these pieces together, to harmonize them, so that they see that complete cross-platform view of the market, and that will increasingly be a focus of ours in the months ahead.","Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then one follow-up. The -- given the large share repurchase authorization, how do you view your future M&A appetite? Is that reduced? Or what is your strategy around that?","Jamere Jackson","So given what we've talked about on the share repurchase plan, this still gives us tremendous flexibility to, number one, grow our business organically and inorganically. And you will continue to see us have a balanced capital allocation approach, which is focused on having a growing dividend, toggling between buyback opportunities and M&A. And with our strong balance sheet and our great free cash flow generation capabilities, we're going to be able to continue to do that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weiser from Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","On the Adobe news, I was wondering if you could talk through some of the elements of the timing of the launched key milestones to come. And maybe, most practically, if you have a sense of when you expect that agencies might be signed up and begin using the tool. And I'll throw my follow-up out there now as well, or my second question. So recognizing that very little TV or buying in general might be characterized as really fully data-driven, automated\/programmatic, do you have a sense of how much of your data or how commonly your data is being used in programmatic TV? I know you referenced the Local Buyer Reach product, which MAGNA and WideOrbit announced they would be using. But I was just curious if you have seen it, your data, more broadly, at all being used maybe at the national level, where there are attempts to drive programmatic buying in TV?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, Brian. Thanks for the question. On the first one, for Digital Content Ratings, as far as the timing is, we just announced it to the marketplace 2 days ago, right? So we're in the process now of working with those major clients, the ones who want to be the first to sign on. They start to plan that timing rollout. And so we'll have more to say on that in the near future. There's not a lot of detail that we can offer to you now, but you can be sure that'll include not only the big media conglomerates and the big digital publishing, but also the agencies who are a very important part of this mix, and we'll be working very closely with them. So all across the board, the participation will be broad based. And we'll make sure that not only the service, but also the way the entire system works is in such a manner that it serves the entire need of the marketplace. Second, on programmatic, I mentioned earlier about OCR. Some of the earliest adopters and biggest users of our OCR metric were from the ad tech world, and they don't all employ programmatic. But many of them do, as you know better than I. And so I think that the OCR has proven itself to be very useful to that crowd. And it's in part because even though you've taken a part of the buying process and you've automated it, i.e. programmatic, that still needs to be measured and it still needs to be improved. And the role that OCR plays for programmatic buying is just as useful as it is for any other kind of buying for that matter. And the way we deliver it, the way the metric is constructed, the granularity with which it's provided, in fact, makes it outstanding to support programmatic buying activities.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And what about in traditional TV though, where it -- again, I recognize that the bigger opportunity in programmatic is online and you are being widely used, I hear that from players in the industry all the time. But when it comes to traditional TV, where it's really nascent -- but I guess, what I'm getting at indirectly is that, where I think a lot of Rentrak's data is being used very practically is for these purposes and it's very small. But I'm just curious, if the MAGNA and WideOrbit announcement was one illustration. You obviously have more data than most people could possibly need to do any targeting. So I just wasn't sure if you're hearing of any use of whether it's NCS or other data sets to inform efforts to drive data-driven TV buying at this point.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, we are in -- you can be sure that we're in discussions with all of our big media clients. Some are more interested in this topic than others, and we're working with them very closely. So we'll be a part of that, we're sure of that, as it continues to unfold. But to your point before, it is still fairly early days for the traditional TV players on this one, but it's coming.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one question for Mitch and then one for Jamere. So Mitch, with the Adobe deal, obviously, it was a great partnership to announce. I was just curious like how we should think about how many more such marquee partnerships are potentially out there for you guys in terms of the way you're thinking about the future? I mean, obviously, without giving any names, like is there -- should we be expecting 5 to 10 marquee ones, like just a general idea of how you guys are thinking along those lines?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question, Manav. This is a part of our strategy to be open to these value-added strategic partners outside of Nielsen. And you've seen us do this a number of times in the past. You're seeing it more recently in this announcement with Adobe and, by the way, also this relationship in Japan that I mentioned on the Buy side of our business with Intage. So there's a number of other wins, too. Catalina, we have a joint venture with them. You've seen some news in recent months, recent weeks about Simulmedia, a number of others, Pointlogic, we announced that a couple of months ago. This is just part of our strategy, to take this open approach, to partner with other key third parties in order to provide the best possible solutions to the marketplace. So yes, you've seen us do it in the past. You're going to see us continue to do it. And it's because I think that is the way the world operates best, when complementary collaborators come together to give the market better solutions than it can do it on their own.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then Jamere, just a follow-up on Andre's question on Insights. I guess, you said the lower end is at 4%, I guess, organic growth for '14. Does -- so that implies that you'll see a pick back up in growth in the fourth quarter?","Jamere Jackson","So here's where we've been. So in the first quarter, we were at 4%. Second quarter was 4%. We dipped down this quarter at 4%. And again, what we saw in this quarter was the most discretionary, shorter-cycle pieces of the business. And while we don't expect there to be material improvements in North America spend environments, there is an opportunity for some of that short-cycle activity to potentially come back. But at the end of the day, we expect to be at the lower end of that range, given where we've been through the first 3 quarters of the year.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then...","Dwight Mitchell Barns","The CPG clients are in that down part of the cycle right now. That's just a reality. They're having challenge finding growth, whether it's unit sales or dollar sales for their business, but they come out of the cycle, and then you see this part of the business usually respond.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just on the margin side, on the Buy business, can you remind us sort of the parts on how that trajectory -- I mean, should that just keep showing more and more investments and having that stay flattish? Or how should we think about that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, I'll throw it to Jamere in a second, but I -- what I want to say is the way we think about margins, we really manage it at the total company level, Watch and Buy, and also where Watch connects with Buy Ad Solutions. And national scale benefits of our business model allow us to expand margins year-on-year in the range of 40 to 60 basis points while still continuing to invest back in our business. And we do that largely, of course, focused on those big 2 trends out in the marketplace, media fragmentation and then population. Population growth, movement, rise of the middle class. And the way we respond to both of those is coverage, of course, covering new markets, covering new consumers, new platforms with increasing granularity. It's a proven strategy. And you've seen that even in our Buy business as we talked about earlier with the double-digit growth, broad-based double-digit growth across our emerging markets, in the past quarter. Jamere?","Jamere Jackson","Look, what I'll add is that we've invested nearly 2 points of Buy margins back into the business to support the emerging market growth over the last 3 or 4 years. Some of the early investments are starting to scale. Hence, you see margins starting to move in the right direction. We've been vastly underpenetrated and in catch-up mode in many respects in many of these markets, and now we're investing more in line with market growth. So given these dynamics, you should continue to see margins move in the right direction.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","All, we apologize. We're out of time. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the IR team. Thank you so much for dialing in today, and we look forward to talking to you soon.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2016 Nielsen Holdings Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Yaeni Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Yaeni Kim - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's third quarter 2016 financial performance. Joining me on today's call is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, October 25, 2016.","We will be discussing non-GAAP measures during this call, for which we have provided reconciliations in the appendices of today's presentation and will be posted on our website. Our actual results in the future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in Nielsen's 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find on our IR site or at sec.gov.","As we did last quarter, we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question, only so we can accommodate everyone. Feel free to join the queue again and if time remains, we will call on you.","And now, to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Yaeni. Good morning, everyone. On last quarter's call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve and you well know, change is a source of both challenge and opportunity and we saw both in this quarter.","In our Watch business, our momentum continued with our Total Audience Measurement System. Client adoption continued to grow as Digital Content Ratings moved to syndicated reporting, Digital Ad Ratings expanded to new markets and the industry further narrowed in on a new currency definition. We also announced upgrades to our local TV measurement. So we feel great about our progress here.","For our Buy business, emerging markets continued to produce solid top line growth as our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off. But regarding developed markets, while Europe made good progress in the quarter, our U.S. results were down versus the prior year as clients looked for more efficiency and productivity in the face of an increasingly difficult growth environment.","Earlier this year as we saw these more challenging trends unfolding, we realigned our Buy business to be more focused in our product development and more efficient in our overhead. More recently as the trends continued for our clients, we stepped up our efforts to reduce our cost base, reallocate resources and accelerate our investments in initiatives that will help our clients and better position our business for the future.","We've been hard at work on these initiatives and you'll hear more about them in a few minutes but for now, let me say that our Buy business is working through a process of change that's similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business and we're confident that our Buy initiatives will produce similar results.","Let's look at the financials for the third quarter. At a total company level, revenue grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in our Watch segment increased 6.7% on a constant currency basis including an 8.5% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew just under 1% on a constant currency basis, as emerging markets growth of nearly 9% was offset by a decline in developed markets driven by the U.S.","Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% constant currency, supported by ongoing productivity and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives. Adjusted net income per share grew almost 6% constant currency to $0.74. Free cash flow was a record $353 million in the quarter, up slightly compared to a year ago.","We remain committed to driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy and we do this by investing consistently in our future growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back approximately $90 million in shares and as of September 30, we had approximately $460 million remaining under our existing authorization.","Lastly, in light of our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our guidance for the full year and Jamere will provide detail on this in a few minutes.","Let's look at the segments. First, Watch. If we turn back the clock a bit, it was just a few years ago when the market was still thinking of Nielson as the television measurement company. As viewing fragmented across screens and digital platforms, we responded with measurement capabilities that followed the consumer. Over time, this developed into what we know today as our Total Audience Measurement system.","The progress we've made is reflected in our Watch business performance, but it didn't happen overnight. It's been a multi-year evolution and our teams have diligently executed on each step bringing this whole framework to life and while we've made very good progress, we continue to work alongside our clients every day, adding new features as clients explore all potential use cases for the data. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Nielsen.","Let's look at some specific highlights from the quarter. In September, Digital Content Ratings became available in full syndication on schedule, this was a tremendous milestone. Publishers, agencies and advertisers are now equipped with powerful daily data that helps them understand the value of content across digital platforms. Adoption is growing daily.","For Total Content Ratings, at the direct request of our clients, we made some changes to our original release schedule. The initial step of this schedule occurred on August 1, making Total Content Ratings available on a syndicated basis to all participating publishers. We'll broaden that to include agencies at the start of 2017, before making the data available to the entire industry by the end of the first quarter. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our clients to help them gain comfort with the comparable metrics in advance of full syndication.","Just a reminder, total content ratings includes measurement of subscription video on-demand, now covering over 15,000 different program episodes, nearly double the number from about six months ago.","On Digital Ad Ratings, we continue to grow and expand. Campaigns in the third quarter were up 45%, reflecting growing volumes with existing large clients as well as very strong adoption from new smaller advertisers. Across the board, we're seeing growing use of Digital Ad Ratings for guarantees.","We've also made good progress with Digital Ad Ratings internationally. For example, in Canada, our penetration among the top 25 advertisers is now comparable to the U.S. We also recently announced Digital Ad Ratings in Taiwan, our 24th market. In 2017, we'll add eight to 10 additional markets and we'll also upgrade some existing markets to include total ad ratings.","Overall, client adoption and support of our Total Audience Measurement system is steadily growing. As we look out to 2017, our clients remain highly engaged in the effort to move the industry toward a new ratings standard. While the definition of a new currency is not up for Nielsen alone to decide, we're confident that with the clarity and momentum we built with Total Audience Measurement, it will play an important role in the 2017 upfronts.","In local TV, we recently announced some important new initiatives that will substantially enhance our offerings in the U.S. by leveraging our investments in return path data from DISH and Charter, as well as our currency grade panel data. We'll introduce full electronic measurement across all 210 designated market areas by mid-2017, paving the way for the retirement of paper diaries in early 2018.","Starting in 2017, we'll also integrate Portable People Meter or PPM data, for both in home and out of home viewing in the top 44 markets. This will lead to increased stability, a decrease in zero cells, and richer analytics of local viewing habits. By including out of home viewing in the ratings, we'll help our local TV clients more fully capture the value of this portion of the TV audience that was previously unmeasured. And by the way, just yesterday, we announced to our clients that out of home viewing will also soon be credited to the national ratings.","We also recently upgraded social content ratings, now covering both Facebook and Twitter in a unified fashion. This upgraded service will replace Nielsen Twitter TV ratings in all markets, including Australia, Italy, Mexico and the U.S. With social media playing a growing role in consumers' lives and TV experiences, its value for the media industry will also continue to grow.","Turning to Marketing Effectiveness, we had another strong quarter with constant currency revenues up over 30%. As a reminder, this is the part of our business where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets, to help marketers improve their return on investment in advertising. A large part of this is enabled by the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, which provides our clients with faster access to data and analytics, helping them make more informed marketing and media decisions.","One recent example of this is our advanced marketing optimization solution made available in partnership with RevTrax, a one-to-one digital promotions company. Kimberly-Clark is one of the lead clients leveraging this new application to continuously update their promotions content, based on real-time changes in consumer behavior, all with a name of increasing the ROI of their digital promotions.","Also notable is Nielsen Catalina's recently announced collaboration with Facebook. This deal enables marketers to directly connect their advertising activity to its impact on sales, as well as deliver more relevant advertising to targeted consumers. By combining the largest, most representative purchase data set in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, with ad exposure information from Facebook, we get a deep understanding of how these ads are driving consumers to purchase.","Turning to the Buy business, in emerging markets, our business continues to deliver solid broad-based growth, including double-digit growth across several key markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and India.","As a group, these markets still have a lot of runway for continued growth via added coverage, granularity and increasing penetration of the related analytics that help our clients to drive progress in their business. Our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off.","In developed markets, specifically the U.S., the environment in which we operate has become more challenging. Large global manufacturers are the strength of our client base. And as I'm sure you've seen in the recent press, they found it increasingly difficult to achieve growth in markets with growing fragmentation in consumer demand, more competition from smaller and local players and increased commodity pricing.","Together, these factors have led them to seek efficiencies in productivity in their business and our business has not been immune. Our clients continue to value our core measurement services, especially given the growing product and retail fragmentation in the market. But, when it comes to analytics, their needs have been shifting, clients are shifting away from custom insights delivered via deep-dive projects, and they are shifting toward every day analytics, often called activation, delivered directly to multiple end users.","Our view is that this is a secular shift, not a passing phase or a cycle that will swing back. Clients want analytics that will help them answer the question of what do I need to do this week or tomorrow or even today to drive sales, protect market share or improve my competitive position. In today's challenging growth environment, that's what's most valuable to them.","Now let me walk you through what we are doing to respond to this. First, you will see us aggressively moving away from slower growing non-core services. These moves are enabling us to accelerate and increase our investments in our key initiatives that will better position our business for the future.","The most important of these initiatives are Total Consumer Measurement and our Connected System. Total Consumer Measurement is about following consumers across all retail formats to ensure full coverage of sales. In a changing and fragmenting retail environment, this requires ongoing effort to help our clients understand emerging channels like specialty retailers, hard discounters, direct-to-consumer models and of course, e-commerce.","Speaking of e-commerce, we've made good progress on our hybrid solution announced earlier this year. It combines high quality panels with big data to provide broad and granular coverage of e-commerce sales including on the largest platforms.","Our second initiative, our Connected System, is the bigger of the two. This open system connects Nielsen, client and third-party data including our core Watch and Buy measurement data with applications designed for decision makers in our clients' marketing, sales, R&D and finance functions.","This means faster data-driven decisions on everyday questions related to pricing, promotion, distribution, new product innovation, assortment and marketing mix optimization, all in one Connected System. And this is the key, because many of these capabilities already exist as standalone point solutions. By connecting them all in one system, one that delivers these capabilities continuously, every day and directly to end users, that's what will help our clients reduce their internal costs, while also driving a big step-up in value and speed for their business. And just as importantly, it will significantly reduce cost and improve margins for Nielsen.","Since we first talked with you about the Connected System at our Analyst Day last December, we've been hard at work. Today it's in the hands of five initial clients, who are working with us to refine the system's design. We've also demonstrated live modules for our Client Advisory Board and others. And the positive feedback from our clients, coupled with the changes we see unfolding in the market have encouraged us to accelerate our development schedule and investments. We'll expand the availability of the system to 20 to 30 additional clients in mid-2017, followed by a further rollout late in the year.","And as that rollout unfolds, you'll also see the ongoing development of our Connected Partner program that we announced last week. Connected Partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps and those apps run on our Connected System's open platform providing more usefulness and value for our clients. These apps amplify the value of the underlying measurement data that is the core of our business. A recent Forbes article referred to this as Nielsen opening its big data treasure chest. We'll go into a deep dive on all this at our upcoming Analyst Day in December.","Regarding the timeline, one way to think about this is that our Buy business is working through a process similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business. We'll work through most of 2017 bringing additional components of the Connected System to market. It will likely not be until 2018 until a fuller version begins to contribute meaningfully to the performance of our Buy business.","Through this process, we're truly transforming the core of our Buy business. Comprehensive measurement coverage, integrated data and analytics, embedded in our clients' workloads with data as a service and software as a service solutions directly accessed by our clients' teams in marketing, sales, R&D and finance and for Nielsen, a stronger, higher margin business, better positioned for the future.","It's important to note that these benefits will reach beyond our U.S. business. We'll leverage this system across the developed world on roughly the same schedule, and longer-term it will also add value to our business in key emerging markets. In the meantime, we'll continue to realign our cost base, prune our portfolio and reallocate resources to enable us to accelerate our progress and better position this part of our business for the future.","We have a lot of work to do, but it's exciting and because we're guided by our clients, we have a high-level of confidence in our strategy and the key bets we're placing. And because I know the Nielsen team behind this work I have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute.","We look forward to updating you at our Analyst Day in December.","Over to you, Jamere.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Mitch. Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio.","First, let me cover our total company results for the third quarter. On the left side of the page, our results on a U.S. GAAP basis, revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment, partially offset by softness in the developed markets in our Buy segment.","Net income was $132 million and net income per share was $0.36 which was down $0.02 a share versus the third quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program offset by higher restructuring charges related to further restructuring in our Buy segment.","Moving to the right side of the page on a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. Despite a more challenging environment, we still delivered revenue growth driven by strength in our subscription base recurring revenue and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.7% on a constant currency basis driven by our investments, continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness.","Our Buy business grew just under 1% constant currency led by continued strength in the emerging markets which was partially offset by a decline in the developed markets. Adjusted EBITDA was $498 million, up 4% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%, up 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. In the quarter, we continued disciplined investments in growth and productivity initiatives that will generate top line growth and margin expansion in 2017 and beyond.","Adjusted net income was $266 million, up 3.1% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.74, up 5.7% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our stock share buyback program. Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $353 million which was up 2% versus a strong third quarter in 2015.","Next I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $761 million, up 6.7% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well, as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As expected, Audio was down 2.8% on a constant currency basis against a tough comp in 3Q 2015 that grew 11% driven by timing of deliveries. The business is performing in line with our expectations and generating strong earnings and cash flow.","Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.8% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Repucom, which is now branded as Nielson Sports. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth and we continue to see strong demand from a broad array of clients.","As expected, Other Watch was about a 2 points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Watch margins expanded 33 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business.","Let me say a few words about a couple our key initiatives in Watch. First Total Audience has strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings has been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. In the third quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 45%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We have added nearly 100 new Digital Ad Ratings clients this year and experienced strong renewals with good pricing from existing clients.","Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, DCR was fully syndicated and we continue to add networks and digital players to an already strong roster of previously signed clients. In fact, we have over 90 brands being measured in DCR, and syndicated clients include; A&E, ABC, AOL, Buzzfeed, Discovery and Vice among many others. Digital Content Ratings is a key piece of our Total Audience capabilities and will be a future growth driver for our business.","Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.","Turning to Buy, Third quarter total Buy revenue was $809 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis. On a total segment basis, our syndicated recurring revenue business remains solid. However, our ad hoc discretionary revenue declined. Our business in the developed markets was $542 million, down 2.5% on a constant currency basis as we continue to see softness in discretionary spend, especially in the U.S. Additionally, we are taking steps to future proof our business by pruning and sun setting slow growth non-core services in developed markets. These actions along with further restructuring in our Buy segment and accelerating the development of our Connected System will strengthen our business.","As you've often heard me say, we are clearly operating in a two speed world with significantly higher growth rates in the emerging markets versus developed markets. In the third quarter, our business in the emerging markets was $267 million up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As Mitch mentioned, growth was broad based across a number of markets. In addition, we saw double-digit growth from multinationals that gives us more confidence that emerging markets will continue to be a tailwind for our Buy segment revenue into 2017.","Buy EBITDA was $150 million, down 3.8% constant currency. In this environment, we continue to invest in a disciplined way in coverage and building out the Connected System, which will drive future growth and profitability in our Buy business. The early read from our initial pilot clients is promising and we are confident that our investment will further strengthen our competitive position.","These key investments along with an unfavorable mix between our developed and emerging markets revenue are the key drivers for Buy adjusted EBITDA margins being down 91 basis points versus the prior year. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we now expect our Buy revenues to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2016.","Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in 110 basis points drag on revenue, if current spot rates held constant through 2016, then we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and a 70 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is in line with the forecast we gave last quarter.","Moving to 2016 guidance, in light of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we are updating our full year guidance highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 30 basis points, adjusted net income per share of $2.73 to $2.79 and free cash flow of approximately $850 million.","So, to wrap up, our third quarter was highlighted by revenue growth and margin expansion in a more challenging environment. First, our Watch business has tremendous momentum behind our Total Audience initiatives and by our subscription base recurring revenue business remaining solid and emerging market growth remains robust, while our developed market business in the U.S. has declined. But importantly, across both Watch and Buy, we continue to invest in a disciplined way to build a stronger, higher margin business. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividend and buybacks.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Yaeni.","Yaeni Kim - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, operator. We'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hi, Toni.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Buy growth in developed markets I guess was the lowest since you've started reporting it as a sub-segment and clearly driven by this \u2013 the insights piece. So, you've mentioned the secular shift away from custom insights to everyday analytics. And so, I was hoping you could give a little more color on the drivers behind sort of the reduced spending, are you losing share, is the competitive environment changing or are customers just tightening budgets? And is there any way to quantify that and basically in terms of the investments that you're going to be making in Buy to address the shift? How much should this impact Buy margins? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Toni. Let me start and I'm sure Jamere will add. First, with regard to Buy developed, yeah, that is the challenging spot for our business in the quarter. But, I would even narrow it further for you, because within Buy developed, Europe grew, the Pacific grew, Canada grew, it's really the U.S. where the problem is focused at the moment.","And so, just to sharpen the focus a little bit, focus on the U.S. What we're seeing in the U.S. market \u2013 let me give you a couple of examples in terms of the external environment that our clients are dealing with. First, if you just focus in on food and beverage manufacturers, 2015, we saw this trend starting to emerge where the small and medium sized manufacturers accounted for about half of the growth in the categories. And, private label accounted for about a quarter of the growth and the big \u2013 the top 25 players, they accounted collectively for only 3% of the growth in food and beverage categories in 2015. And that situation really hasn't changed that much in 2016. The reason why that's especially noteworthy for our business is the strength of our business just so happens to be the biggest global companies, the biggest global players. And so, you see that reflected in our U.S. results.","What all these companies are dealing with, both food and beverage and others, is a combination of things. Product fragmentation where consumers are increasingly shifting their purchasing to smaller specialty, more niche products, moving away a little bit from the bigger brands. You see retail fragmentations of purchases moving across additional channels. You of course, see the 3G effect sweeping through the fast moving consumer goods industry where companies, whether 3G is a factor or not are practicing zero-based budgeting, they're running their own internal 3G play. And, they add up all these things together and that's the situation that our clients are contending with and you see that reflected back in our results.","Now for us, what that means in terms of their discretionary spend, as I said, they're shifting from these more deep dive projects that help them think about what they're going to do next year and focused much more on these everyday analytics that help them with activation. What should I do today or tomorrow or this week and that's where the shift is happening in the marketplace.","And so we're realigning our portfolio to better serve those client interests and those client needs. And as I mentioned, we don't see this as just a passing phase that the marketplace is going through. We see this as a trend that will continue on more of a secular basis over the long run.","As we make this shift and as we build out this Connected System, you see us building a very different business really frankly. Right now, it's very much a professional services model for Nielsen, as that Connected System starts to unfold in the marketplace, it helps us to move from a professional service or people as a service business model to much more as a data as a service and software as a service business model. And that all results in us, as Jamere said in his opening comments, having a stronger higher margin business. Jamere, what would you add?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, just a couple things on margin. So you did see our margins dip in the quarter. I would say the key drivers as I said in my comments were there's a bit of a mix issue as emerging markets revenue grew 8.5% and the higher margin developed markets revenue actually declined.","I'd say the second thing as Mitch said, we're continuing to invest in the Connected System and our Total Consumer initiatives to future proof the business and so, in the short-term, with a softer revenue profile, this obviously puts pressure on margins.","But in terms of our long-term productivity drivers, I would say three things. One is, we're continuing to see scale benefits in the emerging markets and there's a focus on profitability. We're running the place with intensity around cost and productivity. I've mentioned before that we have over 4,000 projects that are running inside the company. We're invested in our products, our higher margin products. And I'd say the last thing is you've seen us take a couple of rounds of restructuring in the second quarter and the third quarter to put us on the right trajectory going forward.","So, we have confidence again that we will expand margins on a total company basis and we're running all the right plays inside the company to be able to achieve that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Probably unsurprisingly, I'll use my one question to dive a little further back into this topic again if you don't mind. Let me take a shot at seeing if you'll comment anything to help us size this a little bit. When you used to disclose the insights line item or analytics line item in the Buy segment, I think the last time you did that was 2014. And at that point in time, I think it was about 25% of Buy segment revenue.","So, I guess a question is, is that \u2013 any reason to think that it's not sort of similar to that today? Any comment you'd make on sort of the relative margin profile of that part of the business compared to the segment overall margin profile? And then, as we think about what part of it is at risk, can you help us through, is all of that revenue pull at risk, is some at risk, as you transition to replacing it with this other shape of revenue and just helping us size it in that way, whatever you'd help us, say, would be really helpful. Thank you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Todd. So, in terms of the size of what I will call our analytics or discretionary business, it is probably in the 30%-ish kind of range in terms of our total portfolio, sometimes a little bit more, a little bit less on a quarter-to-quarter basis, just depending on what the project pipeline is.","I would say a couple of things, first of all from a \u2013 in terms of what the focus area is in our portfolio, there is probably 3% to 4% in the Buy revenue, that as Mitch mentioned is slow growing or becoming non-core, and just a couple of examples if you look at a year ago, we would provide the data and analytics for things like helping retailers optimize store locations, in a world were bricks-and-mortar is under pressure and e-commerce is actually growing, we were providing data and analytics around video sales and retail channels in an environment where consumers are moving to more streaming digital consumption, providing data and analytics around alcoholic beverages moving through wholesaler channels. So these are some examples of a very broad portfolio in Buy.","And as we look at our resource allocation as we look at the discretionary nature of some of those data sets and those analytics, we're actually going to move away from some of those. So, it's 3% to 4% of the portfolio, and we're going to be aggressive about that, and replace that with things that are more future-proof and things that are actually in our Connected Buy system platform if you will.","In terms of the margin profile, the analytics or ad-hoc or discretionary projects have tended to be a lower margin profile than the overall business and so as we think about moving forward in our future to a Connected Buy system that is much more data-as-a-service or people as a service-oriented then the margin profile will certainly improve overall for the Buy business, so...","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","What I'll add to that, Todd, is when we look at all the different analytics in, as you describe them, insights-type capabilities we have in our portfolio, some of them are still doing incredibly well. And, we see a pattern in terms of which parts are performing better versus which ones are struggling in the current environment.","And, here is the characteristics of the things that are doing well. If the analytics capability is connected to our core measurement data, that's a positive. Second, if data is more focused on activation or these everyday analytics kinds of questions, that's a positive. And, third, if the talent required in that analytics area is similar to the talent that helps us be successful in our core measurement business, that also tends to do better within the Nielsen portfolio. So, we have a number of analytics capabilities that perfectly fit that profile. And, no surprise, those are the parts that are performing really well.","And then, we have a number of others that don't fit that profile and those are the ones where we have some decisions to make. And, we've already started to take those decisions as Jamere recounted.","One other thing I'll add to this picture, which I hope will be helpful, Todd, is why \u2013 you might be wondering, why is it showing up more in the U.S. than it is in other places? Well, fact is the U.S. revenues, a bigger percentage of our U.S. revenues are these discretionary services. In fact, there's about twice as much \u2013 slightly more than twice as much of our U.S. revenues come from these discretionary services as compared to Europe where it's a much smaller percentage. So that's why you see it showing up in the U.S. and that's why our focus is currently centered on the U.S. but we're transforming our Buy portfolio really for the entire developed market world and ultimately a lot of these moves that we're making, in particular with the Connected System, will benefit our business in the key emerging markets as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Yes. Thanks. Just one more on this topic I guess. You talked about for Connected Buy kind of the timeline, but I guess what pace do you \u2013 or how long will it take to kind of make this transition in the areas where just kind of moving away from the business over time. I guess, how long will this be a headwind, how quickly do you want to kind of move away from those areas?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","The last thing we want to do is set expectations too aggressively. The timeline I described in my opening comments, I think is exactly the right way to think about it, which is \u2013 well, first of all, let me start with, we already have an initial version of this system built and in the hands of five initial clients. So I want you to just realize that this is real and it's something we've been working on now for the better part of a year, and even before our Analyst Day last December when we first talked about this with our investors and analysts.","We already have it in the hands of five initial clients. We have live modules that are already usable. We've demonstrated those for our clients and we have great feedback so far. In fact, our clients are already thinking through what it's going to mean in terms of implementation on their side, that's the kind of reaction we've received so far.","We'll roll it out to 20 to 30 additional clients by the middle of 2017, and by the end of the year is when we think we'll be prepared for a more full rollout to all clients who want to start to make the shift to transition to this Connected System. So, we're certainly hopeful that it'll start to have some impact on our business in 2017, but I think the better way to think about it is it'll start to show up meaningfully, significantly in our business, especially the financial results, in the 2018 timeframe.","But one other thing to add to that, just to put maybe a reference point on that, I mentioned in my opening comments that I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. While it's a slightly different system that we're building and a slightly different set of client needs that we're addressing. The magnitude of this and the execution required to do it properly, to do it in a way that really fits with what our clients need is very similar to what you've seen us work successfully through on the Watch side of our business as we developed a Total Audience Measurement framework, and roll that out to our clients over the past couple of years. So look, we know how to do this, we have the teams in place and they're very focused and excited about the task in front of them, and we have a huge opportunity to drive this stronger higher margin business for our future to take cost out of our clients' business, on their side of the table and to give them a lot more value and a lot more speed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. So I just wanted to, I guess again touch on Buy here, but in terms of the sequential changes you've seen because the revenue backdrop you described doesn't seem that new. The margin investments in Connected and the total Buy system or whatever, that isn't new as well. So Q-over-Q what really changed, especially since I think you maybe just said the analytics side of it was lower margin, so I would assume you would have the flex to sort of offset that. So I'm just a little confused quite honestly on what changed over the quarter?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So, a couple things. First of all, if you're looking back to the third quarter of last year, you saw our developed markets business grow 4.8% constant currency and as part of that discussion we've said that we saw a pretty strong discretionary environment. We have not seen that since then and if you look at our results in our developed Buy business they've sequentially been going in the other direction and part of that is because that stable or I would say the environment in the third quarter last year actually ran a little hot. I would say that environment has slowly started to erode and we're starting to see the dynamics that Mitch and I have discussed in the call today.","From a margin standpoint, again, you have a couple of dynamics there. One is, you have sort of a mix shift between our developed markets revenue and our emerging markets revenue that certainly plays into the numbers. And then the second thing, as I said is, we'll continue to invest in our growth initiatives in a softer revenue environment is going to fuel that margin pressure.","But more importantly, we've taken the actions, if you will, that will put us on the right trajectory from a cost standpoint. First of all, as I said, a couple of rounds of restructuring that you saw in the second quarter and the third quarter numbers. We'll continue to work on our productivity initiatives, we're investing in and actually emphasizing the faster growing, higher margin pieces of the Buy portfolio. And so, we have a lot of confidence around that story and what that will mean for us going forward.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","And, what I'll add to that, Manav, is that you're right, it's not new. But we've always viewed this part of the business as lumpy. And so, some quarters up, some quarters down. I think what it comes down to is, we're just not thinking of it so much that way. This \u2013 some of these characteristics we're not viewing as lumpiness, we're as I said seeing them more as secular shifts. And so, we just reached the conclusion that it's not viable for the long-term to keep running after these short-term revenue opportunities and keep trying to chase these and work our way through the lumpy nature of this part of our business.","Instead, a much better future is about investing in something that transforms our product portfolio. That takes some of the lumpiness out of this part of our business that better fits with what our clients need and where their needs are evolving toward. And, that's what that Connected System is designed to do.","And so, we're not running after those short-term revenue opportunities as much in the quarter and that will continue going forward. And that allows us to reallocate, enables us to reallocate resources to build faster and do more as we develop this Connected System initiative. So you see all of that reflected in the results in the quarter and our outlook going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kip Paulson from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Kip Paulson - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple for me. Starting with Watch, Marketing Effectiveness growth picked up nicely in the quarter. How much of this was driven by Marketing and Cloud or eXelate versus Nielsen Catalina? And could you give us a sense of how fast Marketing Cloud is growing? I believe eXelate was growing at a roughly 40% clip a couple of quarters ago?","And then second if I could, how much of the $100 million of reduction in the free cash flow guidance would you attribute to underperformance in developed Buy versus increased investments? Thank you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks. So just to give you a little bit of color on our Marketing Effectiveness business is up 31.8% in the quarter. As you know, we did have a couple of inorganic things in there with Nielsen Sports and Nielsen Catalina Solutions that had us growing probably closer to an 18% organic number. The things that we're really excited about in Marketing Effectiveness, first of all is Nielsen Marketing Cloud or eXelate, it's up double-digits. Nielsen Buyer Insights is up double-digits as clients continue to look for our data sets to help them build ROI solutions. And Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up about 18% organically as well. So, we continue to be impressed with the growth that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness and it's provided a nice tailwind for our business.","In terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year. So just a couple things. One is as you alluded to, most of the sort of revenue shortfall actually was in our Buy business and so that's a big driver of it. So you get a couple of things rolling through the numbers. One is, just a reduced EBITDA outlook, particularly for the developed Buy regions. The second thing is that we're continuing to invest and actually our investment profile is slightly higher than what we began at the beginning of the year and that is both a Watch and a Buy story. So on the Watch side you've seen us acquire and begin to integrate set-top box data for all the things that we're doing with our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. We've talked about moving away from the paper diaries and bringing more electronic measurement to the marketplace, that's certainly rolling through the numbers, and then, we have a big year in front of us in terms of bringing DCR and DAR to the marketplace and growing that piece of the business.","And then, the last piece is growing the investment profile associated with our Connected System and our Total Consumer initiative. So combination of lower EBITDA expectations and a slightly higher investment profile were some of the key growth initiatives in the future is driving it.","And then one other thing I'd add to that is, we're probably going to be at the upper-end of what we gave as sort of a cash restructuring number and that's focused on the fact that in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've taken a couple actions in our Buy business to set us on the right trajectory for the future. So, those are the things that are driving the number from a free cash flow standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the grand total of organic growth for the quarter, just to try to dimensionalize that? And maybe relatedly, was there any contribution on the organic side from DCR and TCR to revenue in the quarter?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So from an organic standpoint, we had about 1.5%, just a little under 1.5% of revenue contribution with the combination of Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Nielsen Sports or Repucom offset by NRG. So, those are the numbers from an organic standpoint.","And then, the second part of your question was around...?","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Contribution from DAR?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","From DAR or DCR, so from TCR and DCR still early innings there, we've had the syndication's just taken place as you know, we've had a number of clients looking at the data for a while, so the revenue contribution is immaterial in the quarter and it's again, I expect that to be a much greater contributor in 2017 and going forward.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","But, I'll also say though, as we've said in the past, Digital Ad Ratings, Digital Content Ratings, their presence in our portfolio completely changes the discussion. When we are renewing our contracts with the big media companies. And so while Jamere's comment is more focused on the direct incremental revenues, which mostly come from the digital first players in the marketplace, if you could imagine, which I don't really choose to do, but if you could imagine, what our contract renewals would be like with the big media conglomerates if we didn't have Digital Ad Ratings and Digital Content Ratings and our Total Audience Measurement system, it would be a completely different picture than what you see rolling through our numbers in the core. That's by far the more significant contribution that those products make in our Watch business right now. And the other parts we love as well, we love it just as much but it's at the moment not quite as big.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, guys. Good morning. Just one question each on the Buy and Watch segments, Mitch, could you just refresh us on where your relationships with Amazon and Alibaba stand in terms of their participation in various Buy products?","And then just on the Watch side, a bit more of a minor one, perhaps just an update on the status in the audio market, both progress on your own initiatives as well as perhaps your comments on the competitive environment, as we know the industry is looking for a sort of co-op collective solution or has initiated that, you obviously have another independent competitor there. I'd just be interested to hear an update on it as well. Thank you.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Sure. Thanks, Dan. First on your first question related to Buy and e-commerce. We've continued the development of our e-commerce solution for the U.S. where we're bringing together some of our panel data, some other third party data and big data sources, all together in a hybrid solution that allows us to cover the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, both the extensions of the brick and mortar players and the pure play e-commerce platforms including the largest players out there. We're bringing that forward to the marketplace and by the end of this year, that'll be in the hands of a growing number of our clients and start to roll through our business in a more full way in 2017, that's the U.S. And we have similar solutions that employ basically the same design, depends on the country, in 11 other markets where e-commerce sales are significant around the world.","With regard to Amazon, they \u2013 no change really in their status, in terms of their willingness to share their sales data, like retailers typically do with us as we measure fast moving consumer goods, they still prefer to remain on the outside of that collaboration model, cooperation model that typifies our retail measurement service. And so, like we've done with Netflix on the Watch side of the business, we find other ways to measure the activity on those kinds of platforms. We've done that very successfully on the Watch side covering Netflix and other subscription video on demand platforms. And we're able to do it on the Buy side as well to measure what's happening on Amazon's platform.","With regard to Alibaba, we continue to be very closely in touch and active with Alibaba in the China market, as well as, Tencent and Sina and Baidu and a lot of the other really big players. In U.S. we have FANG; Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In China they have their similar four or five major players and we're active with all of them. I was in China last month with our teams and part of that also included a meeting with the most senior leaders at Baidu and talking about how we're going to continue to broaden our relationship there and Alibaba continues to be very active and a key focus for our business in the China market.","On your \u2013 on part B of your one question, Dan. With regarding audio and the competitive situation in the industry. First on audio, we're still thrilled with that business. It did exactly what we expected, low-single-digit growth, strong free cash flows. You're now seeing us gain some leverage from the audio business in a new way, leveraging the PPM measurement capability to add more effective sample size to our local TV measurement over on the video side of the equation.","And then, we're continuing to pursue international wins in the Radio Audience Measurement business through the capabilities we have. We have some of those in our history and there's a few more opportunities in front of us. And the other thing we're doing there is obviously continuing to bring our analytics portfolio to the radio industry to help them better tell their ROI and penetration story in the marketplace.","On the cooperative industry collaboration that's going on to try to prop up a competitive alternative, it uses ACR technology, automated content recognition technology. I think that's the one you are probably referring to. Look, we're very familiar with that kind of technology. We have it ourselves already in our tool bag. We know what it's good for and how \u2013 what it works well for and we also know quite a bit about its limitations. And so, we're staying focused on our strategy in \u2013 on audience measurement and currency-grade measurement that the marketplace trades on. It has representative panels that represent all the key segments of the marketplace in a manner that's always been important, currently is and will remain important. That's what Nielsen's about. And that's easier said than done, we know that from experience.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Cary from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. One more on the Buy business. While it was understandably too early to give any 2017 guidance, how should we be thinking about the growth rates in the developed markets beyond 2016, even if just directionally? And clearly you're doing a lot to evolve the business. Just trying to gauge how long it could take before the developed business returns to more historical growth rates. Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Let me start. Maybe, Jamere, you will add. Look, especially for the U.S., we're planning for it to continue to be a tough environment next year. So we're starting there and then we're thinking about our cost base, our allocation of resources, our investment in our key initiatives, with that as the starting point. If the environment improves then that's going to be great. But if it doesn't, we're building our plan with that tough growth environment in mind, again because we don't see this as just a cycle that the market is passing through. That's our judgment of what we're seeing in the marketplace, we see it as more of a secular shift and we're designing and transforming our product portfolio accordingly.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. I mean, we'll give more color in December at Analyst Day, but what I'll say from a total company standpoint is you've all seen our long-term growth framework, what we guided for this year was in line with that long term growth framework and I would say just based on what we're seeing in developed Buy that we're planning for a year that's at the lower end of that growth range. And again we'll give a lot more color at Analyst Day, we're working through our 2017 operating plan over the next few weeks and we'll fill out the picture then.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, thanks. So it does seem like this is a fairly important initiative you're taking on and there will be effects beyond the Q3 just reported. We have the Q4 guidance, I respect you're not going to give us much on 2017 yet. But your restructuring charges as you mentioned earlier, Jamere, are going to be toward the upper-end. How will you be reporting restructuring and other below-the-line items after this year?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, it's a great question. So, as many of you know, when I took the CFO job in 2014, I rated myself as a plain vanilla GAAP kind of CFO and we're marching towards that path. I would say a couple of things, you \u2013 those of you who followed our business over the last few years know sort of where we've been consistently with things like restructuring and one-time items, cash taxes, et cetera. So we've reached a point in our cycle in our maturity that we know pretty much where those line items are going to come in and quite frankly, we feel comfortable being measured against them. And so you'll see us provide a lot more clarity around how we'll guide going forward at our 2017 Analyst Day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Thomas W. Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. Thank you. Just a follow-up on developed Buy business. We saw the same light organic growth in the U.S. business versus other markets at several ad agencies this past quarter, namely OMC and IPG. So is your business a leading indicator of theirs or vice versa, and then additionally, how would you describe or explain the dynamics for your competition in that business? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","I don't know that we're a lead versus theirs or vice versa, I think it's the same wallet and a lot of the same dynamics. Within our portfolio, we do know that there are some parts that do tend to see these kinds of swings in the marketplace sooner than others. For instance, we've always seen that in our innovation analytics, the innovation analytics part of our business, that tends to swing down or swing back up as a lead indicator of some of the other discretionary services in our portfolio, but as a whole, I think our broad portfolio and the broad portfolio of services that the media and advertising agencies provide, we're probably moving more similarly to each other rather than one being lead versus the other.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","I just think it's indicative of the environment. When we talk to our clients, particularly as I talk to CFOs at our clients, they are all very focused on every line item of the P&L just like we are and agencies aren't immune, the discretionary parts of our business aren't immune. And so I think it's just indicative of the environment that you're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. On the long-term framework, you've also provided us for margins. You've talked about a lot of margin levers. It sounds like you still think you have to pull, but just wanted to gauge your sense of comfort with the long-term margin framework you previously provided and is it reasonable to expect that it may be below that pace of expansion at least in the intermediate term, call it 2017, 2018 as you go through some of these changes? Thank you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. As I said, we're currently working through our 2017 operating plans over the next few weeks or so and we'll certainly fill out the picture at December Analyst Day. Three things that I have a lot of confidence in; the first is that in our Buy business, we're continuing to see scale benefits from the emerging markets and that's certainly a tailwind for margins. The intensity around cost out and productivity has not waned inside the company and we've got a very strong deck of productivity projects that are going to produce margin expansion for us inside the company. And then I'd say the third thing is that the restructuring efforts that you saw us take in the last couple of quarters are going to give us the right trajectory.","So again, we'll manage the margin expansion inside the total company. You'll see us guide to what that is. We'll balance that with the real window of opportunity that we have here to accelerate this journey that we're on in our Buy business and accelerate the growth initiatives that we have in our Watch business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask about the new rating standard and assuming it's ready in time for 2017 upfronts. Just to ask about the direct and indirect revenue opportunity for you guys in terms pricing modules and so on and then as part of that I just wanted to double check the Watch guidance that you've given for the segment. It had been 6% to 7% I believe and I just want to double check that.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","I'll take the first one. Jamere will cover the second one for you, Bill. Thanks for the question. On the currency definition, I commented on that earlier, maybe just a thing to add. We've had this series of meetings with the industry, the most recent one was last week. We continue to narrow in on the definition and there are a lot of reasons for us to be confident that our Total Audience Measurement system's going to play a big role in the 2017 upfronts.","Let me tell you what we're hearing though also, not just what Nielson thinks, but what some of the key industry players think. One example is Rino Scanzoni. He is the Chief Investment Officer at GroupM. He was quoted a few weeks ago saying something like, we're looking probably to making the Total Audience the currency in the next upfront, then what he said was, \"We have to go there.\" There is 10% to 12% more audience if you're factoring the viewing on these other devices. His voice is really important because well, he was central to the C3 metric 10 years ago when that was converged on by the industry and has since served as the definition of the currency. So, that's how Rino is thinking about the Total Audience and the new definition of the currency for the 2017 upfront.","David Poltrack, Chief Research Officer at CBS, he was just more direct, he just said, \"We're definitely moving forward.\" That was his attitude toward it. And so, I think the key to this way of thinking for these key industry influencers are the fact that we've passed the syndication point for Digital Content Ratings, at the end of September. We are on the path to fully syndicate Total Content Ratings by the early part of 2017. Already in full syndication for the participating publishers, we're just going to add agencies and other members of the of ecosystem in the early part of the year. Those are the last few pieces in the puzzle. And so, we've delivered on those and that's why I think everybody is pretty confident in terms of this measurement system. And some sense of what that new currency definition is going to be playing an important role in the 2017 upfronts.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, in terms of our Watch guidance, this year, we guided 4.5% to 6.5%, you've seen us on a year-to-date basis be at about 6.3%. And for the fourth quarter the only thing that \u2013 for those of you who are modeling have to adjust for is that remember, we lap the NCS consolidation in the fourth quarter last year and we're also lapping the NRG divestiture in the fourth quarter. So those are the only material adjustments that you need to make and I think they're in the right ballpark.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning, Mitch. Good morning, Jamere. I want to go back to the Buy business. If I think of it as data tools and people, I'd say that the issues that you currently have are on the people based side of it. These are expensive resources that you have from consultants and such to expense and as you do the restructuring, as you go through that, I just want to figure out what are we talking about in terms of eventual sort of head count drops, what are we talking about in terms of cash restructuring associated with that. And then as you move to Connected Buy and build out an ecosystem, how is the economics going to work with regards to how you share across the ecosystem?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","So, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let Mitch sort of chime in. I think your characterization of our businesses is exactly right. What the Connected System does is it transitions our Buy business to look a little bit more like an info services business than it does today. Currently for a lot of the things that we've been talking about, we have more of a people as a service business mix than a typical info services company, and so the implication is that we'll have a higher margin business post the transition as we'll have more opportunities to fill data as a service and software as a service business. And as Mitch said, this should add tremendous value and reduce cost on the client side and it should help us be more efficient and more productive in terms of how we deliver that service to our clients, and so it's an exciting transition for us.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","And the idea of people remains every bit as important in that future business model versus how they've been important in our business historically. What it will mean is a different mix of people, slightly different set of skills and different roles inside the business.","As our system, Connected System, this hugely important initiative that we're focused on is developed, it will be connected directly to our clients' business processes and systems, whereas right now there's a lot of manual intervention required, both on our side and on our client side in order to draw full value out of these data resources that we provide to our clients.","So, it creates a lot of efficiencies, both on our side and on our client side, and that's back to our point about, this is a stronger higher margin business, more valuable to Nielsen and more valuable to our clients. So, that's the transition we'll work through. It's not a flip the switch kind of impact though. It's a gradual transition that will evolve over time. We've done some restructuring already and if we get to the point where we see the next move that needs to be made on that front, of course you'll see us do it.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Doug Arthur from Huber Research. Your line is open.","Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Mitch, in terms of the national TV out of home measurement roll out, how significant could that be to growth, is it modest or more than modest?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","For our business modest. It will be a very important addition to our capabilities for certain clients and not so important for others. For instance, if you're March Madness, if you are one of the networks carrying March Madness, it's a big deal. If you are CNN, if you are CNBC, these kinds of networks, this is a big deal. But others that are, maybe their programming is more serial based genre or sitcoms, things of that nature, this isn't as high a priority for those kinds of networks. And so, you'll see it work its way through our client portfolio accordingly and it'll all add up to a being a modest impact on our business. But look, that's what's required, when you take on the task of measuring the total audience, you can't just go for the easy parts or the more efficient parts. To really live up to that standard and to fulfill that vision, you got to take it all on and this is part of that.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Mitch Barns for closing remarks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, just to take one minute before we wrap up to share a few closing thoughts in terms of how I see the overall picture. Watch business again we continue to be thrilled with the progress, the syndication of Digital Content Ratings and the path we're on for full syndication of Total Content Ratings. The overall Total Audience Measurement system gaining adoption and well positioned for the 2017 upfronts.","On top of that, the improvements that we're rolling out for our local TV ratings business, our Watch business really on a roll. Marketing Effectiveness, strong growth, more than 30% in the quarter.","Our Buy business, emerging remained solid. Even within developed, Europe, the Pacific, Canada all turned in solid quarters of growth. The U.S. is where we have the declines. A tough environment, we've talked about, we're judging these to be secular shifts and we're responding accordingly. In terms of the magnitude and the pace of the changes we're making in our business to reduce our cost base, reallocate our resources, accelerate our investments, in particular in this Connected system that helps us move from what today is much of a people as a service business model to be much more of a data as a service and software as a service business model in the future.","All of it adds up to a stronger, higher margin business for Nielsen going forward, and we're going to continue to update you on our progress on the Connected system front on future calls and of course, at our December Analyst Day, much like we have done with Total Audience and its development over the past many quarters.","So, thanks again for everybody for tuning to the call. Thanks for your questions and we'll look forward to talking with you in the days and weeks ahead.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Please note all lines are in listen-only mode at this time.","I will now turn the call over to the host, Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Zale, please proceed.","Elizabeth Zale","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank for joining us to discuss Nielsen\u2019s first quarter financial performance. Joining me on the call today from Nielsen is David Calhoun, Chief Executive Officer, and Brian West, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations and prospects. These and other statements that relate to future financial results and events are based on Nielsen\u2019s view as of today, April 25, 2012. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","The risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in Nielsen\u2019s 2011 Form 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find on ir.nielsen.com. We encourage you to consult these documents for a more complete understanding of these risks and uncertainties. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by securities laws.","A slide presentation that we\u2019ll use on this call is available under the event section of our website at ir.nielsen.com. We use certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the results of our operations. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results of operations. Further definition and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our results under GAAP is available at the end of our press release within the appendix of the webcast slide presentation and also on our IR website.","And now to start the call, I\u2019d like to introduce our CEO, David Calhoun.","David Calhoun","","Hi, good morning, everyone. We\u2019ll start off with the big numbers in the first quarter. Revenue grew 3% on a reported basis, 4% on the constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. Net debt leverage of four times, and we completed a secondary offering, and I guess everyone knows, increasing our float 34.5 million shares.","With respect to business conditions, in light of what I consider to be the toughest comp we would face at least since I\u2019ve been here, and the pause related to of course the incorporation of Walmart data, I feel very good about the business and about the revenue performance. I consider it both resilient and positive with respect to client points of view.","If you break down growth, you\u2019ll see our developing markets grew roughly 11%, that\u2019s versus a 19% comp a year ago. It was interesting. If there\u2019s any phenomena going on there that might take that number down a bit relative to the past, and it\u2019s hard to actually put your finger on it, it would be that global multinationals are just a little more selective than they have been about country and category combinations as they continue their global development. But I don\u2019t see them letting up at all, it\u2019s just being selective.","With respect to investing for growth, we remain very much on track. Walmart continues to go well. Most of the operational risks related to the data incorporation into our metric, all those things that we\u2019re doing with and for Walmart for their insight and benefit are going very well. We continue to be on plan, and I would say most of those risks are behind us.","Global reach and read, we continue to invest in very strongly. This again hits rural China, rural India, and broadly in Africa, and momentum in those markets continues to support those investments. We continue to invest in online campaign ratings. It\u2019s going very well. I\u2019ll talk about that a little later. And then marketing effectiveness, which is really \u2013 feeds our insight practices and combines the Watch and Buy data that we have across our enterprise.","All in all, I feel very good about again, the revenue performance, where we are situated with clients and the prospects (audio gap). We will reaffirm both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the year and raise our earnings per share $0.06.","With respect to key initiatives, I mentioned the U.S. retail expansion, which is Walmart, which is the single biggest coverage expansion we\u2019ve had in certainly my history, but I think over a couple of decades. It is still on track for late second quarter delivery. With respect to manufacturing negotiations and customer negotiations, we are complete, and that\u2019s reflected in our 2012 guidance. And importantly, as I mentioned on the last call, we are beginning to see the re-emergence of insight opportunities related to the incorporation of that data.","With respect to online campaign ratings and cross-platform measurement, which was introduced over that first quarter, we really do have commercial traction for what is the only accredited measurement in online advertising. Importantly, you saw two big publishers announce that they would guarantee audiences on the basis of that metric. That was very important to us. And we saw that one significant agency interest talked about the incorporation of both OCR and XCR cross-platform into their work with advertisers.","Viewability has now been solved for inside the metrics, so we meet all the standards that are necessary to account for viewability. We like the momentum with advertisers. And XCR, which is a very important metric because it identifies the unduplicated reach across both TV and online, becomes in a central metric for most advertiser campaigns because it allows them to seamlessly manage the campaign across both mediums and again, we look forward to the prospects.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. Of course I\u2019ll answer whatever questions you have at the end. Brian?","Brian West","","Thanks, Dave. If you turn to page 8, as Dave mentioned, another consistent quarter for the company. Revenue came in at $1.340 billion, that\u2019s up 4% on a constant currency basis. We saw it across just about every part of the company. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $332 million, that\u2019s up 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded over 20 basis points. So again, that\u2019s also in the light of reinvesting, as Dave mentioned, while still expanding our margins. Adjusted income came in at $113 million and $0.30 per share, benefited by both lower income taxes as well as lower interest charges.","And free cash flow was a usage of $85 million, so good quarter. In terms of the FX impact, there was 130 basis point FX unfavorability on both revenue and EBITDA as we rolled \u2013 finished up the quarter.","Turning to page 9, segment revenue, the Total Buy business was just shy of $800 million, that\u2019s up 5% constant currency year-over-year. As Dave mentioned, our developing markets were up 11%. Our North America, broadly speaking, where we collect revenues across the company, was up 4% and then there is other developed markets that were up 1%, primarily pressured by Western Europe. If you look at Buy business, information, developing markets up 10%, developed up 1% that\u2019s again largely driven by that Western Europe pressure.","Our Insights business was up 7% year-over-year, that\u2019s 14% developing markets and 3% in the developed world. On the Watch side, revenues were $480 million, that\u2019s up 3%. Expo, it\u2019s just over $60 million, up 9% and that rounds you out at the $1.340 billion in total.","On page 10, profitability, adjusted EBITDA by segment, Buy $121 million, that\u2019s up 3%, reflective of the investments that we\u2019re making particularly in global reach and read with Africa, China, India, still being priorities as well as the Walmart data. On the Watch side, EBITDA came in at $185 million, that\u2019s up 5%. And then we also continue to invest across the capabilities of audience shifts in our ability to measure it across multiple platforms. Expo\u2019s at $36 million, up 9%, again, rounds you out to the 332, up 5% for the total company.","Turning to page 11 on cash flow, in the upper left-hand corner, free cash flow was a usage of $85 million, that\u2019s in line with the seasonality of the business. CapEx came in at $82 million, that\u2019s higher than last year, but more representative. Last year was just artificially low. Cash taxes for the quarter was $23 million, that\u2019s a little bit lower based on both timing and some planning work that we\u2019ve been working on, and then restructuring of $25 million.","On the balance sheet, net debt came in at $6.273 billion, and the ratio, as Dave mentioned, was four times. On the cap table, couple of highlights, the loan debt was up basically $120 million based on short-term revolver to one adjusted seasonality, I mentioned as well as take out mandatory debt paydowns, which were some EMTNs that were due. On the weighted average interest rate in the bottom, it came down from 4.68% \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 5.68% to 5.6%, eight bps, that was benefited by lower LIBOR versus year-end, as well as paying down that mandatory debt, as I mentioned.","On page 12, addressing guidance. So as Dave mentioned, we\u2019re reaffirming our revenue growth at 5% to 7% constant currency. Again, the first half will be the low-end, the second half will be the higher-end driven by the Walmart. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30 to 50 bps constant currency. As you saw in the first quarter, less expansion first-half driven by the investments we\u2019re making, and acceleration in the second half as that Walmart comes through. Adjusted income growth is 15% to 20% constant currency. That is up versus what we had out there, which was 13% to 17%, driven by interest expense favorability, talk more about that in a minute.","The deleveraging was still on track for about a half a turn of deleveraging. And in the reported earnings per share, if we look at rates as of Monday, so April 23, we would expect the range to be $1.76 to $1.82. That\u2019s up $0.06 versus what we had addressed with everyone in February. There is about $0.035 for foreign exchange that\u2019s moved, and about $0.025 for interest, which I will talk about in a moment.","With this earnings per share guidance, explicit in that is that there is an unfavorable impact on revenue for about 180 basis points, that is down versus what we thought, so it\u2019s less negative. And about 150 point unfavorability based on EBITDA. So rates are getting better than we thought, but they will still be a drag on the reported results. Again, we measure ourselves on constant currency, because that\u2019s the right way to evaluate the economics of the business.","On the bottom, the only thing I would highlight, CapEx and depreciation are still within the range that we had talked about in February. The book interest is, we have revised that lower. That was 430 to 440. We\u2019ve taken that down to be lower interest based on one, the first quarter actuals as well as the update of the forward LIBOR curve. That forward LIBOR curve was 60 bps as we turn the corner into 2012 and that\u2019s now down to 29 bps, so that favorability will come through when we expect it, thereby raising the guidance.","Cash taxes, $150 million to $160 million, that is trending toward the low end of that range, and we\u2019ll update more as we get into the second quarter when we see the first full half, because there is timing associated with cash taxes as there always is, and there\u2019s no change to cash restructuring.","With that, I will turn it over to Liz who can open up Q&A.","Elizabeth Zale","","Absolutely. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Absolutely. Our first question, and pardon the pronunciation, comes from Brian Karimzad from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hi, good morning. Dave, a couple questions on emerging markets. I guess first can you give us a sense of where, if there\u2019s anywhere in particular, the multinationals are being more selective in the category and country development? And then maybe for Brian, if we were to look back at the K where you give disclosure on geographies, in 2011, you actually showed some nice margin expansion in the Americas excluding the United States, which I presume a big part of that is Brazil. Can you give us some color as to whether that was driven by Brazil maturing as a developing market, and maybe a sense for how many years ahead they are versus some of the other places you\u2019re investing like India and China?","David Calhoun","","Well, let me start with respect to country SKUs, if I read our results and implicit in that is being selective, Southeast Asia seems to be the one that has sort of taken the biggest hit. Again, it\u2019s still growthy, but it\u2019s not double digit. And broadly speaking, that\u2019s the soft spot. China, India, and while Africa is small, the outlook for Africa remains very robust.","Brian West","","Yeah, in terms of margin expansion, so our Latin America business overall is very profitable. And as you mentioned, Brazil is a place where it doesn\u2019t require a lot of investment and you\u2019ve got great competitive dynamics, and as Dave mentioned, it\u2019s growing double digits. So those benefits will accrue to us. How farther ahead is Brazil than the other markets? I always describe it as probably Brazil is in the late innings of the game, and China is in the early innings, Africa is just getting started.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Brian. Operator, our next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Michael Meltz of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan","","Two questions for you. Brian, I know \u2013 or Dave, I know you don\u2019t like to give quarterly guidance. Can you give us a sense, is Q1 going to be the low point of constant currency revenue growth for the year? And then I have a follow-up.","Brian West","","Well, like I said, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. But we have said is that if you think about the 5% to 7% growth for the year, we always said that the first half was going to be towards the lower end, and that the second half will be towards the higher end. And I will \u2013 you know as well as I do, is the first quarter comp as Dave mentioned was one of the tougher ones. So and I think that will all play out through the course of the year, we still feel confident in the revenue guidance.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay.","Elizabeth Zale","","And we have a consistent seasonal progression, Michael.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. And then there\u2019s a small company you might have heard of called Google that announced some new measurement initiatives. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the online or digital measurement landscape shaping up, please?","David Calhoun","","Yeah, look, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve always said and I\u2019ll repeat it 1,000 times, because this will happen about every nine months. This market is loaded with captive measurements, it just is. Everybody who has a major publishing interest, anybody particularly who has of course the DoubleClick interest in their case, are going to try to build a metric around it that supports their case. I get it, it\u2019ll always be that way. Our job is to build a metric that crosses all forms of distribution, all forms of publishing. That is what we try to do, that is what advertisers pay us to do, that\u2019s what agency interests are. So we still feel very good and confident that we\u2019re going down the right path here.","And I still believe that as captive metrics develop over time, there will be something complementary in what they do relative to what we do. But for now, I don\u2019t consider them \u2013 I don\u2019t consider that one to be a face-off for one simple reason, and that is because it represents that single form of distribution or in this case, publishing site. And I believe our metric and underlying demos are at least as good, and frankly better. So I\u2019m not \u2013 I just don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think about it as a direct threat.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay, thank you.","David Calhoun","","Yeah.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please?","Operator","","Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Suzi Stein of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hi, can you just give us more of an update on OCR adoption in terms of how many customers you have interested and signed up? Do you have paying customers, and kind of when would you expect to see an impact on revenue?","David Calhoun","","Yeah, Suzi, so we\u2019re being very deliberately patient on this one. So I know I\u2019ll frustrate you on it, but we are. The good news is we\u2019re up to 750 campaigns. I think the last time I spoke to anyone, it was around 600. We\u2019ve got 50 advertisers and agencies involved. That was a smaller number last time we talked. And we\u2019ve got 60 publishers and ad networks. So the use of it and the incorporation of it into sort of their campaign planning is actually going beautifully. And as I always said, the use cases are being developed. So if you sat down with our team and sort of interviewed them about the value component of this product, they all are feeling very good about it.","As I mentioned before, getting the industry aligned around it is the toughest hurdle and we\u2019re just going to continue on this deliberate path. We do have paying customers and it\u2019s going well. We do have now two publishers who have issued guarantees around the metric itself. You may recall when we kicked this off second half of last year, that was our hope, that someday that would happen. To be totally honest with you, I never expected that to happen this year. So things are going well on that front. When it becomes a meaningful revenue number, we\u2019ll be the first one to tell you, raise our hand and feel good about it. But so far, we have seen no lull in the adoption, the use, and the case work that\u2019s being done by the advertisers.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And then I\u2019m just trying to understand the currency issue a bit more. In your filings, it looks like revenue and operating costs are pretty well paired. So I get that while fluctuations in currency would affect revenue, why would adjusted EBITDA be impacted almost as much?","David Calhoun","","Well, we\u2019re not \u2013 have a reporting phenomena for translating all that all back. It hits both revenue and your cost, and the result is EBITDA. So believe it or not, they\u2019re more likely to be aligned. And our historical pattern has been that they are pretty close. There might be 10 or 20 bps off, but generally speaking, the impact is fairly close. So in this case, the first quarter, I think it was 180 bps of revenue pressure and 150 bps of margin pressure, so that\u2019s just the way it works.","Elizabeth Zale","","Actually, for the first quarter it was 130 bps.","David Calhoun","","Sorry, 130 bps, I\u2019m sorry, Ii gave you full year numbers, I\u2019m sorry. 130 bps roughly for both and the numbers I gave you where what we expect the trajectory for the full year to be.","Elizabeth Zale","","Right.","Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay, all right, thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Suzi. Operator, next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Great, thanks. Hey, Dave, could you talk about the progress you\u2019re having in bringing on additional demographic data sources for the OCR offering?","David Calhoun","","Well, we\u2019re doing well. We do have at least one other significant publisher who is embarked on the sort of the technology roadmap to get there and inform the tag, that\u2019ll be very important to us. So the progress is good and I can\u2019t name names, so I apologize for that. But we\u2019re through tough hurdles and now it\u2019s actually just implementing and incorporating it into the metric. But everyone including advertisers will be happy with where we are.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Okay. Then as we look out past 2012, how should we think about the levels of investment in the Watch segment, considering cross-platform and OCR have been launched already?","David Calhoun","","I think you\u2019ll find it \u2013 our need for investment there will decrease somewhat. There will be some global investment that we\u2019re going to embark on for activities that are yet to be announced, but it won\u2019t be the same order of magnitude that an OCR program would require. So I guess whatever guidance I can give you is I expect it to be somewhat less, but not quite as much as just flipping the switch from OCR to nothing. We still have other growth opportunities.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","","All right, thanks a lot.","David Calhoun","","Yep.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Eric. Next question, Operator?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Hi, thanks. Good morning. The Insights business reaccelerated, which maybe was a bit of a surprise, given that you\u2019re still working on getting the Walmart data in there. Could you give us an update on what you think drove that? Was it Walmart related or was it something else?","Brian West","","Yeah, our Insights business, as I mentioned, in the developing markets were up a healthy 14% in the quarter. Western Europe actually was pressured, I think reflective of some of the economic points Dave was making. North America was up a very nice growth rate, and we are starting to see the impact of Walmart. So we do feel good about the prospects for Insights business, and we think that Walmart, when it gets fully integrated, would create more momentum, not less. So we feel good about where we\u2019re positioned for Insights.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And then switching gears a little bit, if you could just give us some updated thoughts on the competitive landscape in Watch, and maybe how you\u2019re thinking about the use of set-top box data over time?","David Calhoun","","Well, I don\u2019t think a lot has changed on the competitive landscape. We talk about local, which is really where set-top box will \u2013 or has taken effect. You\u2019ll recall that most of the progress that is made on that front has been for sell side interests, not buy side interests, which is significant. We love set-top box data, and we will incorporate set-top box data into our metrics on local markets because we believe it will improve stability, and that is what they need in a pretty big way. We know that.","And we like the game plan we have in place to deliver on that promise, but we\u2019re going to do it exactly the right way. As a standalone, we do not believe set-top box meets the test. We don\u2019t believe it is \u2013 will ever be an accredited metric for the market. And so we\u2019re just going to continue on our path, and I believe our competitive position will actually be improved, it won\u2019t be worse than where it is today. I feel very good about that.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Thank you.","David Calhoun","","Remember we\u2019re talking about a very small part of the market.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Sara. Operator, next question?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Douglas Arthur \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Yeah, on developed markets growth of 1% in constant currency, I mean you\u2019ve talked about some of the factors. Can you sort of elaborate on what specific areas drove that? And is there \u2013 is the 1% vulnerable to slowing down, or how do you see that playing out?","Brian West","","Yeah, really that was the other developed markets, primarily Western Europe. And Western Europe for us, as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s sluggish, it\u2019s pressured, it has been, we had contemplated it being pressured. So for us, it\u2019s really no surprise. And we think as that economic outlook gets better, that that will improve. I think in the U.S., we feel very good about our Total Buy business. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re feeling nice progress in our Insights business, so that all feels good. I think it\u2019s literally discrete economies, primarily Western Europe, that pressure it.","Douglas Arthur \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Okay, thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Doug. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt Chesler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Hi, a couple of questions. Within the Watch division, can you give us an update on the trends there that you\u2019re seeing? The division was up 3% constant currency, but TV was up 3.6%. So how much longer do you think you will see pressure in some of those print tracking revenues in Europe? A question around the timing of the Walmart delivery, you\u2019ve highlighted that it\u2019s a late second quarter effect. Should we expect that your entire customer base is going to be moving there in unison, or may there be a phased-in of that delivery?","David Calhoun","","Well, let me \u2013 I\u2019ll start, let me just start with the Walmart one. Of course it\u2019s never in unison, so we won\u2019t hit the start button. But actually from your guys\u2019 point of view, it might look or feel that way. And so 3Q will get a reasonably bigger impact because of the way the commercial terms have been negotiated. So I \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 no, it doesn\u2019t start in unison, that\u2019s not the way it is. On the other hand, you will see an appreciable move in that quarter for sure.","Matt Chesler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Will there be any revenue recognition in the second quarter the way that it structured commercially?","David Calhoun","","No.","Brian West","","No.","Matt Chesler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay.","Brian West","","Nothing meaningful, Matt.","Matt Chesler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay.","Brian West","","On the Watch side, we\u2019ve always talk about our Watch business is being a 4 to 5% grower. The quarter\u2019s always vary, if you remember last, first quarter Watch was up 7% because of some of timing. But think about 4% to 5%, it\u2019s pretty consistent through the course of the full year.","In terms of our TV business, very steady as you mentioned. There are some pressure points around different geographies we are in outside the US and more developed markets. I also think that we have a ton of confidence in OCR, and there is other parts of the online products that we just are going to let move into planning mode, and we are going to let pretty much run off. And that\u2019s just something as we transition to a bigger, better product, we feel very comfortable with. You\u2019ll see some of that.","Matt Chesler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay, thanks.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Matt. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Kelly Flynn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thanks. Actually kind of building on the last question. Related to the back half acceleration. You explicitly called out Walmart as the key driver ,but I\u2019m wondering, do you actually expect Watch will accelerate as well as Buy in the back half? And then related to that, I know you are being kind of conservative on OCR, but are you thinking about OCR as something that could drive incremental growth points or does it more just kind of keep you in the range that you\u2019ve historically guided to? Thanks.","David Calhoun","","Yeah, so on the first one, the answer is yes. I\u2019d say modestly the case, so the back half is favored somewhat. With respect to OCR, the word conservative, I\u2019m just going to switch to deliberate. We really want this to get the extensive kind of use cases that it is \u2013 that it is getting. And we\u2019re going to be disciplined about the contracts that we ultimately take for this service. And we have been \u2013 I feel very good about that.","So yes, we expect this to be a contributor to our revenue and we expect to be able to talk about it with you guys on a regular basis. I don\u2019t think this year you\u2019re going to see meaningful moves, and our plan and our guidance has always contemplated that. So that we would give ourselves ample room to do this the right way. But we get into next year, we can\u2019t see numbers begin to move, then obviously we\u2019ll be disappointed.","So yes, we do expect it to be meaningful. As Brian said, in many ways we ate our young on this one, we knew this was going to be the product, so we\u2019ve allowed other parts of that former online measurement service that we\u2019ve been running for years, in effect to depreciate. But that\u2019s okay, we did this very consciously.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay. And just I mean not to be nitpicky, but on Watch accelerating potentially slightly in the back half also, do you think that because you\u2019re assuming a little benefit from OCR? Or are you assuming some of these macro headwinds in Europe weighing a bit?","David Calhoun","","Yeah, both.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay.","David Calhoun","","No, I wouldn\u2019t say macro factors. I would just say seasonal factors that we know that we see. I wouldn\u2019t call them macro factors. And then, yes, we do expect a very little bit of lift coming out of that OCR product.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Kelly. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","","Good morning. Question for you on if you could talk a little bit about the exclusivity of the arrangement with Facebook for OCR? And then also on Walmart. If you could help us think a little bit about how that flows through for information versus insight? And then a housekeeping question for Brian just on the tax rate going forward, how we should look for that.","Brian West","","I\u2019ll do the tax rate, just to get that one out of the way. Our cash taxes at $150 million to $160 million range put us in that same range we\u2019ve been talking over the long-term, it\u2019s the 20% to 25%. If anything, that might get, as I mentioned trend towards the lower end of that range just based on some plenty of things that we are working on, but it\u2019s still pretty consistent over the long-term.","I think relative to \u2013 we feel terrific about our relationship with Facebook. No one else is working with them, no one else has got TV, and we are very proud of which we have and which we continue to have. So we feel like we are the only one who\u2019s got this product and we are working hard on making sure we can get out in the marketplace.","And at Walmart, Walmart is something that was never an exclusive data arrangement deliberately because when you start to get exclusive in the cooperative world of retail, it all falls apart. So both of those, we feel good about the commercial relationships and the progress, and working our tails off with regard to introducing products to the marketplace.","David Calhoun","","Yeah, I\u2019ll just repeat. We really do have policy, we don\u2019t, we just don\u2019t like big exclusives, it\u2019s not good for our industry. We like our products to stand on their own because they\u2019ve been designed the right way and they support the partners. And in this case in both cases, I believe we will stand that test and that will be good for everybody. So that\u2019s really the way we approach all these business opportunities. I don\u2019t want to build something around pure exclusivity just not, it\u2019s not good for our game.","Brian West","","We\u2019d rather lean into unique capabilities, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s the differentiating factor that Nielsen brings to the party.","Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James","","Thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Bill. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Good morning, thanks. I\u2019d just like to expand a little bit on some of the questions already been asked. One is on your traditional TV measurement business. If you could talk a little bit more about further time shifting if C plus 3 could potentially expand to a greater time period. And I guess this feeds into the OCR question, I guess, how do you envision this business evolving over time? Will it be a single ratings across Internet and TV both? Or will you probably keep them as separate businesses?","David Calhoun","","Yeah, so good question. So time shifted has been a phenomena that\u2019s gone on for quite a while. The percentage change toward time shift will actually slow down somewhat just because so many people already incorporate it into their viewing habits. And it, of course, got incorporated into C3. Our users will look at this every year, every quarter, and pressure us to incorporate more time shifting viewing, if they think it\u2019s right. And if the accreditation standards can be achieved through that process, which I know and believe they can.","We actually have paying sell side clients, who actually want the data that we already have past C3 and almost C7. And so we work on programs with them for that. So it\u2019s just that it\u2019s not \u201cthe accepted currency.\u201d So there are all kinds of insights we can provide for sell side interest on that front or buy side interest. It\u2019s the way the technology platform is set up, we can incorporate it. I just don\u2019t want to guess where it goes. Our clients will actually \u2013 they\u2019ll tell us where it goes over time and it will all be done through the accreditation process. I\u2019m sorry, what was the other question?","Elizabeth Zale","","The second question was around will there be a single rating across platforms...","David Calhoun","","Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t believe there will be. I think there are still represented interests from the publishing side to want to know what their contribution is, and from the TV side who want to know what theirs is. On the other hand, that unduplicated reach number is a very important number for campaign interests, who pay everybody\u2019s bill.","So our view is the XCR, which will give a firm grounding on both a TV metric and an online metric, and then allow for that unduplicated reach number to get completed, I think is the approach that most users tell us they want. And it accommodates the kinds of objectives they have in mind. So I feel, I think, I feel good about that. I don\u2019t see this one going down to a single currency across all.","Elizabeth Zale","","And just to be clear from when Dave is referring to buy side and sell side, he is talking about the media content owners being the sellers versus the buyers of that platform, the advertisers.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Yeah, thanks.","Elizabeth Zale","","Great, thank you. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Hi, good morning. So couple of questions regarding restructuring, one sort of tactile and one more strategic. So just tactically, we see your guidance for the year, thanks. Just wanted to explore a little bit the difference between cash and GAAP charges. I think we understand why those can be different in the timing but just so the GAAP charges quarter was I think $37 million, so a lot higher than cash. Do you think that will sort of converge over the year or should we be thinking about the GAAP charges a lot higher than the cash for the year?","And then sort of more importantly and more strategically, just a question, so over time, there has been a fair amount of restructuring every year as you guys do productivity initiatives. I think, we all get that. Just looking at the buy segment just want to think about, if you\u2019ve been taking costs out there through restructuring programs at a fairly significant rate, then we think about the reinvestment.","I mean I guess by definition you\u2019re reinvesting not only sort of in the growth result through the revenue, but you\u2019re also replacing the cost of construction. So other words, should we be thinking about the reinvestment in the buy business as the sum of adding back the stuff you took out from restructuring plus the investment in growth such that the investment is actually maybe higher than it looks like? If that\u2019s clear.","David Calhoun","","Yeah, I\u2019m not sure it is, but I\u2019ll describe for you at least the way we approach this thing. So our investments, there is clearly, reasonably big components of our investment, the capital and operating expenses in technology platforms that support the Buy business. I mean I think if you recall, we invested in AOD, a new technology platform, that\u2019s now up and running with three major clients, three of the most sophisticated ones in the world.","We still have the rest of our commercial enterprise and the rest of our platforms around the company to converge into AOD over time. So we have created an opportunity to restructure over time our business towards that end. All of that which improves both the cost position and the utility of the service that we provide. So \u2013 and we feel very good about that.","Now the size of restructuring amounts, i.e., the things that we do to accommodate now greater utilization of technology, et cetera. They do decline over time there is no question about it. This year actually we took a bigger chunk in restructuring than we probably intended a couple of years ago, simply because we were dealing with the European flat line, if you will, and we want to get ahead of it. So we actually accelerated a few things on that front. But as I think about pace of restructuring, it does decline over time. And it\u2019s mostly to accommodate sort of downsizing around a higher profile technology platform.","Brian West","","And to the timing, Todd, if you just \u2013 I pointed to 2011 where our accrual was around $84 million and cash out was around $82 million. So quarter-to-quarter there could be differences based on when you\u2019re required to book the charge versus actually when you need to pay it out and that will always be floating through the financials quarter-to-quarter. But over time obviously, they converge and typically on an annual basis, they get pretty closely aligned.","Elizabeth Zale","","Todd?","David Calhoun","","Todd, I hope (inaudible) on that.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","No, I wanted to be courteous to other people on the line.","David Calhoun","","Okay, thanks, Todd.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Robert Riggs of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair","","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a quick update on the ad solution business. How big is the contribution there, growth rates and is there anything in the pipeline over the next few quarters that we should keep an eye on that could accelerate the growth there? Thanks.","David Calhoun","","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. It is a focus within our Insight world, it\u2019s a couple of $100 million business for us. It\u2019s growing at a healthy double-digit pace. It will continue to do so. And, yes, we will probably do some small acquisitions in that space because they are out there, and because there are few platforms that we think can differentiate themselves in our world.","So we\u2019re going to move aggressively, continue to move aggressively into this space. We like it. It actually \u2013 it circles itself around this XCR metric TV and online ratings in a really interesting way and because of how we\u2019re situated with both the advertiser world, as well as the Watch world, we feel like we\u2019ve got a real advantage here in terms of reach. So yes, it\u2019s an emphasis, we\u2019ll continue to see probably disproportionate investment going its way and its performance so far has been terrific.","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair","","Great, thank you.","David Calhoun","","Yeah.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Rob. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from William Bird of Lazard. Please go ahead.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","","Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about what your growth expectations for developing markets for the balance of the year? And then, as we turn into 2013, I just want to get a sense of whether plus 30 to 50 basis points is likely to be kind of the margin formula? Thank you.","David Calhoun","","Yeah, so developing markets, let me just take that one straight up. Anybody who might have extrapolated 19% forever is wrong. That\u2019s not the way any of us have ever contemplated our investments there. Coming off a tough comp, recognizing that multinationals, which is still unfortunately the majority of our developing market business is that you\u2019ll recall. The way we set up these developing markets businesses, they start with a significant disproportionate share of multinationals. That\u2019s who get us started and local nationals began to build. There is no decline in the robustness of the local national interest in this product. That\u2019s going well, it\u2019s just a smaller part of the pie.","I do believe that the multinationals are going to stay selective here for a while, it\u2019s just their some trepidation around the world, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s life. But for us, these businesses will stay in that double-digit realm as the comps get a little easier, we\u2019ll probably increase somewhat. But I\u2019m not worried or intimidated at it being 11% in the first quarter, or even 16% in a different quarter. We feel very good about health of the business and that the prospects of it, and as local nationals become a significant \u2013 increasingly more significant part of our mix then that \u201ceconomic issue\u201d that surrounds multinationals I think will subside.","At any rate, that\u2019s a long way of saying I \u2013 I don\u2019t want to give you guidance towards the high side of double-digits, because I just don\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s not what we are betting on and it\u2019s not the way we run the company. We expect a double-digit performance out of our emerging markets year in and year out and feel good about that. It will \u2013 it could range, just like you\u2019ve seen, 11 to 19. That range doesn\u2019t intimidate us and I hope it doesn\u2019t intimidate you.","Brian West","","In terms of margin expansion, we love the fact that we get to reinvest 50 to 70 basis points in this particular calendar year. And we hope that is what the future brings us. On the other hand as we think about \u2013 right now we are simultaneously investing in three of the biggest markets in the world, Africa, China, India. And we won\u2019t be simultaneously investing in all of those three with this kind of intensity forever. And as we walk out of 2013 the investment intensity of those markets will subside. We completely hope there is something else it gets replaced by, but there will be a reduction in intensity of investments in that particular part of our business, no doubt about it.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","","And just from the CapEx perspective, are you likely to see CapEx come down in 2013 and if so how much?","Brian West","","Again, our governor of CapEx is always going to be our reinvestment ratio. So the range we have out there today keeps us in that governor, where we are never going to allow that ratio above one. Because our view is that, you never bring fresh capital on to the business faster than it was coming off in the form of operational D&A. And that\u2019s always going to be the governor and we like where we are at with that and we continue to be able to work and run the business in that kind of framework.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","","Thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Bill. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is that, as we\u2019ve talked about, due to that framework, it\u2019s not likely to rise. So I think that\u2019s important.","Brian West","","Yeah, it\u2019s not a function of revenue. It\u2019s really a function of that reinvestment ratio, very important to us because if you get too far afield of that, you have a long-term cost problem that we\u2019re not going to get into.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Bill. Next question, please?","Operator","","Our next question, and pardon the pronunciation, comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citibank","","Hi, thanks. Many of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to revisit \u2013 you said a couple of times in developing markets buys are staying selective. Is it selective by particular geographies or did you mean particular product lines? Could you provide some color on that?","David Calhoun","","Yeah, the truth is it\u2019s by client. When I think about sort of the phenomenon, we have some clients, who for lots of different reasons, could be performance or for other reasons, have just decided to be little more selective about how quickly they penetrate with new country category combinations, right, new products bringing to markets, et cetera. So that just happens. And it seems to, at least in our case, as we measure it, effects the Southeast Asian perimeter more so than the big countries China, India, et cetera.","So that\u2019s sort of our phenomena. But what I would say to you is that is pretty much client-centric. We have some clients who are still going gangbusters on that front, but if I tallied it at all up and aggregated it, some of the bigger ones are actually being a little more selective. And as a result, we just haven\u2019t seen the rate of penetration that they had been accustomed to the last couple of years. I just think there is some trepidation on global growth, that\u2019s all.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citibank","","And do you think local buyers, local regional companies step up any time to fill the gap?","David Calhoun","","Totally. Yeah, that\u2019s still very robust. It\u2019s just that for us it\u2019s still the smaller end of the stick, right, but that\u2019s still very robust. As they get comfortable with using data to support their businesses and enterprises \u2013 and remember, we\u2019re educating them on how to do it and what to do it with. But if you look at our resourcing, you\u2019ll find out that most of the people we\u2019re adding are actually being added to service, local nationals as opposed to multinationals. That\u2019s just that\u2019s the nature of the beast and that part of it\u2019s robust. And I can\u2019t wait until, as we\u2019ve talked many times in this call, that\u2019s more than half of the equation for us. When that happens, it gets very healthy.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citibank","","Okay. One last question. comScore\u2019s vCE product is it becoming more competitive to you guys as it evolves? Any commentary there?","David Calhoun","","More competitive? No. Look, it is a very different product, right? If you measure so \u201csample sizes\u201d or the metric itself, you\u2019ll find out that these are two wildly different products. We happen to have a product that looks like that one. And as I said to you, OCR is meant to displace it for us for us in our world. So no, I don\u2019t feel so much that way, they definitely have that viewability advantage in the \u2013 for the first couple of months but we\u2019ve taken care of that, in fact we think we have the viewability advantage. So \u2013 but that was really a smaller dimension of it. I think between demographic profile and reach of the metric itself, ours is significantly more advantaged.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citibank","","Okay, understood. Thank you, guys.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Ashwin. Next question, please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Bishop Cheen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bishop Cheen \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Hi, everyone. Thanks for all the updates. To the balance sheet, you guys have done a great job of extending all your maturities. There is \u2013 near term this year and next year maybe $900 million, I\u2019m rounding. Is that something you would just do with free cash flow and can you remind us again of your availability?","Brian West","","So, we\u2019ll provide some of the high coupon notes, we think about that all the time and what for us, what it means is that, as the markets stay robust and as every day gets closer to that call date, I\u2019m looking at it. And whether we do that with free cash flow or we refinance them, I have all options at my disposal and just know that we are focused on it. And that actually is going to be something that, as we think about the next 12 to 8 months, will materially reduce the weighted average interest costs of this company and we just can\u2019t wait for those things to come callable, or they get so attractive the economic NPV, we just do it.","Bishop Cheen \u2013 Wells Fargo","","And then your availability currently?","Brian West","","Availability in terms of our revolver capacity?","Bishop Cheen \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Yeah.","Brian West","","So we\u2019ve got a revolver that\u2019s, probably $688 million, we lean into a little bit as I mentioned, about $120 million as the seasonal cash flows would dictate, but we\u2019ve got plenty of capacity. For us, we view the capital markets as being very flexible to the Nielsen name and they\u2019ve been there before and we would expect them to be there in the future. But we don\u2019t really worry about it.","Bishop Cheen \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thanks, Bishop. Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Aaron Watts of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Aaron Watts \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Dave, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about a desire to march the company towards investment grade status. Curious, as you consider your various options for uses of cash going forward, investments obviously you\u2019ve laid out on this call, debt pay down, dividends, et cetera. Does achieving that IG status still remain a priority, and if so perhaps when you envision maybe getting there? Thanks.","David Calhoun","","Yeah, so I\u2019m still on the mission because that\u2019s what the company has been designed to do. As everyone has noted our free cash flow is getting better and better every day that goes by. I don\u2019t see a big change with respect to acquisition philosophy has nothing to do with our desire, we\u2019re always desirous of good acquisitions. It\u2019s just within our space they tend to be small, they tend to be add on, they tend to be tuck-in, we are going continue down that path and you will see, we will continue to do it in mostly the measured way we have so far. So I don\u2019t see breakout things going on there, at least at this stage of our life.","As we get closer and closer to that investment-grade status, there is always an economic trade-off that I\u2019ll rely on Brian to evaluate day in and day out, and we\u2019ll always be efficient with respect to what we do for shareholders. So \u2013 but that decision set for us is still a little way off, I consider a couple of the hurdles to be the retirement of these high-priced notes. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019d just like to get done because there is a real economic advantage in getting that done sooner rather than later. At any rate that\u2019s, again, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving it open ended for you but I guess the real message is no change in my objective or my philosophy or the way we are running the place at this stage.","Aaron Watts \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","That\u2019s helpful, perfect. Thank you.","Elizabeth Zale","","Thank you, Aaron. Before we close, I just want to make sure that everyone is aware we have a number of investor events that are coming up in May. Our annual shareholder meeting is Tuesday, May 8, we will be participating in the JPMorgan TMT Conference on Tuesday, May 15 and also the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Conference on May 24. We\u2019ve published our first annual review, year in review, in print and online versions, which you can access on our website at ir.nielsen.com. And we look forward to the opportunity to connect with all of you in the investment community through these and other events throughout the second quarter. With that, we\u2019ll say thank you and turn it back to the operator.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes the Nielsen Holdings N.V. First Quarter 2012 Call.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Zale, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Liz Zale","Thank you. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Financial Performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is David Calhoun, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations and prospects.

A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website, again at ir.nielsen.com.","We use certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the results of our operations. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results of operations. Further definition and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our results under GAAP is available at the end of our press release. It is also in the Appendix of the webcast slide presentation we're using on today's call and on our IR website.","For today's call, Dave will start with a brief summary of our results and accomplishments for 2012 and will provide a business update, then Brian will discuss financials for the full year and fourth quarter and more details on our capital allocation priorities and will provide our full year guidance for 2013. Following that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, David Calhoun.","David L. Calhoun","Thanks, Liz. Good afternoon, everyone. So I'll go over our first page, give you a quick summary of what I think was a very solid year for the Nielsen Company, particularly with respect to some of the strategic wins that occurred over the course of the year. But let's begin with the financial results.","Revenue grew 1% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. This narrowly missed the low end of our range. And while we saw a real order uptick at the very end of that quarter, it just was too late to close on the low end of the range itself.","Underlying that, we had very strong growth in our recurring revenue business, this is the information part of our business. And saw a continued pressure throughout the year on the Insights business. Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. Again, this margin expansion reflects sort of the scale model and in particular, the growth of our Information business which, of course, is the healthy and most scalable of our products. And then finally, adjusted net income grew 19% on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. Again, the additional leverage on the basis of deleveraging our balance sheet.","Importantly, we have talked about being very clear on our capital allocation strategy. January 31, our board adopted a dividend policy with an initial yield of 2% and a first payment in the first quarter of this calendar year. That dividend payment will be $0.16 per share. Importantly, for everyone on the call, we remain on a path toward investment grade when we need to access the financial market. And so we have not given up on that as an objective, and we think the timing works well.","Everyone knows we announced the negotiation of a deal with Arbitron. It adds another 2 hours of media coverage with our customer base here across the United States. We're excited by it. It is in the regulatory process and we'll give you a little bit of an update, I think, on that in the Q&A. And then with respect to 2013 guidance, Brian will get into it, but it's very much in line with our long-term framework, with accelerating earnings and cash flow growth over that period.","If you'll flip the page, I don't usually do this, but I think it's important to do. We had some very -- really significant accomplishments over the course of 2012 with respect to sort of stage-setting for future. First, huge increase in U.S. retail coverage. Again, this is always important to all of our clients, but with Wal-Mart, it was the single biggest increase in retail coverage in recent history. We expanded our coverage in Africa, in India, in China where all of the future population growth resides. Critically important to us to get a big leadership position, so that we can get the most of those markets as they develop. We extended several long-term client relationships. In fact, all that were due. But importantly, contract terms with respect to tenure, are the longest that we've accomplished in our history.","We launched a solution to increase local TV coverage, product we refer to as the hybrid, but it addresses an age-old issue with respect to ratings stability, and it's in effect as we go throughout this year. We expanded our TV and digital internationally. We won in Hong Kong, we won in the Ukraine, we won in the Czech Republic, we won online in Germany, so all of these things are good and important for us in the year ahead. We commercialized 2 very innovative products in the digital space, that being OCR and XCR. We continue to nurture them, we feel great about their progress. We believe that the OCR product has become the standard for video, and that was our -- certainly our primary objective.","We acquired Social Guide, and more importantly, signed a deal with Twitter to begin the measurement of Social TV ratings. This will be the first chance we have to basically marry earned media with paid media. There's something in it for everybody. If you're a media company, it's the extension of audience, if you're an advertisers, it is the amplification effect that you get with earned media. So a big deal for us and I think an important future.","We accelerated the growth of our ad solutions business with Vizu, an important product for online advertisers in measuring brand effect. We commercialized Nielsen Catalina Solutions, which was an investment we started over 3 years ago. And finally, we signed our agreement to acquire Arbitron. So lots of accomplishments, I think very important stage setting for the years ahead and something we all feel great about.","I'm going to turn it over to Brian before we get to Q&A to give you some of the financial details.","Brian J. West","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm on Page 9, total results for Nielsen fiscal year 2012. 2012 was another strong year for the company. It's our sixth year of consistent revenue growth in the mid-single digits and expanding margins. For the full year, revenue was $5.6 billion, that's up 4% constant currency. Revenue came in a little light versus our expectations due to the short cycle. Insights orders just didn't quite close in time for year-end, as Dave mentioned.","Our full year adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 billion, that's up 6% constant currency, and margin expanded 49 basis points at the high end of our range, driven by favorable business mix. Exchange rates impacted our reported results. There was a 250 basis point drag on revenue and a 210 basis point drag on EBITDA for the year. Adjusted net income was $704 million, that's up a very strong 23% constant currency, and better than expected. And our adjusted net income per share was $1.87, also better than expected. Finally, our net debt ratio was 3.75x, down a quarter turn versus prior year.","Moving on to Page 10, I'll go into the fourth quarter itself. The fourth quarter was our 25th consecutive year of quarter growth. The fourth quarter revenue was $1.464 billion, up 4% constant currency. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $457 million, that's up 6% constant currency, and margins expanded 81 basis points.","Exchange rates also impacted the fourth quarter, reported results, there was a 60 basis point drag on revenue, a 40 basis point drag on EBITDA. Adjusted net income was $234 million, again up a very strong 24%, and adjusted net income per share was $0.62. Cash flow accelerated in the quarter and we generated over $200 million in free cash flow and that's up 37% over prior year.","Moving on to the Page 11, segment revenue for the fourth quarter. Total Buy revenue in the quarter was $920 million, that's up 3% constant currency. The biggest part of the Buy business is Information Services, which represents about 75% of the total segment. That was up 8% constant currency. These are the revenues that are under long-term contracts and that are growing as a result of the investments that we choose to make in expanding our coverage of the consumer, both in the U.S. and in the developing world.","The smaller part of Buy, Insights was down 8%. We saw pressure on this more discretionary part of the business. We did begin to see order momentum through the quarter, we just couldn't get it all in. In the developing markets, we're up 6%, with local clients accelerating nicely, offset by select global clients who are more cautious on the discretionary side. Our total developing markets for 2012 grew 7%.","The Watch segment revenue was $527 million, that's up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in both the U.S. and international markets. Our legacy online products was in the middle of a transition as we move out of certain services and move on to our digital properties and our Ad Solutions business saw nice momentum. Finally, Expositions revenue came in at $70 million, that's down 19%. And this is basically the -- driven by the timing of trade shows between quarters. Not a lot happens in the fourth quarter, for the full year, Expositions had positive overall growth on revenue, up 2%.","Moving on to Page 12, profitability. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $457 million, that's up 6% constant currency; Buy came in at $220 million, up 1%; Watch was $234 million, up 11%; and Expos was $3 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 81 basis points, which is up sequentially and year-over-year. Buy margins reflected our continued investments in expanding coverage, while the Watch margins reflect the scalable nature of our business. Overall, we're able to deliver on productivity initiatives, which allowed us to reinvest for long-term growth and expand margins in the quarter and for the full year.","Moving on to Page 13, the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow for the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $207 million, CapEx came in at $133 million, cash taxes of $36 million and restructuring was $50 million. The balance sheet, net debt ended at just a bit over $6 billion, and our net debt ratio was down to 3.75x, a reduction of 0.25 point and we paid down $190 million of debt in the year.","I'd also point out -- on our capital table. We refinanced -- I'm sorry, we extended the maturity of $1.2 billion of our term loan to 2017 at L plus 225. We refinanced $800 million of legacy high coupon notes from a 10% blended rate to 4.5%. And this all reflected -- is -- was reflected on our weighted average interest rate, which is at 4.86%, and it's lower by a little over 80 basis points year-on-year.","Two items I would note with regard to the $4.1 billion of loan debt we have. $1.2 billion of this will have the benefit of a rate step down from L plus 225 to L plus 200 in 2013, based on hitting certain leverage targets. And we will be in the market tomorrow, February 12, to reprice up to $2.9 billion of our bank debt based on the favorable market conditions that we see. So overall, it was good year of continuing our policy of de-risking and delevering the balance sheet.","Page 14, Capital Allocation. Because of all this work and the milestones we got through in the course of 2012, it's now given us the opportunity to define what our capital allocation policy was -- is going to be, going forward. I'll remind everyone, our priorities start with investing in our business for growth, both organically and on an acquired basis, as we continue our tuck-in strategy. We'll also look to pay down debt and then return capital to shareholders, as Dave mentioned, through the adoption of our dividend policy, which is initially a 2% yield. The quarterly dividend of $0.16 will start payment in the first quarter 2013, and it's a range where we could commit to our annual growth expectations.","From a target capital structure standpoint, we believe the range of 2.75x to 3x net debt-to-EBITDA is where this is -- where we're on a road to get to, which we believe gets us to the investment grade goal ahead of our 2016 to 2018 refinancing needs, as you can see in the maturity stack on the right-hand side of this chart. We really are a new issuer of any debt for some time, and this gives the confidence to begin returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of the dividend to maximize overall shareholder return.","And finally, the last page for me, Page 15, 2013 guidance. 2013 full year revenue will be up 4.0% to 5.0% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins will expand between 40 and 60 basis points constant currency. If FX rates stay where they were as of last Friday, February 8, for the entire full year, we would see an 80 basis point benefit in revenue and a 65 basis point benefit in adjusted EBITDA. Our estimates by quarter are included in the appendix of this presentation.","Adjusted income growth is estimated at plus-13% to 17% constant currency, and the adjusted net income per share on a reported basis, including FX as of last Friday's rates, is $2.13 to $2.19 per share. And as I mentioned, the initial dividend yield is 2% and we expect to delever by 0.3 turns.","There's also some housekeeping items at the bottom of the chart. CapEx estimate, in the range of $350 million to $360 million; depreciation, amortization, $525 million to $535 million; net book interest of $335 million to $340 million; cash taxes of $145 million to $155 million; cash restructuring at $60 million to $80 million; and the estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding for FY 2013 is around 379 million shares.","With that, I will turn it over to Dave.","David L. Calhoun","Just one comment before we break for Q&A, and that's with respect to the planning environment and the revenue growth targets. It's a narrower range than what we'd normally do, but to be honest, we don't see anything in this economic environment that would suggest we might break to the upside, and therefore, we didn't. And so that's going to be to the planning horizon that we see, at least in the immediate future, and that's the -- it gives us a wonderful path to invest and do all the things we need to do for the long term.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Dave. Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Brian, you mentioned about accelerated free cash flow conversion. Could you go over what's driving that? And if you could give us a sense of headwinds and tailwinds on free cash flow as we look at 2013?","Brian J. West","A big part of it is all the work we've done about reducing the interest burden of the company. You saw it in a multiple ways in 2012. Taking out those high coupon notes was a big deal, so that's a big driver of it. In terms of our headwinds into 2013 on cash flow, this business model holds up real well, and we'll have nice conversion. And we think that we've got a reasonable outlook in terms of what the capital market will look like in the corresponding interest environment. So we feel really good about no real big things out there that would impact as. And as Dave mentioned, we've got a business operating plan that's set for a playing environment that's not expecting big accelerations, so we feel pretty comfortable about where we're at.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","How about a working capital comment as it refers to free cash flow in 2013?","Brian J. West","Yes, first, working capital is really in line with volume, if you really look at it over a longer period of time. And that will never change. We -- our real working capital is all about collections and receivables. We don't have inventory, there's not big things that suck up cash in that front of the balance sheet, which again, means that we have the high cash flow conversion doing the business model. So we feel good that anything would be more along volume impact, which we think is a good thing, because that means revenue's growing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler, Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm sure it's going to be on the Q, but can you be a little more explicit on what the constant currency revenue growth number was in the quarter, it seems that it didn't have a decimal on it?","Brian J. West","The constant currency revenue growth for the fourth quarter?","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, yes.","Brian J. West","The 4% number I mentioned?","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, it was like 4, 2 or 3, 8...","Brian J. West","Oh, the exact number was 3.5.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","3.5, okay. And then just on the -- just a little bit more explicit on the commentary around not getting some of that short-order revenue to book by the year end. Should we expect that it'd be, expecting a catch-up in that in the first quarter, or is it just a flow through?","Brian J. West","Put it this way, we believe that the Insights business, we've seen bottom, and we already feel things getting better with momentum. So that's kind of what we're talking about. And again, it's a narrow part of the business, and Matt, you know better than anybody, this business grows at mid single digits year in, year out. And what we're talking about playing for is that which is, at times, a little harder to call. But as we exited the year, orders felt pretty good, and we don't think we're going to see -- we're confident we're going to not going to see continued rates of this Insights that we've seen in the second half of 2012.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just I guess, sort of a bigger picture question, around expanding your capabilities to cover -- to follow audiences as they migrate across platforms. As you get [indiscernible] to the results calls this season, a lot of companies are talking about being able to measure streaming. Maybe just an update on what your plans are for rolling out streaming capabilities. And then, just in general, is this going to incremental revenue to Nielsen, when you're able to deliver those services to clients or is that kind of part of the package?","David L. Calhoun","It's more or less part of the package. Yes, it's incremental, but in the total scheme of things, it's -- I don't think you're going to notice big differences. We will measure streaming, so -- and we will cover it around all devices. To be honest with you, the technology of the metric itself is not hard. It's usually getting the industry interest to align themselves as to who gets credit. And -- so I'm confident that the answer will be had and it will be a Nielsen answer, and it will gradually find its way into the, sort of the commercially acceptable currency. But it's not going to happen in a day. I do like where we are, and I think we'll be at the leading edge of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Karimzad at Goldman Zachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you mentioned that you find record-long duration on some of the renewals. Was that in the Watch or the Buy side of the business?","David L. Calhoun","Buy side retail measurements, market share, all those things that go into that. Those are the sort of the real underlying strength of the company. The fact that, that's been getting longer and longer I think, reflects that sticky nature.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean on one side, though, you've historically had some 5, 7 years long? Have you seen that change over the last couple years as  [indiscernible] is going to become [indiscernible] ?","David L. Calhoun","No, very consistent, very consistent.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- I guess, help us reconcile a bit, your comment that you don't see upside in the planning environment, but then, Brian, you're saying there was some momentum coming out of the fourth quarter on discretionary side, so I'm assuming you haven't baked in any acceleration whatsoever in the revenue guide. But given what you saw late in the fourth quarter, why wouldn't you consider that possibility?","David L. Calhoun","It's short cycle. So look at -- short cycles come and go, and I don't want to make the same mistake I'd made in the calendar year 2012. So this is the planning environment we have. There's nothing in the world I'd like more than to break to the upside, it's just that I'm not going to plan on it.","Brian J. West","I would add to that, we, as I mentioned, we think we've seen bottom in Insights, so it's not getting worse.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Then in, on the emerging market side, so the local guys sound like they're picking up some -- in any of those large multinationals, the Western based ones, have you seen any hints, kind of over the next couple of quarters that they might be changing their tune, or was it pretty much the same story as you're speaking to them?","David L. Calhoun","I don't think they'll be the drawdown that we saw in the middle part of the year, with respect to the multinational interests in the developing markets. I wouldn't say they're sort of moving back to robust, but I don't think we'll see the drawdowns.","Operator","Comes from Suzi Stein at Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about some of the major investment initiatives over the last year. How much of those are included in the 4% to 5% growth for fiscal '13? Or is there upside, possibly from some of those initiatives?","David L. Calhoun","Suzi, I wouldn't count on upside. I've learned with the OCR development, which I am still extremely excited about, and where it's positioned, and how it's going. These things just take time, so social media, which is very exciting for me, I think for every marketer, it's just going to take time in terms of building the use case around it. Ultimately, who pays for what and how that gets sorted out. And so we want to make sure we do it right, give ourselves time. But of the things we've done in the last several years, I think this deal with Twitter and what earned media looks like alongside paid media, is going to have reasonably big implications, but I'm not in a predictive mode yet.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, can you just give a little bit more color on the Arbitron deal? Has there been any response from customers and also, maybe just remind us of the next steps in terms of the regulatory process and an update on your view of the timing of close?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, let me do my best. So I think you know, we're in the regulatory review process as we speak. We're fully engaged, we're educating each other with all the right questions. So far, no surprises, nothing around those questions that gives us any cause for concern. We made a conscious choice to pull and refile so that we'd have another 30 days to again educate both sides of the table on how to think about it. And we're not really handicapping the outcome with respect to a second request either, so we're just going to take it as it is. We still love the deal in every way, shape or form. I've gotten really good feedback from the marketplace, and particularly from the radio side of this, mostly built around the notion of ROI metrics and reaction metrics, as we call, that demonstrate the effectiveness of radio as an advertising medium. So I really do think there's positive momentum on that side. I don't think I'm looking through rose-colored glasses. I'm excited about the deal and the regulatory process. It is what it is, and everybody's just paying attention and walking our way through it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Boyer, Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The developing markets, saw an uptick there in your revenue growth. Can you just give us kind of your expectations for that market for the year? Are we still talking, probably the mid single digit range, you think, for '13?","Brian J. West","Well, first of all, the developing markets believe [ph] it or not, is growing faster than the total, right, and that's reflected in the numbers. We think it's a good thing, and that's licensed by local clients that are small books of business but ones that are growing really fast. Anyway, so I -- we -- that actually over indexed the overall growth rate.","David L. Calhoun","So anyway, yes, I plan for and we'll continue to invest for double-digit growth in the developing markets. The quarters and the years roll out the way they do, but I'm still optimistic that we can deliver on that. And, I -- China feels like it might be regaining some momentum. India has been consistent, and we go in with some momentum into the year. Africa is just going to take a while for that market to develop. But again, I feel good about it. I'm investing for it to grow double digits. That's how we think about it.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just as far as the Buy and Watch segments, the breakdown of revenue growth for '13. Should it be, along the same types of levels as we saw in '12?","Brian J. West","We don't break out guidance by segment. But, you'll do your own interrogation of what we've looked at historically, and you'll be able to gauge that for 4% to 5% guidance, and we'll let you come at your own answer. But we feel really good about both sides of these big franchises that just be -- they're resilient in and out any cycle and very nice growth in that mid-single-digit range.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, well, along those lines then, anything other than Wal-Mart in the first half within your Information business that we should be thinking about, as far as moving pieces?","David L. Calhoun","Probably no single annual moment like that. You know that, that being an information component, that it's recurring. Market share, with respect to last year, was definitely in favor of Nielsen. How that plays out over the course of the year and years ahead, I don't want to project. But given the fact that I know we gained some reasonable market share over the course of last year, there has to be some resilience to that, some added value there.","Operator","Next question comes from Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Your margin guidance for 2013 is a bit higher than what we've seen before. Are there areas where you're either pulling back on spend or some incremental investments spend is ending?","Brian J. West","No, not all. We still view -- we've talked about being in full investment mode to do all the things we want to do in the name of long-term growth. And that's all still complicated in the margin guidance expansion for 2013. The last couple of years, we've been expanding margins, call it around 50 basis points. We don't see anything different to that in 2013 while still being able to do everything we want to do, around investing for the long term.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on recent calls, you've broken out some more details in Buy in terms of Europe versus the U.S. and growth rates or declines, could give us more detail there?","David L. Calhoun","I'll just -- maybe state the obvious here. Europe has been -- we're in the third year of a, sort of a flat world, and I don't expect it to jump up at all. So our information business -- the good news is, the -- as is usually the case, the information part of what we do holds up beautifully, so it's flat to up a couple of points. And then the Insight business, which has been depressed in Europe now for a while is going to stay there. So we have no -- we got nothing in our plan that suggests that any rebound in Europe -- and, of course, the U.S. has been a reasonably robust place for us, especially with respect to the information part of the thing, and I don't see breakout to an upside, but I do expect continued good performance in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Bank at RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Couple of follow-ups on the OCR and XCR initiatives. We tend use them almost interchangeably. And I guess I wonder, are we sort of closer to broader market adoption and revenue generation for either, or do you see the timeframe as the same? Because you'd think that because XCR is cross-platform, there would be greater complexity on lots of levels? And then, the second related question is, you guys have been talking about how it seems to be less about technology than more to be about industry structure, almost. But I think for today, your online ratings are mostly coming -- they're sort of PC-based, as opposed to tablet and mobile, I think. And is that a technology issue, or is it more a service industry structural?","Brian J. West","Yes, good. So the latter first, it's industry structural, and it will get resolved within the Nielsen context, so I -- and I feel good about that, I really do. With respect to the discussion OCR, XCR, again, a reminder, the big value-added component and the big investment that we made is really OCR. A much more robust metric that can be delivered everyday that actually a publisher is willing to guarantee and ultimately deliver audience against. That's something new and different relative to the way the industry was previously served, and it adds enormous value. XCR becomes a matter of convenience, mostly for the use community. And for us, that is still being developed, because the use community has, if they have both metrics, they get to do what they want with them. If they have a single metric, well then they could combine them and maybe there is some efficiency in it, but I want to make sure the relative value is understood of the metrics. OCR is a brand-new thing delivering brand-new stuff to the marketplace, and then XCR makes up sort of a matter of convenience for certain users who want to go across. So I feel good about both, but there is a real difference in the way we think about them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Doug Arthur at Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, I mean realizing you've got a couple, still some regulatory steps in Arbitron, now that you've had a chance to take a closer look at puts and takes on it, in terms of how it fits into the Nielsen platform, is there anything you can share with us as an update?","Brian J. West","We negotiated this deal, believing it was a really good thing for Nielsen, and I still believe, based on everything we know, it's a really good deal. I'm going to end up being a real proponent for radio, both in terms of the effectiveness of the medium in the advertising world, and how it should be scored against other mediums. And so I feel good about that, and believe we can add value to the radio clients. The clients, as the question earlier asked, have been actually very supportive of Nielsen's role in radio and our ability to tie buy side data to the radio advertising medium. That's what we're attempting to do. And then separately, as expected, my international community, as in Nielsen people serving overseas markets, just can't wait to understand what Arbitron has, so that they can bring it to all their local markets. So this part of the puzzle is working out, I think very well. I'm very optimistic.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Juenger at Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm sorry to do this to you guys again, but I must be missing something on the revenue, so I'd love it if I could just go through again. So you grew 4% constant currency in fiscal year '12, and then if we're looking to the next year at 4% or 5%, if I compare the good guys and bad guys, so we have a 0.5 year at Wal-Mart coming in next year again, which I think should be sort of similar, year-over-year. You have Insights, which sounds like you think has bottomed out, had a pretty bad, relatively not good year in fiscal year '12, so that should, on its own, make things a little better than in fiscal year '12, and it sounds like International, if anything, is accelerating a little bit. If I put all that together, I mean, it sounds like it should either be higher, or maybe I'm missing another risk? Or perhaps, are these longer-term contracts you're signing, maybe you're trading a little lower growth rate in turn for the extra years, or you're just being conservative?","David L. Calhoun","Well, I hope you're right. Listen, I'd -- make no mistake. A lot of stuff happens over the course of the year. I am definitely influenced by an environment I just don't think it's all that healthy. I think there's a lot of things that are sort of going to go on over the course of the year in the macro environments. I have more confidence in consumers' outlook than I do my clients, and so that's really where it resides. And I just missed the guidance last year, so call me crazy, but I'm trying to learn from my mistakes.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, fair enough. Let me ask you one quick follow-up, if you don't mind. So in the past years, I think you've made a statement like something like 70% of your revenue is booked sort of going into the year. Correct me if I'm wrong, I wonder if that's still about the same this year, and sort of like what work is left to do in terms of rounding out the year?","David L. Calhoun","So, yes, that is true. We start every year with about 70% of our revenue with high visibility. And really, what you're always playing for is that Insights business, which we've talked about a few times, largely speaking, so nothing's changed and we still have quite a bit of visibility. And then that is reflective in this very steady, mid single-digit growth business that reflects those long-term contracts and that high visibility, so nothing's changed on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington at Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A quick question for you on the Insights business. What's driving the improvement there? Is it 1 or 2 clients or broad-based? And, does it signal a shift for the CPG companies from margin preservation to revenue growth?","David L. Calhoun","To be honest with you, I think the biggest shift was some adjustments that a couple of clients made with respect to how much Insight work they do. And particularly around the world, I think those adjustments are now behind us and behind them, and now they're just sort of back to building. This wasn't a share issue in any way, shape or form. This was a, sort of a market issue, and I think more than anything, because we've had lots of clients growing at very healthy rates in the midst of last year's dismal performance on that -- in that way. So I just think the couple of adjustments that occurred are behind us. Otherwise, it's a pretty robust market as of today, but I just remind you, it's short -- it is short cycle, and it is what it is.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then you've become the standard in online video measurement. What's the next milestone for OCR? Is it to move into display? Or, what do you think?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, that has to extend itself across display, and it's got to become vital to the planning and optimization platforms that exist. And so that product development is continuous. We're clear-headed about what we want to get done. We're still in the development mode, but I still feel confident and believe that OCR is the right answer for this digital market.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","How about the potential for the Buy business to begin to move online?","David L. Calhoun","As in measuring online purchase behavior?","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Correct.","David L. Calhoun","It does. Not -- the real question is, how quickly do we get huge data providers to jump in the co-op network. So before that happens, we will always represent that online shopping environment. We do it with our panels and other means, but eventually, we're going to have to convince big players to contribute data, so that the market fully understands. I'm confident that, that will happen. It only took us how many years to get Wal-Mart in the offline world. So I'm confident it will happen, it just takes time. In the meantime, we will represent it as best we can, and the market so far, has purchased that kind of data. So anyway, I feel good about it, I think we'll be on the leading edge, but they're going to get those co-op decisions when they make them, and my job is not to rush them, it's just to keep educating them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen at Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Just a couple little -- on dust-ups here. Could you repeat, please, what you said about refinancing some bank debt? I just missed the comment, you mentioned something for tomorrow. Secondly, could you just comment on tax, given a lot of adjusting items and so forth, your tax rate moves around a lot. Should we still just be using a 35%-ish rate, going forward? And lastly, do you have anything to comment on, in terms of your financial backers, perhaps selling down some more of the shares, as we move forward?","Brian J. West","That'll start -- regarding tomorrow, I'm glad you asked that. The debt markets are very attractive right now, and we're going to take the opportunity to reprice up to $2.9 billion of our term loan. So, look forward to that when we execute, but that's what we're going to do tomorrow. And we expect, if the market holds, we'll be beneficiary to that in our interest expense going forward. In terms of taxes, the tax rate, for us, important distinction between book rate and cash tax rate. The book rate is always going to be reflective of some noise, with some ins and outs that aren't really reflective of the economic underlying performance. We've always pointed folks towards our cash taxes, which in 2012 ended up at around a 15% rate. And we've spoken before that, that long-term range is going to be in the low-20s, and we continue to have that posture. And that rate will gradually move up, but it's going to start from a 15% in 2012 and move towards that low-20s. 35% is just a book rate, which is a bunch of noise in it, as you mentioned, really focus on our cash taxes. With respect to sponsors and their interest, they -- I guarantee you, they'll let us know when they want to move. And right now, I've got nothing to say about it.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Okay. Would you mind if I just follow up quickly on the bank numbers? I assume that, that any refile that you do is included in your guidance statement, is that right?","Brian J. West","No.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","It's not, okay.","Brian J. West","Everything we have out there is what we see in our hand today. Any benefit will come back and provide more once we get that one done, but there's nothing in there that contemplates that, one way or the other.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Okay. But we could assume that your book interest rate will go down, as of perhaps tomorrow, given the numbers you're putting in your guidance statement today?","Brian J. West","Well, we're going to launch the transaction, I hope so. It will take a few days for it to close, but that's the intent.","Operator","The next question comes from William Bird at Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","What are your thoughts on growing the dividend over time as you deleverage? Should we think of Nielsen as like a single-digit dividend grower, or something more than that?","David L. Calhoun","I don't want to get into projecting that now, I'll let Brian comment, if he likes. We will grow it with a consistent performance of the company's growth rates, and that's our intention. And we will always make -- we'll always hold out our objective to get to investment grade, when the time is right for us to refinance certain things. So I don't want to get into a sort of a conjecture at this moment, but if our model continues to produce at the kind of rate it does today, it'll be that kind of growth rate.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And as a follow-on, when would you hope to address the 2016 maturity wall?","Brian J. West","Well, the good news is, it's because that's 3 years away, we've got time on our side. And we're going to, we -- as you can tell from the last year, 2 years, 6 years, we've been very active in the capital markets, opportunistic when we needed to be, and consistent with our policy to take leverage down and de-risk by extending maturities and lowering interest rates. That's not going to change. We'll always have that mindset. But again, we're not compelled to do anything, because we've got time on our side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Flynn at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of sort of maintenance questions. First of all, would you mind giving us the segment revenue growth rates out to 1 decimal place, that would be very helpful for Watch, Buy and then Info and Insights.","Brian J. West","Why don't you ask your next question and then I'll work on getting that. I'm sure you've got another one.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just the cash tax rate, I think you just referenced this in an answer to a prior question. I just want to clarify the, 15% for 2012, the 1 from 2013, what rate is that, exactly, that you're expecting? And then over what period of time do you expect it'll ratchet back up to the low-20s?","David L. Calhoun","It's going to modestly move up, and it's going to gradually get to that low-20 perspective. I don't know whether that's going to be a point a year or not, it depends on the business mix, among other things. But right now, we think we've done some planning, opportunistically, that has that at the rate we think is very attractive. And moving toward 20% we think is a good thing, and somewhat consistent with what we've always talked about. In terms of the segment revenues, Kelly, you want fourth quarter?","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Brian J. West","The fourth quarter, the Buy business was plus 3.4%; Information, plus 7.7%; and Insights, down 7.5%. Obviously, all those on constant currency. Watch was up 4.8%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Weiser at Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Two questions: One on social media, just a monetization of the SocialGuide product. I just wanted to see if you had any thoughts about how big you think that opportunity is, maybe by the time you've launched the Nielsen Twitter TV ratings or other analytics products around this? Dimensionalizing, do you see $100 million, $10 million, anything like that? And a second, unrelated question, I saw this news about the -- extending the deal with Tata, I guess from $1 billion agreement to $2.5 billion agreement, and extending the duration. I'm just wondering, does that lead to any extra restructuring charges? Just suggests to me that there's a lot more work that they'll be doing, so curious about any other implications from that agreement?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, I'll start with the social media one. Look, I don't want to get into sort of how big could it be, because it's such at an early stage. I will say in my lifetime in this industry, I get more questions around the paid media metric than almost any -- paid versus earned media, versus almost anything. There's a genuine interest on the part of all marketers to somehow capture the earned media part of it and place advertising in the right places so that earned media can be maximized. That's what this metric is meant to do. It sets aside the paid media television metric and says, if I put it on advertising on this program, the likelihood of a big earn media component is high. So I know that an advertiser, if he's confident that, that will happen, will buy more advertising on that particular program. And the media side of it will want to promote in a significant way, the earned media opportunity, if advertising is put in their medium. So in many ways, I'm going to try to serve every client I do today, but I'm going to try to give them something different, something better. And I think there's a high likelihood, one they'll be interested, they know everyone else is interested, and they're likely to pay me for it. I just don't want to get, at this moment in time, as we're getting ready to launch the first addition to project just how big. I'm confident, I like it, the economics and the model that underlie it are actually very attractive. So we got plenty of time to get this right and build the use case the right way. With respect to Tata, I think the right way to think about it is that most of this growth in the relationship is already embedded in the work we're doing together, in the continuing progress that they've made with us in servicing our needs. It's a -- they've been a spectacular partner for us. Everywhere in the world, as we built this scale model, they've been a big part of it. And so I feel good about it. There's not much on the risk side for anyone to think about. The numbers sounds big, but we've always been way ahead of that set of numbers, and I believe we will continue to be. They've been a terrific partner.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] ","I would now like to hand the conference over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Thanks, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's third quarter financial performance and the outcome of our strategic review. I'm joined by Chairman Jim Attwood; our CEO, David Kenny; and our CFO and COO, Dave Anderson. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind all of you that our remarks and responses to your questions today may contain forward-looking statements, including those about Nielsen's outlook and prospects that are based on Nielsen's current expectations. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC, which are available on our website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.","On today's call, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, which is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at Nielsen.com. [Operator Instructions]","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, David Kenny.","David Kenny","Thanks, Sara. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call today. Let me run through the key agenda items. First, as we've all been waiting the outcome of our strategic review, following an extensive review process. The Board of Nielsen concluded that separating our businesses, Nielsen Global Media and Nielsen Global Connect into two independent publicly traded companies is the best path to position each of our businesses for long term success and to maximize more value.","Since we began that review over a year ago, both businesses have improved their products and their operating discipline. We are confident that by creating two independent companies, the separation will accelerate our improvement and allow each of these businesses to pursue their unique operational and strategic priorities.","In conjunction with the strategic review we also reviewed our capital allocations framework and both Jim and Dave will talk more about this. And then I'll come back to talk about the path forward for Nielsen Global Media and Nielsen Global Connect. After that, Dave is going to review our financial opportunity for each business and then review our third quarter results, which once again reflects strong execution by our associates around the world.","I am happy to say that both Media and Connect revenue were ahead of our expectations and adjusted EBITDA is on track. We are reiterating revenue, margin and free cash flow guidance and we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. This solid performance is a testament to our associates around the world who focus on execution every day. I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication. Given the strategic review, our remarks will be longer than normal today and we will stay on to take your questions.","We believe that both Media and Connect will be better served by operating independently. Let me explain. Media and Connect are each essential to the markets they serve, the Media and advertizing sector and the retail and FMCG economies respectively. These are fundamentally different businesses with different financial profiles, different people, different tech needs and different end markets. Each of the businesses is undergoing a transformation, but they take different forms and require unique investment and focus.","In Media, Nielsen is the leading global independent arbiter of truth and the established trading currency across the media landscape with a growing global footprint across a $600 billion advertizing market. These media markets are changing rapidly and we must continue to invest to drive our digital transformation and global adoption. Media is a scalable, largely syndicated business with a high level of recurring revenue and attractive margins.","In Connect, Nielsen provides critical market share measurement and analytics to FMCG manufacturers and their retailers. Connect is the only provider with a truly global footprint supporting $7 trillion in global grocery spend across over a 100 markets. We have been investing in initiatives such as the Nielsen Connect Platform and retailer collaboration and those investments have strengthened our competitive position. We are also investing in backend efficiencies and automation to drive productivity, speed and quality.","Operating these as two separate companies will put each team in a much stronger position to drive decision making with velocity, respond to changing market demands and push key initiatives forward to better serve our clients and accelerate their transformations. I am very excited about the opportunities in both businesses and I remain focused on both businesses. After the separation, I will remain the CEO of the Media business.","In the meantime we have begun a search for the Connect CEO and we have since some internal candidates as well as external candidates. Meanwhile Dave is going to focus his COO time as COO of Connect to ensure that it is fully prepared for a successful spin while continuing his CFO duties across the entire enterprise. We will update you on other key management and governance developments in due course.","Let me now turn the call over to Jim on behalf of the Board, so that he can provide further insight into the strategic review aspects.","Jim Attwood","Thank you, David. On behalf of the Board we've been very pleased with the Nielsen leadership team over the past year. Under David and Dave's leadership we've seen a strong track record of execution with improving fundamental and increased financial and operating discipline to drive greater accountability. With the support of the leadership team and our outside advisors we've had a very active and comprehensive strategic review process, which also included an in-depth analysis of our businesses, strategies and market opportunities. ","We evaluated a broad range of alternatives, including continuing to operate as a public independent company, a separation of the businesses, and the sale of the entire company. The Board unanimously concluded that separating Nielsen's two businesses is the best path forward to enhance strategic focus, growth and long-term shareholder value.","As independent companies, both Nielsen Global Media and Nielsen Global Connect will have added flexibility and will strengthen their path forward toward the new phase of growth, productivity and industry leadership. As we work on the separation, we've been developing fit for purpose capital structure targets for both companies. The Board believes that now is the right time to adjust the dividend in order to strengthen the two prospective balance sheets ahead of the separation and provide flexibility to invest for growth.","With the strategic review now concluded, I will return to my role as Chairman of the Board. As you know, I had taken on the role of Executive Chairman in July 2018 to oversee the strategic review and the CEO search, both of which are now completed.","To close, I also want to thank Nielsen's leadership team and every associate around the world for their dedication and the remarkable ability to deliver during this process. Dave will now review the separation considerations. ","David Anderson","Good morning, thanks Jim. Let's turn to Slide #7. So a couple of headlines here relative to the separation process. First of all, we expect this transaction to be tax-free to Nielsen and its shareholders for U.S. Federal Income Tax purposes and it will also meet UK legal requirements. The stock distribution ratio will be determined at a later date. Now we expect to complete the transaction within 9 to 12 months, work is well underway and we're going to be transparent as possible through this process. And during this time we will focus on positioning each business to be successful as separate companies while also working to minimize the distraction for our clients and also the Nielsen Associates.","Key next steps to completion include developing standalone financial statements for each business, separating the businesses from a legal and operational standpoint and then of course the capital structure and governance considerations. We've also looked at the historical commercial relationships that exist between both businesses. We believe we can continue those through arm's-length agreements. We believe we have the resources necessary to complete this separation successfully and stand up each company from a position of strength.","Closing conditions will include among others, favorable rulings and legal opinions on tax matters, the effectiveness of the registration statement for the shares of the new company that will be distributed to Nielsen's shareholders, and final approval by the Board of Directors and Nielsen's shareholders. And as Jim mentioned, the Board has decided to change our capital allocation policy which will enable Nielsen to strengthen its balance sheet and invest in growth. So we have adjusted our quarterly dividend to $0.06 per share effective this December. This is also a key component of achieving the desired leverage ratios for each business at the time of the spin.","Now over time, we see different target leverage ratios for each business with a median term leverage goal of roughly 3 to 3.5 for Media and approximately 2 to 2.5 for Connect. Again, those are our best views at this time. We expect to refine those in more detail as we go through the separation process. And while there are going to be some one-time costs to effect the full separation and spin, we expect the ongoing incremental standalone and public company costs to be manageable.","And with that, let me turn the call back to David.","David Kenny","Thank you. So I've been at Nielsen's for 11 months and I wanted to share some views on what I've learned in Media and what we've accomplished and where we are going. I'd say in Media trusted data has always been and remains critical. The changing dynamics including growing complexity, mistrust, data leakage, fraud, et cetera, are creating an even greater need for trusted data and Nielsen is foundational therefore to bring trust to the Media markets. One Media truth is absolutely critical to creating a fair playing field in Media and only Nielsen can provide that [indiscernible] quality.","We've made significant progress in our digital transformation over the past several years, now we need to invest further and go faster. Clients want one measurement definition across digital and TV. They want our data to feed into planning systems that can help allocate their medial spend and they are looking to understand the ROI in that spend with outcome metrics. We've accomplished a lot towards that goal in 2019.","We've met our expectations every quarter this year. We've aligned our technology and operations to drive end-to-end accountability that we're organized for speed and scale. We have detailed product roadmaps and a plan for true consistent digital and TV measurement. We are also investing in our addressable TV platform which is important to the industry long term and we've identified the opportunity for international expansion and how to go after it.","Nielsen has an essential role in the Medial ecosystem. The actions we've taken in 2019 strengthen our position. We have demonstrated our ability to respond to change along with the market which includes the tremendous progress we've made towards being the digital currency.","As the market evolves, clients are looking for pervasive digital measurement that\u2019s aligns with linear reliable planning and optimization tools that are easy to use. That's what we're building and we're investing to move with greater velocity. That investment is in three strategic pillars. First, Nielsen measured the total audience.","Consumers have more viewing and listening options and Media in order to have more ways to monetize their assets than ever before. We're focused on the one thing that is constant, the audiences. We are pushing forward with our digital initiatives such as true cross media products brining to the industry a single comprehensive audience measure that supports multiple business models for monetization.","Our product roadmaps are focused on delivering pervasive and consistent digital measurements providing clients with greater transparency around monetization, while helping Nielsen continue to drive the industry's currency. We are leveraging our investments in great [indiscernible] and so into the Media to bring the same level of transparency and scalability to addressable television, the target ads on a segmented basis.","Second, we're investing to predict and measure outcomes. Our audience data and artificial intelligence tools are [indiscernible] planning across platforms providing transparency into our cross Media plan. We're integrating those outcomes based solutions enabling clients to make performance based decisions in a large-scale way. Our dual focus on audiences and outcomes will enable the market to transact more efficiently. Advertisers will have greater transparency about what is working, agencies can build more effective plans, and publishers can better demonstrate the value of their inventory.","And third, we are expanding our global presence in both existing and new markets. Digital is a big part of the global opportunity, but I will include TV and audio as well. We are unifying our go-to-market strategy and product offerings across our international markets. These roadmaps support the future of Media ensuring our ongoing relevance and central importance as one media truth globally.","We have a clear roadmap in place to deliver this growth and value. 2019 has been about starting to build a new foundation. We understand the clients are facing big shifts in their businesses in the move to direct-to-consumer models and addressable. I gave two examples. And Nielsen is investing where the market is headed. This creates new opportunities for faster growth over time and highlights the importance of these investments to drive one media truth across all monetization models. We expect these investments to deliver mid single digit revenue growth over the next several years as Nielsen becomes the true cost platform currency and drive faster growth in analytics.","So sum up on Media, there has never been a more important time for one media truth. Clients are looking to transact in new and different ways and we are enabling them to do this with trust which drives value for our clients and also for our shareholders.","Now let me turn to Nielsen Global Connect and that's a very exciting business. Connect is the only truly global player in a growing market with a 9-decade history serving the FMCG and retailer ecosystems. Evolving market dynamics are creating even more opportunities. We are the sole measurement provider in the majority of our emerging markets where we also benefit from macros trends. FMCG and retail clients are seeking more data driven solutions to help them compete and Nielsen has the actionable data and decision making tools to help them in a innovate and grow.","Our ability to do so increases as we further deploy the Nielsen Connect platform which is the only truly open cloud native measurement and analytics platform and this enabled clients to work with one data shoe set across their entire global organizations. The Nielsen Connect platform has opened us up to work with strategic partners across the landscape. This open platform is a key competitive differentiator.","Nielsen uniquely has data partnerships with leading retailers across brick-and-mortar and e-commerce and the Nielsen Connect platform allows us to work with more than 65 data and analytics companies in our Connect partner network. We have strong technology partners that support and provide a solid foundation for Nielsen Connects backend. All of these partnerships allow us to build, deploy and scale innovative solutions, with the velocity required to stay ahead of our client need in an open and interoperable ecosystem.","What's next for Nielsen Connect? We have four strategic pillars we're investing against. First, focusing on a broad and accelerating deployment of the Nielsen Connect platform. This includes recent launches at UNFI, the premier food wholesaler in North America and Coca-Cola. These and other clients view our data and cloud based technology as important levers that benefit their businesses. This is an important driver of renewal discussions and client wins.","For example, we recently renewed with P&G in the United States as well as a global partnership with General Mills. Second, we're broadening our coverage and granularity to measure the total consumer. This includes the fast-growing emerging markets and includes e-commerce, specialty channels such as Pets. Extending our omnichannel coverage is a key priority. Third, Nielsen is strengthening and expanding our retail partnerships.","Our retail collaboration programs enable efficiency for manufacturers and growth for retailers as well as interest in a broad range of our capabilities. Retailers are increasingly looking for real-time analytics in areas like pricing, promotions, and personalization analytics. The Connect platform enables us to deliver scale, all lean on analytics which address their needs. And finally, the transformation of our Connect business has a big operational cost reduction opportunity as we drive automation and close down legacy systems.","To sum up on Connect, we have a strong foundation, unique global reach and scale. We have initiatives in place to improve our performance and achieve greater potential for shareholders and clients.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave for the financial discussion.","David Anderson","So what I'd like to do is, take you through a summary financial view of each of the businesses before going into greater detail on the third quarter performance and our updated 2019 outlook. So, turning to Slide #18 let's start with Media. On the left side of the page is just a snapshot of our 2018 Medial financial profile and our 2019 forecast. The 2018 numbers are consistent with our current reporting. They don\u2019t include any other costs of operating some standalone business. The Media has of course delivered low single digit organic growth over the last several years and it has continued its strong profit generation.","On the right side I've shown medium term targets for the business at a summary level. Through 2023 as a result of investments we're making and the key initiatives that David referenced we expect mid single digit organic compound average growth rate. This would result in a growth profile that is in line with the Media market and the Information Services peers. We're investing in product roadmaps that align where the market is headed.","Our growth investments will build over time or anticipating low single-digit revenue growth through 2021 with revenue ramping to mid single-digit growth in 2022 and beyond as the investments in digital enhancing TV measurement addressable predicting measuring outcomes and driving international growth faster. The Media business has attractive margins. We're going to invest to drive accelerated growth over time as well as continue to drive productivity.","Now over the last several years, turning now to Slide 19, the Connect business has been challenged largely in the U.S. which is roughly a quarter of the total global Connect revenues. We're intensely focused on improving the trajectory of the U.S. business and driving improved operational performance across the business globally. We've begun to make progress. It is showing up in our results. Organic revenue growth excluding one timers was negative in 2017 and 2018, that has turned around. We expect comparable revenue to grow with margin expansion in 2019.","On the right side of the page regarding medium-term targets, we expect Connect revenue growth to improve as the U.S. turns around. We also expect steady trends in other developed markets and accelerating growth in emerging markets helped by an improvement in China. This should yield a low single-digit organic CAGR through 2023. And improving topline along with productivity and operational efficiency initiatives should drive significant margin expansion.","Importantly, we are on course with a number of key initiatives including throughput at our super hubs, automating field operations and delivering scale product offerings via the Nielsen Connect platform. We're targeting adjusted EBITDA margins in the high teens over the next several years excluding any standalone cost following the separation.","So with that summary perspective, let's now go to Slide 21, talk about the third quarter and the rest of 2019. First, we're obviously pleased with results for the third quarter, which were ahead of our expectations. Total company revenue which you can see increased 2.4% on a constant currency basis, which compares to our expectation of being up slightly. We saw solid trends in Media and Connect in the third quarter with Media growing, and Connect flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Revenue increased 1.9% on an organic constant currency basis and if we exclude the carryover effect of some one-time items in prior periods, organic revenue grew 2.4%.","For the third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $476 million up 1.7% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.5% up two basis points reported down 20 basis points on a constant currency basis. This is slightly better than our expectation of margins in the third quarter. Now these margins benefited from positive performance and productivity, partially offset by investments in new products and technology, as well as investments in our people.","The GAAP third quarter tax rate was well below our prior forecasts. Last quarter, you may recall that I mentioned we're anticipating the conclusion of several tax audits in the second half. In the third quarter we resolved a number of these audits resulting in the closure of various statutes of limitation. Consequently, we released approximately $409 million of tax contingencies and after you adjust for this our 18.6% book tax rate in the third quarter includes other discrete tax items.","Adjusted EPS was $0.51 compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of 2018 reflecting a higher EBITDA and also the tax favorability I mentioned, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization year-over-year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $301 million, compared to $266 million in 2018 reflecting strong collections in the quarter and I have to \u2013hats off really to the team who put a lot of focus on this in the quarter, they did a terrific job. Year-over-year we also had lower restructuring, higher taxes due to one-time payments, but also lower CapEx. So overall, the third quarter results reflect continued solid execution and tremendous work across both Media and Connect.","Now let's just go through the highlights of each segment starting with Media on Slide 22. Revenue for the third quarter for Media was $870 million up 4.6% on a constant currency basis. Media outperformed our expectations, partly driven by higher than expected growth in digital and lower than expected declines in local. Audience measurement was up 4.7% constant currency, Plan\/Optimize was up 4.2% constant currency.","Media's adjusted EBITDA was $381 million, up 1.6% constant currency and the margins for the business for 43.8% down 128 basis points in constant currency and again in line with our internal expectations. We're investing in Media's core franchise and growth drivers, but also getting the benefit of productivity.","Let's go to Slide 23 with Connect, third quarter Connect revenue $746 million flat with last year on a constant currency basis. Measure was down 0.4% constant currency, Predict\/Activate was up 0.9%. I'd note that the third quarter Measure revenue was impacted by timing and some revenue expected in the third quarter shifted into the fourth quarter.","Developed markets for Connect were up 3% constant currency, emerging markets revenue was up 5% in the third quarter. Connect adjusted EBITDA was $109 million up 1.9% year-over-year constant currency. And EBITDA margins were 14.6% up 27 basis points constant currency driven by productivity initiatives.","Next, let me touch on the noncash impairment charge we took in the third quarter related to Connect. As part of the strategic review during the quarter, we performed an updated assessment of Connect recording unit, which led to a noncash goodwill impairment of $1 billion in the third quarter or $2.82 a share. This has resulted in an updated carrying value for the business of $2.6 billion approximately, including cash.","Let's now turn to our outlook for 2019. On Slide 24, we're maintaining our 2019 guidance for revenue adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and we're increasing our adjusted EPS. Our guidance includes total company constant currency revenue of approximately flat to up 1.5%. We continue to expect to be at or above the midpoint of the 28% to 29% adjusted EBITDA and margin range for the full year.","The margin is going to be driven by significant productivity, again partially offset by reinvestment in the businesses. We\u2019re increasing our adjusted EPS guide for the year from $1.70, $1.80 range previously to $1.77 to $1.83. This includes the 4Q tax rate assumption of roughly 40% before discrete items as we expect some discrete items in the quarter. We've lowered our restructuring guidance from previously $145 million to $155 million for the year to now $80 million to $100 million.","We've achieved our productivity targets on lower restructuring this year, and we expect restructuring spend to ramp, although we expect some restructuring to ramp somewhat in the fourth quarter, the full year should be below our previous expectations. And lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. As we discussed, key drivers compared to 2018 include lower incentive compensation payouts and also lower retail payment -- retailer payments, offset in part by higher net cash interest and cash taxes.","So before going into more detail in the segment outlook, let me just make a few summary points about our fourth quarter expectations. We expect the fourth quarter constant currency year-over-year revenue growth to be lower than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect margins to be flat to up slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see the benefit of productivity which provides support for investment in growth initiatives.","We expect fourth quarter cash flow to be down year-over-year against a particularly tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2018. EBITDA the cash conversion remains a focus, and obviously a significant opportunity for the company. We're going to continue to focus on improving contractual terms, collection practices as we go forward.","And then finally, let's turn to Slide 25. The segment outlook first Media, we continue to expect Audience Measurement to be at the high end of the 2% to 3% range -- growth range and Plan\/Optimize to be at the low end of the 1% to 2% range. I'd note that the Telecom business that surprises to the downside this year, there could put incremental pressure on Plan\/Optimize.","In Audience Measurement, our full year guide suggests slower growth in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, due in part to greater pressure in local in audio that helped third quarter, but doesn't repeat in the fourth quarter and the anticipated slower growth in national.","In Connect, we continue to expect Measure to be at the high end of the minus 1%, to plus 1% range for the year and Predict\/Activate to be in the previously provided minus 4% to minus 2% range for the year. And I mentioned some timing shifts, I mentioned that earlier from 3Q to 4Q, which will help the growth rate in Measurement in the fourth quarter.","So in summary, we're confident in our plan. We have a strong commitment to deliver on all fronts. We're obviously seeing tremendous commitment and execution by our management team and associates globally. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress as we go forward.","And with that, let me turn it back over to David.","David Kenny","Thank you, I know there are thousands of my Nielsen colleagues with me, this around the world and we really want to thank each and every one of them. The fact that the company rallied, got operating discipline, delivered its numbers, delivered clean quarters, gave us all a lot more confidence in looking at our options. And I think the Board really appreciated that because while we looked at a number of options, the Board concluded unanimously that separating Nielsen Global Media and Nielsen Global Connect into two independent, strong, publicly traded companies is the best path to enhance strategic and financial success to drive long-term value.","This separation is going to unlock value of two strong global franchises. Nielsen Connect and Nielsen Media each have a clear plan and key initiatives in place to improve revenue, profits and free cash flow, as independent companies over time. This separation is going to allow focused and faster decision making, which allows us to accelerate our transformations. We are targeting completion of the separation within nine to 12 months.","And with that I'll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Gubins","Thank you, David. Denise, we're now ready to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Good morning. I wanted to first thank you for sharing all of your plans and insights on the two businesses, really great to hear your views. I wanted to get a little sense on the margin outlook from each of the Media and Connect business. Do you feel like the level of reinvestment ahead a really will need to gross margins to go lower before heading towards the longer-term margin targets that you laid out on slide 18 and 19?","David Anderson","Andrew, this is a really - this is Dave. This is a really good question. Obviously, we're working real time through all of that. We're very focused - we've been very focused obviously on the culmination, the completion of the strategic review and really setting the stage as David said for two businesses to be very successful. We are now working through our 2020 and 2021 numbers, it's very much a work in process. So we will be back to you in terms of providing more insights in terms of that question.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo, your line is open.","William Warmington","Good morning everyone. So a question for you on the Connect side. There back at the last Investor Day, there were a lot of some pretty significant cost saving opportunities that had been laid out at that point. And I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about where do you think those cost saving opportunities is still there, and how they fit into your comments about seeing potential for organic growth and margin expansion in Connect next year?","David Kenny","Yes, Dave do you want me to, you want me maybe just to start that and you can add. I think, first of all our focus you'll recall, we did a refresh as we prepared the 2019 plan very, very much focused on both, labor and non-labor productivity.","We're absolutely on track with those numbers. We've created significant process discipline in the organization. We've really benefited from that. Again it's - you'll recall the 370 basis points of gross productivity that we've targeted. So we're executing against that. We put in place activities, disciplines, tracking within the organization that really gives us confidence.","We again will update as we do the 2020 outlook in more detail at the beginning of the year. We will give you updates in terms of how that looks then on a go forward basis as well as a longer term perspective on that. But right now, the thing I would say it's just really encouraging, is the fact that we've got so much that's in flight, and is showing up in terms of our performance. David, anything you'd want to add?","David Anderson","Yes, I wasn't here for the Investor Day that you're talking about. We need a new one next year on this business. I think it's - but what I would say is impressive about Connect is that we're focused on what I would call it sustainable productivity. I think there were some blanket cost reduction actions. But what we're doing now and I've seen is when we roll out new technology, when we combine things into super hubs, when we automate the way we collect data, we're actually able to use technology to have productivity that is sustainable, as opposed to just reducing headcount and asking people to work harder. So I feel like we've got a real sustainable, renewable, subscription based approach to productivity now, more like an information services business should be, so it's much more sustainable.","William Warmington","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. As Connect spins off, could you talk about how we should think about this synergy, so in addition to extra public company costs, I'm sure there's going to be some, I guess, shared real estate or overhead and you may not want to give a number, but could you just help us think about what the pieces of the synergies will be? Thank you.","David Anderson","Sure. Yes as I mentioned, Toni, there's going to be obviously some onetime costs. It's true we provided a specific number on that. But regarding a question on the synergies and the standalone, we worked earlier this year significantly under David's leadership and direction to align the businesses end-to-end. So the separation work now is going to be really largely focused on back office, the tech platforms and also real estate.","In addition, there'll be some incremental costs, which will include some public company costs and IT, et cetera. But we anticipate these are going to be relatively small on an ongoing basis? So I think that's part of it, it's a good question, and it's part of the math in terms of looking at this strategy, and it's supported this strategy that we think those are quite manageable on a go forward basis.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Todd Juenger","Hi. Good morning, I thought one thing that stood out to me and I'd love to hear more about is, you cited several times an opportunity on the Media side, international, in terms of the growth opportunity, and I guess somewhat surprised to hear that for a couple reasons. First, I don't think you have a lot of the assets internationally, especially the panels that give you the position that you have in the states. And so I wonder if you believe you can provide a solution without those assets, or do we need to build those things?","And then secondly, as you know, the way the market works in a lot of countries is very different with these joint industry commissions and stuff. And so it's a tougher market, it seems and a lot of ways. So I'd love to hear why, if you could share a little more about how maybe specifically you see some of that opportunity and what the investment requirement is given some of the factors that I put out there, or maybe I need to be educated on the markets. Maybe they're different than what I think, thanks.","David Kenny","Yes, so it's a good question, Todd, here's what I think is happening. Total Audience is a combination of linear and digital as you know. The digital platform and we partner within digital partners our platforms are more global businesses. And that digital platform including the panel components of digital ad rating, can go first. So I think it doesn't always have to go linear digital and then total it can actually go digital partner with linear and then get to tell us so there's a different route to go on the Measurement side.","And I would say we're increasing finding ways to partner including with [indiscernible] and as you mentioned in some of the markets in order to cover that. We are the digital currency today in 39 markets that folks like YouTube use us in those markets. So we're establishing the currency digital first. I would also say if you look at the trend, digital is becoming the leading way that content is distributed. So as we bring in, I think, really superior technology on independent digital measurement, we bring in superior technology, streaming measurement, this is going to be important on a global basis.","Then the second layer I talked about was how we get to outcomes. I think having the metadata platform of [indiscernible], which is a global business, having much of our analytics business work globally, is also helping us. So we've got a good chunk of the business working globally today, we can double down it. And I would say, as we've looked at each market, we've built a path to get to that total audience vision. It's not exactly the same path we followed in the U.S. or [indiscernible] couple of markets where we've gone the sort of linear outlook, but we're getting to the same endpoint and getting that over the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen","Oh, hi, thanks. And I'll echo the thanks on the thorough and concise presentation. The question I have is also on the synergies, but it's not so much about real estate costs or whatever. Nielsen and what used to be AC Nielsen have been together and apart and together and now apart again, at least a couple of times over the last couple decades or whatever.","My question is, in terms of the operations, I mean, it seemed when the two companies recombined many years ago, there was an argument that they belong together because there were lots of things they could work together on and comparing media and exposure with product purchase decisions, et cetera, develop this marketing effectiveness tool, which was very successful for some time. So my question is, in terms of operations, what would the dis-synergies now be separating? I clearly think it's probably not such a bad thing, but I just wondered if you can give us a bit more color on what you could still do together even as separate companies or what you might lose being separated? Thanks.","David Kenny","Yes so thanks, Tim and yeah certainly I've watched outside the company, having worked with both sides of it, exactly you're describing. Let me just be direct on that. Starting with client value, and you mentioned marketing effectiveness. There was a great thesis that if you measured years ago, you measure what people watch and you measure what people buy, you could correlate them and donate [ph] a better model.","So that would work if we measured everything people buy, but the connectedness measured CPG. You know maybe decades ago that was the majority of advertising today the CPG industry is 9% of the ad revenue in Media. So it is equally important that we provide marketing effectiveness in the auto industry, in the pharmaceutical industry, in the insurance industry, in the credit card industry, everybody who is advertising needs to actually build out those correlations.","And so, by separating the two it allows the Media business to focus on all industries and not over index on CPG, number one. I think secondly, as we focused on a number of those other industries we're beginning to build good data partnerships with other information service firms, to make things connect in order to be able to provide those outcome measures. We will continue to have a preferred relationship between Nielsen Connect and Nielsen Media to serve those FMCG companies and we've sorted that out so that those clients who use both for this will get that.","So I would say that the product is going to continue to work fine for CPG. But more importantly, the media business is going to focus I think, much more aggressively on serving all industries, which gives it a real growth opportunity, on the outcome side of media business, so that's one. And then I think, secondly, if you talk about cost synergies and operations, I actually think there was just economies of scale when I arrived when we tried to do too much at the common back, end.","Part of what we learned in the strategic review, it's very different to run an operation that support the rating service than the operation that supports FMCG by separating the two operations, which I did when I first got here, part of the reason we've enjoyed solid performance, part of the reason we're hitting our numbers, part of the reason that we're able to raise our guidance, again this quarter is because we actually broke them apart. Having clear line of sight between the front end and product and the back end operations is more important than putting them together.","So I actually think sometimes when you combine things, you make them work, and I think that was the case here, separate operations is working much better.","Tim Nollen","Great, thanks that's right.","David Anderson","If I would just add to that \u2013 I\u2019ll just add to that quickly just also the benefit just to reinforce what we showed earlier. And what we've discussed is, you can see it showing up in the numbers. You can see it in the results, and you can see it in terms of the ownership of the P&L by the business leaders, and increasingly, also the balance sheet and cash flow. So all of that I think is working together.","A - David Kenny","Tim Nollen","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning. So, broadly the plan that you've laid out to both Media and Connect sounds very familiar to what we've heard over the past year and even under prior management. So, I guess, I'm just curious, what is it about the spin that makes it more executable because it just feels like you're adding an extra layer of noise and work that probably makes this even harder. So I was just curious for your thoughts there?","David Kenny","Yes, thank you, Manav and listen \u2013 I do think this is largely about execution versus sort of great new strategies. Here is what I think is different, having the Connect business stand on its own, owning its entire P&L end-to-end, helps make better decisions. I think the trade-offs between what things we automate and what things we do with humans is important. I think the way we work, super hubs is right, the way we rollout technology is right. So having that all end-to-end, it got much faster iteration to move to that endpoint.","I think secondly, there is a big difference in actually having launched the connected system having an open platform that is truly differentiated. Clients who've done head to head comparisons with alternatives are 100% using the Connect system, because for many reasons, the part of it is because it's open and they can connect with their other tools. So I think there is real product differentiation that helps us as well.","So I think that Connect business is actually just going to fly at a much higher velocity of standing alone. Similarly, I think on the media business, having the ability to really focus on the investments to stay relevant is key. The changes in the dividend, the changes in our capital allocation, the willingness to invest in our future I think is a really important decision we've made with our Board. There are a few investments that are necessary to pull this off. We're going at those very deliberately, very, very disciplined way.","I think we're not throwing caution to the wind, but I think actually making sure we deliver the technology, the operational process, the end-to-end accountability, and the right talent is different. So I would say, I'm not arguing a different strategy. I'm arguing far better, far clear execution, and that will only be enhanced by being two companies.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Muller with Baird. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, Tim Pollock on for Jeff, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the theory you gave around the leverage levels for media and connect the standalone businesses. But I'm wondering if you can provide some clarity on some of the cash flow profile of each and then kind of what you expect to catch those leverage targets?","David Anderson","Sure again, what we said those were medium term numbers, it kind of a rough kind of I think in terms of the cash flow profile. As we publish a report EBITDA for both and we also in our filings have CapEx for both businesses. So it's sort of simple math, but that's a way to look at it in terms of their respective cash characteristics. That said, as you've seen, we continue to get better just in executing, operationally and it's particularly evident on the Connect side of the business with the global nature of that business.","It really lends itself to focus and discipline in terms of particularly cash collections. We saw the improvement again in the quarter in terms of DSL improvement. We've seen that aggressively better over the course of the year. And so, we're going to continue to look at opportunities to just improve the cash generation for each, but particularly the upside exists on a relative basis. The upside exists on the Connect side with margin expansion over time that I referenced, and also some of the working capital improvements that we're on track to deliver and we\u2019ll continue to deliver.","And then also a lower profile in terms of CapEx over time for the Connect business. So all of those are order well for getting to those leverage targets that I talked about in terms of midterm medium term targets.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks good morning, you laid out up medium term targets for media to grow at a mid single-digit CAGR through 2023. And you had said that the path won't necessarily be linear. Can you help flush that out specifically, how do you plan to layer in your growth initiatives. And what external factors could perhaps prevent you from reaching growth that's in line with the broader media markets?","David Kenny","Yes, as think the way we're pacing it is \u2013 to make sure we have adequate strategy in the categories I talked about. So in certain investments to make sure we deliver media measurement across in OMNI channel plan and we're, we do that pretty well today. There are some places we might have some gap. I\u2019d say on the outcome side we've got a number of pieces things we've acquired over time that will be going to invest to integrate this in your common platform.","And as I discussed earlier, those investments to make sure we're actually putting down bigger markers more aggressively on international markets. So in some cases, some of the investments a little ahead of the revenue, we're certainly making sure we've lined up the market before we do that. So it's not a huge investment waiting for them to come. But we're, pacing through that ambition. In terms of external factors and we always have the economy, which affects meeting everything.","But I think, part of what we're doing here with delevering is to make sure that we can withstand anything that goes on with the economy. I would say, on the on the client demand side, our client needs are changing. I spent a lot of time with our clients in media, but I would say our clients are leaning into us right now, because of this strategy and their belief that we're going to be really important for all the ways they make money in the future and not be completely, focused on linear.","So I would say, certainly our client business models are going to change and we're going to change with them.","George Tong","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Salmon","Hey, good morning, everyone. I apologize. I've been back and forth between a couple calls, but I just want to follow up the dividend, I believe would stay with Nielsen Media and that Nielsen Connect, I think would spin off without an established dividend policy. If I could just clarify that first. And then maybe the bigger picture one for David Kenny. As you look at Nielsen Media, where do you think your priorities are for your free cash flow and in particular, your appetite for M&A? No doubt, there's a lot of internal investment and development you want to do. But how much do you think the M&A market could potentially help? Thanks.","David Kenny","So Dan, I'll take that first part, this is Dave. You're correct. I mean, given the cash flow profile Connect, it's unlikely that we would pay it a dividend. So really should think in practical terms about that as being part of media going forward. And David, do you want to take that second one?","David Anderson","Yes. So listen, and the free cash flow. Certainly, I want to pay down debt. So I think deleveraging going to be important to be able to do more things, as you said, and I think we have a very clear path of what we're building organically. We will always look at alternatives. If there's something that has been built by another company, we can acquire it and it could speed things up to achieve our roadmap will certainly do that. I do think we're more deliberate than we might have been in the past to make sure anything we acquired integrates to a platform, and some of what I'm I think, 16 hours and prior smart acquisitions that weren't as integrated as they need to be.","So certainly, we have a very clear plan around being one media truth both for audience measurement and for outcome on a global basis, and we'll be acquiring everywhere to make M&A move. They will be the feeling things we were going to build, because we could do it faster. That also say, a related question is, I believe that we're increasingly easier to work with as a partner.","There are other solutions for clients that we may not need to own with a Nielsen, but we need to work more interoperably with. So that would help. That's the Media question. You didn't ask on Connect, but I would just add that, on the Connect side, there's also a very clear roadmap, and there are opportunities for them to accelerate their progress as well to selected tuck in acquisition. So both companies I think have very clear direction now. And we'll look at tuck-in acquisitions when they accelerate their roadmap.","Dan Salmon","Okay great, thank you both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for David and one for Dave. David, can you give us maybe the latest lay of the land on cross platform, you know when you're talking to buyers, sellers including the big digital first players, what's the feedback like right now that the buy in right now and what's the timeline to getting the right kind of approved to kind of product in market?","I'd love to hear just maybe your latest thinking there and [indiscernible] just the data sets are there any other data sets you feel like you need to acquire build to include in that measurement, obviously, you have some census level data set-top box data that hasn't been, as far as I know, integrated yet into this integrated product. But again, we just love kind of both the latest thoughts there. And then just one real quick one for Dave, Dave just curious if you'd update us on your plans, post the spin? Great, thanks.","David Kenny","Okay, so, first of all, I think the demand from cross platform is very strong on the demand or advertiser side first, so I would say the agencies and the advertisers all wanting a simpler way to buy Media and to have apples-to-apples comparisons. And they're all really wanting more than ever right now, independent verified third party data. They want to know that their people not lost and want to make sure that they're measuring things rigorously. They rely on Nielsen. And so I'd say the demand side from advertisers agencies in the association represent them have been very deep with us [indiscernible] we are certainly working with it to get things adopted as a currency.","Now, I mean, we're beginning that process now in a number of markets around the world. Because of that, and because things are expanding, I would say, on the south side, our publisher clients, the digital guys certainly believe in digital ad ratings. I think we've seen continued adoption and endorsement of what we're building. But the more that can actually be consistent with other media particularly linear media is helping so they're pushing. I think, as there's been the launch of more direct consumer businesses as there's been I think, sort of an explosion of connected TVs out there are even our historic linear customers are now believing their growth is also there.","So they're pushing for the same thing. And it's a big part of the renewal discussions we've had this year, as folks are signing on to Nielsen. So I would say it's very much in motion, I think the market would like us to move as fast as possible. This simplification of the organization will help with that. I think some of the capital allocation decisions we've made will help with that. So we're going to run hard at that. And it's, it's, I think, happening real time in a big way. And here's the data set.","I would say as I said before, on the outcome side, part of the advantage of actually being two companies that we used to use, and we still will use a lot the Nielsen Connect data set for the CPG advertiser, but in all the other categories. The work we do at JD Power around, auto, some of the work again with some of the other financial services providers around financial service advertising is getting to add more and more categories is key. I do not think we need to acquire those data sets. I think we can do that through partnership.","Lastly, I think all of this is becoming more digital needs a true set on the content itself. Great, now it was a brilliant acquisition, that core metadata is highly differentiated for the way we're measuring in the future and getting that more integrated is going to help. There is nothing else like that, great stuff, but I want to see great stuff continue to expand globally, and continue to be one metadata truth underneath all of this.","I'll let Dave talk about his plans.","David Anderson","Thank you. So you know, obviously, we're very, very focused, you could say, maybe preoccupied with ensuring the successful separation and then you know, ultimately, spin up the Connect business. And there's so many dimensions of that, that both focus on the Connect business as well as support for the media business and really standing up successfully both of those businesses as public independent entities.","So there's a tremendous amount of work that's going to be required to do that we're going to be able to leverage. I've been with the company now for about 14 months. And we're going to be able to leverage all of that learning and apply that to that successful outcome. And then, as we've said, we'll come back with more on leadership plants for the organization as a whole over time. So that will include my role in the organization as well. Right now there's a there's just a tremendous amount to be done with the job at hand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks for taking the question. So there are several high profile [indiscernible] shortly. Can you just comment on your conversations with the Media company and expanding - about expanding your offering? Thanks.","David Kenny","You broke up a little bit with extending the offerings to streaming and DTC [ph].","Ashish Sabadra","Yes, I know I was just - my question was there a lot of high profile streaming services which are launching shortly? And so how your conversations with media companies are evolving off those launches?","David Anderson","Yes, listen, [Indiscernible] high profile streaming services companies have also been mentioned Nielsen lately and talking to me, I think as the DTC market become, it has more offers, they are all looking at . market share. And I think the market share is not subscriber counter market share the actual usage in viewing as we've always been in television, so, our investment in streaming meters, our ability to measure accurately how much time people are spending on these DTH services and what they're watching is really helpful.","And that becomes the basis of trading not just for advertising, which only applies to the [indiscernible] part of that, but also for the way the content makers work with companies and the way that companies measure their market share in their consumer marketing. So I think the value of one media truth is even more important in those DTC businesses. And we're certainly seeing all of them, want to use Nielsen to better understand, what consumers are preferring and how they can better serve their consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks. Hey, with the shift in the dividend, which frees up a lot of cash, just any thoughts on that incremental if we ever feels like it's about $400 million. Does that initially go towards restructuring or how should we think about the use of that cash going forward?","David Anderson","Well, I think it\u2019s - I really take the priority as David mentioned, it's really deleveraging is really get paid down. I mean what we're really all about here as we've said is to create the best possible conditions for each business. And this is a key part of that it really helps - will help us facilitate setting the stage for the launch of both as independent public companies. So that's really at the end of the day, that's where the focus is, that's what the priority was.","Operator","Your last question comes from Aaron White\u2019s with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi everyone, thanks for fitting me in here at the end. Maybe just as an add-on to the last question, but you did indicate that the main driver of reducing the dividend was due to a desire to set up the balance sheet ahead of the separation. Are you able to give us any sense for where you see leverage or you'd like leverage to be 9 to 12 months from now relative the kind of 4.4 times currently? And I guess on a related note to that you spoke to the medium term leverage targets for each of the businesses, would you be able to give us a sense of what leverage you envision for the media and connect businesses out of the gates as they kind of start the march towards those targets? Thank you very much.","David Anderson","Yes, we would anticipate that for Connect. We would be in that, let's call it 2.5 times range at start. Connect will be taking a less than pro rata portion of the existing deck. So obviously, video is going to be a little higher than what the current assuming that outcome for Connect, video would be a little higher than in the current level ratio. But it's going to take a few years, and we're going to get to the target range. It's obviously going to be also dependent on as David pointed out other investment opportunities. It is obviously a very attractive business with very, very attractive cash profile. So we've got things that we can do. But I think that gives you a pretty good indication of where we start more.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","David Kenny","Well, thanks for the question. Go ahead.","Operator","Sorry, I would now like to turn the call back over to David Kenny for closing remarks.","David Kenny","So everything's getting preemptive. Got a big day ahead, listen. Thank you for joining the call. I appreciate the questions. And I'm actually excited about this new day for Nielsen when we're going to focus entirely on building the value and the strategic review will now be closed. This is a great day for all of us, and I am so excited about our future.","We will work hard to complete this separation in the 9 to 12 month timeframe. At the same time we're going to continue to drive operational excellence and product excellence in each of our two businesses. And we're going to be as transparent as possible through this process and update you as we can. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] And today's call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to the host, Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Zale, please proceed.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's second quarter financial performance. Joining me on the call today from Nielsen is David Calhoun, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations and prospects. These and other statements that relate to future financial results and events are based on Nielsen\u2019s view as of today, July 25, 2012.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that we believe to be material are outlined in Nielsen\u2019s 2011 Form 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find on ir.nielsen.com. We encourage you to consult these documents for a more complete understanding of these risks and uncertainties. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by securities laws.","A slide presentation that we\u2019ll use on this call is available under the events section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nielsen.com.","We use certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the results of our operations. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results of operations. Further definition and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our results under GAAP is available at the end of our press release. It is also in the Appendix of the webcast slide presentation we're using on today's call and on our IR website.","Our agenda for today's call will start with Dave with a brief summary of our results for the quarter and the business update. Then, Brian will discuss financials for the quarter and will take us through full year guidance, and then we'll take time to address your questions.","And now to start the call, I'd like to introduce our CEO, David Calhoun.","David L. Calhoun","Hi. Good morning, everyone. First slide. Absent currency translation, we had a very solid operating quarter. Revenue on a reported basis declined 1%; on a constant-currency basis, grew 4%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 1% on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant-currency basis. Margin expansion met expectations in every way and net debt leverage of 4x as we finished the quarter.","Growth and resilience were sort of apparent in what is clearly a more difficult macro environment. And for us, you see those implications in the developing markets, as well as the developed markets. Tangible progress in all our growth investments. High confidence. We'll talk about a few of those here in the upfront comments, and then we'll get more to it in Q&A I'm sure. And we are reaffirming our 2012 guidance.","With respect to the operating environment, strong growth in North America. For us, it has been robust, 7% on the buy side, which is, of course, sort of the bigger piece of the puzzle. And the Wal-Mart implementation went beautifully with very, very little lift in 2Q with respect to revenue in buy. So those are -- those days are ahead of us.","Difficult operating climate in western Europe, not news to anybody. Just to frame it, that is a little less than 15% of our overall revenue. Despite that tough environment, the resilience of our information business is always as apparent, and it continues to grow. Insights has been -- has declined quite a bit, over 20%.","Solid growth in the developing markets, but not as robust as I would like. As you all know, we have a target of double digit. In the quarter, it grew 7%. Global multinationals are clearly being more selective. Believe it or not, I believe most of that is a reaction to difficulties in developed markets and just more selective resource calls.","Local clients continue to accelerate. Our first-time client count continues to go up. And the growth in our priority markets, or what I'll call our investment markets: China, India and Africa does, across the board, meet the double-digit test. Consistent growth in Watch, with a real momentum in OCR and in ad solutions. We don't talk a lot about the ad solutions piece, but it is a very robust business in our environment.","Next, just a brief update on investments that we have been making and talking to you for quite some time about. First, the investment that we made in coverage expansion in the United States, largely built on the inclusion of Wal-Mart data, but also included some other robust sources in other distribution arenas, has gone exceedingly well. It is done. The data's out. We've had very few reconciliation issues with our clients.","There's no question, the confidence in the read that we provide to them, week in and week out, has gone up.  And more importantly, it is fertile ground for analytics and insights, starting typically with assortment, moving through pricing, which will go on for quite some time, and then also, distribution alternatives.","In the buy developing world, which we talk about frequently, our priority investments are footprint expansions in Africa, China and India to provide for future growth. We remain fully committed to those initiatives. They remain on track. And I'll remind everybody that the long-term growth implications of these populations and the move into first-time consumption and middle class is huge and will continue for decades into the future.","Watch digital. OCR has gone very well. We love the adoption rate. We continue to take on more advertising campaigns, well over 1,000 at this stage. We have 70 advertisers and agencies involved and 60 publishers, and the use cases are apparent to all of the advertisers. The issues we faced in broad adoption typically revolved around how to embed it into the operating systems and ultimately, how the agencies best utilize it in servicing those clients. But we continue to expand our reach into the agency environment and like the progress that we're making.","XCR. This is, again, the sort of the cross-audience metric across these 2 mediums. We have a real opportunity with the Olympics and some very good robust advertisers to demonstrate the worth of XCR, and those are underway. And so we feel very good about the proof of XCR as a real tool for the -- both the agencies and advertisers.","And then finally, we completed an acquisition we've had our eyes on for quite a while, a company called Vizu, which does really a resonance metric or in effect, a \"how did the audience we reached react to the ad?\" And so Vizu sits right along OCR, gives us both reach and resonance. They have a robust technology platform and a terrific approach to the agency community. As an indication of our confidence and comfort with this program, we will be expanding into 6 countries before the end of this year and will continue our global expansion strongly into next year.","Finally, a program we've talked to you about for quite a while, which has just been announced and launched, which is a more robust metric around local TV. I'll remind everyone that stability of measurement in a very local television market has been an age-old problem for our company simply because of sample sizes. As we approached this problem, it was paramount that we maintain representation of the audiences that we measure, and therefore, we had to invent our way to a solution. We could not just take single forms of distribution data to the marketplace.","So part of this program involved the invention of a device called the code reader, which is a box about the size of an old cigarette box, that, in effect, reads the encoded signals on a wireless basis, so we have very little installation. It's a cost-effective box, and it is ubiquitous to all forms of devices and content distribution. And therefore, we can put it in a perfectly representative set of households and collect those signals regardless of how content is distributed. So we're very, very confident and believe we have a robust cost-effective answer here that will increase sample sizes anywhere from 2 to 4x their current levels and will solve the stability issue that our local clients have always had.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian West. He'll move into our financials.","Brian J. West","Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Page 9 of the slide deck, total Nielsen company results.","Revenue for the quarter came in at $1.385 billion. That's up 4%, solid growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $389 million. That's up 5% year-over-year constant currency. Regarding currency, as Dave mentioned, there was an impact for us, a 430 basis point drag on revenue and a 450 -- 415 basis point drag on adjusted EBITDA, which is just a reporting impact as we translate into U.S. dollars, which is why we measure the company on constant currency to reflect the underlying operating performance.","On adjusted margin rates, the rate for the quarter came in at 28.1%. That's 36 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, and it was 44 basis points of expansion on a reported basis. The state of margin expansion is both year-over-year and sequentially better as we continue our investment programs, as Dave mentioned. Adjusted net income came in at $157 million, and our diluted ANI per share came in at $0.42. Adjusted income was up 7% constant currency in the quarter and up 30% constant currency in the first half, reflective of the underlying earnings power of the model. And our free cash flow with a generation of $46 million, that's favorable year-over-year and sequentially.","Moving on to Page 10, segment revenue. I'll start with the buy business. The total buy business revenues came in at $849 million. That's up 3% year-over-year. Our information business was up 5%, which accounts for around 75% of our revenues. We saw growth in our information business across every region, reflective of the must-have nature of our data.","Within information, developed markets were up 3%; western Europe grew 2%; North America, high-single digits, as Dave mentioned. Developing markets were up 8%, and we saw growth in every region. Latin America, Asia, eastern Europe, India and Middle East, all faster growth.","Insights, the more discretionary part of the portfolio, was flat globally. Western Europe, as Dave mentioned, down close to 20%, reflective of that difficult operating environment, offset by North America growing high-single digits and developing markets up 6%. And notwithstanding the pressure in western Europe, the growth all around the world reminds us that -- the importance of our insights to our clients even when times are tough.","Moving on to the developing markets. For the quarter, revenue was up 7% impacted, as Dave mentioned, by the global multinationals, who are being more selective in certain markets. And for the first half it was up 9%. One thing I would point out is we've been here before, very high single-digit growth rate, back in '09. We know what this looks like and are confident that this reaccelerates as global clients get more confident. Ramp-up investment is high because we are the global player to give them that picture and that view in order for them to capture the growth.","On the Watch business, revenue came in at just under $500 million. That's up 4% year-over-year constant currency. And the core television audience measurement business grew 5%. A lot of confidence, as Dave mentioned, in our online program, particularly OCR. Our campaigns is now over 1,100 campaigns. As Dave mentioned, our confidence in investing is we're now going to go out into 6 more countries with the global platform that we've constructed and the relationship with Facebook.","On Expos, we're flat for the quarter. There's really some differences in show timing. First half, we'll be up 5% for Expos with good momentum.","So overall, solid broad-based growth across many parts of the portfolio, and we continue to have high level of visibility in revenue.","[Technical Difficulty]","Liz Zale","Sorry about that, everyone. We're going to go ahead and pick it back up at foreign currency impact on Slide 11.","Brian J. West","Yes, so one thing we try to do is help the investment community understand how currency impacts our business. If you look at year-to-date, our U.S. dollar exposure, our proportion of revenue was a bit higher than we saw last year. But we still have significant impact of FX translation in the quarter and for the rest of the year.","So we want to describe for everyone is how we expect that to happen for the balance of the year. Based on currency rates -- current rates and our expected revenue mix, we project 450 basis points of negative impact on the third quarter, 225 basis points of negative impact in the fourth quarter and 325 basis points of negative impact for the full year. All that is revenue impact.","And we expect slightly less impact on the adjusted EBITDA line based on how each region's profit contribution is converted into the U.S. dollar. So on EBITDA, we project 350 basis points of negative impact on the third quarter, 175 basis points of negative impact in the fourth quarter and 275 basis points of negative impact for the full year 2012. Again, that's based on current rates.","All of this is reporting representation. We report on constant currency. That reflects how we run the business and how the underlying operating performance of the model performs. And we've always done it this way. I would remind you that regardless of the foreign currency exchange swing, this is a story about revenue compounding growth and one that we feel very good about going forward.","Moving on to Page 12, on segment profitability. As I mentioned, for the quarter, EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA came in at $389 million. That's up 5%. You can see buy, at $169 million; Watch, $212 million; Expos at $14 million. One thing I would point out is we achieved margin expansion for all segments year-over-year and sequentially even as we had start-up costs related to the things like Wal-Mart or the continued expansion investments in the emerging markets. We will see margin expansion in the buy business in the second half, and we continue to see good profitability improvement in both Watch and Expos. This picture is a reminder not only do we have a commitment across leadership, but margins grow as our business grow just based on the underlying nature of our syndicated model.","Moving on to Page 13, the cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow for the quarter was a generation of $46 million, again, favorable year-over-year and sequentially. And this really is reflective of the usual pattern we see, the seasonality of our cash flows, and it's similar to last year's pattern, more favorable cash flow characteristics in the back half of the year.","CapEx was $70 million, more evenly distributed this year than last. Cash taxes in the quarter was $39 million and year-to-date, $62 million, which is driven by successful programs that we have around planning, as well as some timing. And I'll address this one a little bit more further on the full year guidance and our go-forward look.","Restructuring was $26 million for the quarter. The expense charge in the quarter was $16 million. That's down from a $37 million charge in the first quarter.","On the balance sheet side, the net debt ratio was 4x for the quarter. The loan balance increased slightly for short-term borrowings that offset mandatory debt repayments -- maturities, I should say. And the expectation is that we will have cash flow generation on the back half of the year, such that we're positioned to do voluntary debt repayments similar to last year. And the weighted average interest rate was essentially flat at 5.61%.","Moving on to Page 14, on 2012 guidance. Revenue growth still at 5.6% -- sorry, 5% to 6% constant currency. The benefit in the second half will be momentum in our North America buy business, driven by Wal-Mart, as we've discussed previously.","Margin expansion. For the first half, constant currency margin expansion was 20 basis points. On a reported basis, it was 29 basis points. So just a touch under the 30 basis points bottom end of the range, and that will accelerate in the second half, as our buy business primarily will expand margins. And that puts us in the full year at the 30 to 50 basis points range, both on reported and a constant-currency basis.","Adjusted net income will be 15% to 20% constant currency growth and EPS range of $1.76 next $1.82. Any negative impact from FX is offset by lower expectations for both cash taxes and depreciation and amortization, which I'll get to in a moment.","On the deleveraging side, 1\/2 turn reduction as we expect the cash flow conversion in the second half and voluntary debt paydowns as we close the year.","Couple of housekeeping items. CapEx, we're still at the same $340 million to $360 million. Restructuring, the same, $75 million to $100 million. The ones that are changed are in the middle: depreciation, amortization, $520 million to $530 million; net book interest, $520 million to $525 million; and then cash taxes, $135 million to $145 million  -- I'm sorry, net book interest is $420 million to $425 million. Cash tax is $135 million to $145 million.","And all of these are in line with what our first half results are and what our second half run rate expectations are. Cash tax number, based on, again, the planning, things that we're working on given the jurisdictions that we have and the assets that we have in the balance sheet. We'll have a cash tax rate in the 17% to 18% range, which is lower than the long-term guidance that we've given.","Finally, I would like to go to Page 15, the long-term financial framework. It's important that we want to provide clarity on the underlying drivers and expectations of the model and take a minute to put everything in context. Since January of 2011, we've used this financial framework to help describe what we view as the attributes of an incredible business model. And I think we'd like to take a minute to remind everyone of those attributes and how that aligns with where 2012 is going and where we think it's headed.","On the revenue side, in the information service business, with long-term contracts and the must-have data we have for our clients, our revenue growth is mid-single digits constant-currency basis. And even with a tougher global economy, we still see that in the mix for this year being 5% to 6%. And it's steady, and it's consistent. We've got 22 straight quarters of revenue growth, and this year is going to feel real good on that front. And our expectations for 2012 are right in line with the -- this long-term outlook.","On the adjusted EBITDA side, margin expansion, again, is within the range. It will be 30 to 50 basis points as we continue to remain committed on the investments that Dave talked about and we benefit from the scalable model where margins grow naturally as our business grows, and we see that, as well as work on cost management. Make no mistake that as we make investments to reinvest in the business, whether it's organic or an acquisition or due productivity, it must be a rigorous standard of payback. And we think about that a lot. And we think that, that accrues to our benefit over the long term.","On the developing market front, this is one where there's more near-term pressure. But as I mentioned, this is a moment in time. We've been here before. The big things that we feel very confident about are just the reasons why we're investing, which is that massive population growth in the emerging world, the under-penetration of our services and our local clients who are just starting to use our services. We're at the very early stages of building those local books of business. But we remain committed in building out that global footprint.","On the adjusted net income front, 2 to 3x EBITDA growth. This year, we'll be in that zip code. And on the adjusted net income, it's important to remind everyone, we do make certain adjustments to this number, such as including stock compensation charges  while excluding acquisition-related D&A. And these adjustments reflect the true earnings power of this business that will be incremental to shareholder value creation over time.","It's the way to look at our business, and we think some of these things differentiate us and our model, particularly on the front of the capital structure of the tax position. Capital structure, debt paydown and lower interest charges will accrue to the model and accrue to the benefits of the financial model and the cash taxes.","I've got great assets. I've got lots of jurisdictions, and I do planning all the time, which means the long-term range of a 20% to 25% cash tax rate -- we will be at the very low end of that range over the next several years because of the -- because of what we're seeing today from planning and we expect in the future. And that will all  go to benefit us on an ongoing basis.","And finally, on deleveraging. As we march on the path towards investment grade, we'll take leverage down, and we'll de-risk the balance sheet. And we have a proven track record of some level of leverage, and it's driven by the consistency of our cash flows. Our business continues to be highly valued by the debt capital markets, and it's reflected in our current pricing, which is at a premium at this moment. And we believe that, over time, as we get to the more appropriate capital structure, we're going to move towards a model that will benefit equity holders over time for sure. So just a reminder in terms of how we view the business going forward and how we put that in context to this year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Liz.","Liz Zale","Great. Rocco, we'll go ahead and start the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, Brian and Liz, when talking about the expected constant-currency revenue growth acceleration implied in the second half from the full year guidance, will this all come from the AOC, inclusive of Wal-Mart database? Will all that lift be in buy information? And will buy insights rebound on a lag basis?","Brian J. West","The AOC will be a big part of it, for sure. And we're not expecting big robust recoveries in the insights business in the back half.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And but you do think that buy insights maybe, let's call it, moving out to 2013 will have a ricochet-effect of having the lift once the customers have the AOC database for a while?","Brian J. West","Yes, for sure. We still feel like there is a tailwind over time on our analytics business related to our U.S. book of business related to that AOC or Wal-Mart as we previously referred to it as. No doubt about it.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last little bit. AOC has a set-up cost. I know customers pay a one-time fee. Is that a significant portion of the third quarter?","Brian J. West","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suzi Stein of Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess just a follow-up on that question. I just want to make sure I understand your confidence in the revenue growth in the back half of the year. I know that you can't really break it down specifically, but how much of the Wal-Mart boost is actually signed contracts versus just simple price increases that you're putting through for increased service? And also, what's implied in your numbers for western Europe in the second half?","Brian J. West","So the way we're rolling out the year, everything is contracted. And so we're not -- there's no -- we're not guessing that there's some giant lift that we don't see in a very, very clearly way with respect Wal-Mart and data and even insight as it relates to that. With respect western Europe, we expect nothing to get better. So the down 20% is a -- we'll extrapolate that in the second half. I will tell you the actions we took at the end of last year and the implementation of the restructuring is accruing wonderful benefits there. So we pat ourselves on the back for having gotten ahead of that one and to know that the restructuring benefits accrue through, at least, the middle of next year. And we have some great ideas on how to sort of remodel that service delivery. Last reminder, even though rough, rough, rough space, information services \"how am I doing?\" is going quite well. It's very steady, it has not declined. In fact, it has grown even in this tough environment.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I mean, just a follow-up, I just wanted to get a little more clarity on what we should expect as far as price increases, maybe over the next 12 months, just as Wal-Mart is incorporated. I mean, will the price increases be sort of outsized just based on the improvement in service?","Brian J. West","There's no doubt that as we report our third quarter results, you will see a pickup in our information business largely because of this onetime benefit we see with the new data and the value that we receive for that. And that will happen for 4 quarters.  I'd rather not use the word price. This is a -- it's a contracted revenue for an improved service.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just get one follow-up. Just on the local markets, can you just talk about the size of that business and maybe the size of the recent investment?","Brian J. West","Well, as we have said before, the long tail, the diary end of our local market is less than 1% of total company revenue. And while we're not disclosing the amount of the investments, make no mistake, as we've been working on this technology, it was always geared towards making sure that it could be economically and financially viable for this long tail of a market. And that's one of the important return directionals that we put on any project. And it's within the framework we always talk about, our investment governors. We always talk about margin reinvestments as a function of margin expansion, and we also talk about CapEx as a function of the reinvestment ratio. And that program will be within those governors.","David L. Calhoun","Yes. And in fact, even amongst -- as measured against other programs, it will not register high in that list.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Karimzad of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the emerging market deceleration, are we in a situation where it's a few customers pulling back meaningfully or a situation where it's many of them pulling back modestly? And any more geographic color you can offer versus what you talked about last quarter would be helpful. And I have a follow-up.","David L. Calhoun","I'm going to be careful because I don't have a total analysis sitting in front of me, but I believe it's the former. In other words, it's a few big guys who are retrenching in some ways and are drawing back, and I think if you read most of the CPG headlines you'd figure out which.","Brian J. West","Yes, Brian, that's actually completely accurate.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what is the customer concentration in that business relative to the company as a whole? I mean, intuitively it sounds like that's one we are more concentrated saying about big customers?","Brian J. West","The way I would think about it is in some of these markets, there is more multinationals because they're earlier stage. And they will be -- feel more concentrated. And then other markets that have been more mature, such as Latin America, you'll have more local clients. It really depends on the market. It just so happens that at this moment in time, big global multinationals, I think, as Dave mentioned, because of their developed pressures are just being resource-scarce, and we're seeing the effect of that. What I would also offer is that in many markets, our local clients are accelerating growth. They're just not, overall, as big as the big multinationals.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then for your outlook for the balance of the year, you're assuming no acceleration in the growth rate from what we've seen in 2Q?","David L. Calhoun","Yes. No, we've extrapolated -- in our guidance, we always extrapolate conservatively, and so we're not expecting the developing world to jump back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just on that developing market topic again. Can you give us a sense of which developing markets are being the most impacted? And then have you pulled back investment in your developing market initiatives?","David L. Calhoun","I'll let Brian comment after me. But no, we haven't pulled back. Our priority markets, remember, the big investments relate to big footprint expansions in free markets, Africa, which, by the way, we have very little revenue attached to anyway simply because we're building a first-time metric, India and China. And so if you aggregate them, we are, in fact, growing double digits against that investment. The real drawdown has been in more ancillary countries, which, again, our clients prioritize. And so Southeast Asian perimeter has been tough. Middle East, of course, is tough for other reasons. And so that's really where we're feeling most of the pressure.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then it's actually the other detail in the FX exposure. What's the margin expansion impact for the year that you're expecting from the FX headwind?","Brian J. West","For the year, total year margin expansion will be right in line with total constant currency. So 30 to 50 basis points at this moment in time for the year would be both on a constant-currency and reported basis.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then with the insights business, what was the growth rate in North American insights? I missed that. And then, would you expect an acceleration in insights within North America because of the Wal-Mart inclusion in the back half?","David L. Calhoun","No, our insights business in North America was high-single digits. And over the longer term, and that we don't know precisely when, that will feel frothy as people spend more on analytics given the new set of data. I just don't know how much or when. But it's a nice tailwind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is there any reason to think that Watch revenue growth should ramp in the second half versus the first half?","David L. Calhoun","What I would say to that one is that our Watch business historically grows 4% to 5%. Looking back, it's done that very consistently and very steady basis. And up to this point, year-to-date, it's not quite there yet. But I expect the future to look a lot like history.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you maybe talk about what's been dragging it in the first half of the year?","David L. Calhoun","Well, it was really the first quarter. We grew 3% because there were some discrete comps that it was up against. That's gone away. As I mentioned in the second quarter, Watch grew 4%, which is the sequential acceleration of the growth rate, and that's going to get better in the second half.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of online campaign ratings, any change to the timing of when you think that should start to really contribute to revenue growth? Is it something that we would begin to see at all in the second half of the year? Or is it more 2013?","David L. Calhoun","Yes. No, I -- on a measured basis, you'll -- 2013 is when you'll start to talk to us about it. It's taken longer than I'd like, but I like -- I really do like the penetration and the confidence that we're seeing in each of the necessary constituents. I think probably I underestimated the importance of the agency role and their ability to ingrain it into their systems, et cetera. But I really do like it. I will also tell you the sort of the immediate impact is on video because video, of course, is the higher-value component and it is clearly being attached to that faster. And if you look at the upfronts and some of the guarantees that were built around OCR, I expect that to continue maybe more robustly here as we finish the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe you could draw -- drill down a little bit further into the U.S. buy performance, which you highlighted was strong in the quarter. It sounds like Wal-Mart was a small contributor, but any commentary about short- versus long-cycle revenue and potential reallocation from your slow-growing Western markets into the U.S., if that happened at all?","Brian J. West","Well, what I would say is, as Dave mentioned, there wasn't a whole lot of Wal-Mart in the numbers in the second quarter. That will be a back half benefit. And there really wasn't much of a difference between info and insights. Those books did very well in the North America business. And our view is that, right now, if you look at a shaky world view, North America is something people are being more confident on, and we're seeing that.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are you seeing some of your customers explicitly reallocate into the U.S.? Or did they just remain confident in the domestic market in and of itself?","Brian J. West","I wouldn't say -- I'd hate to say reallocate. I think what they've done as they have tried to become more productive, broadly speaking, they have come down a little more relative to their historic spending. And again, we're talking about a few selected clients in the developing world relative to the U.S. market. Everybody's reacting to Europe. So I mean, that's a drawdown across the board. But if we're talking about the U.S., I wouldn't say they're our reallocating into it. It's just that they're going to sustain those investments and I think, drawdown on others.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And TV did 5.7% constant currency. It seems like a good number. Can you talk about what's driving that?","David L. Calhoun","Our TV business around the world is a very steady consistent grower to great platform. You get all the benefits of that model, and you also have the benefit of other things like ancillary analytics that perform well particularly in this market. So just an overall good quarter, but it's a consistent quarter.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last housekeeping item. I know maybe it's a little bit early to talk about the cash tax rate for next year, but it seems to be moving around quite a bit. Any indication whether or not 2013 can remain at this level? Or any way to think about what that could be for next year?","Brian J. West","I'm not going to give you a number for next year, but I will tell you that the last 2 years -- this year, as I mentioned, will be in the 17% to 18% rate base, what I just told you for full year. Last year was around the same zip code. And while our long-term projection was always 20%, 25%, it feels like over the next several years it's going to be at the low end of that range for the foreseeable future. What exactly next year looks like, I don't know. But I think that it's kind of range-bound in that kind of zip code I just gave you. We've got more planning opportunity than you can imagine. We work on them all day. That's the benefit you're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur of Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Brian, I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit on the adjusted constant currency EBITDA performance to the 2 segments. I mean, buy seemed a little light. Watch seemed very strong. I'm wondering how much of that is timing and\/ investment spending?","Brian J. West","Doug, good question. So our buy business, while we are reinvesting primarily in the developing market footprint and the Wal-Mart startup cost, that is impacting the leverage, where EBITDA has only grown 1% constant currency. As I mentioned, in the second half, the buy business will begin to accelerate, meaning, that it will have more operating leverage. The EBITDA will grow faster than the bottom line -- top line rather, as a result of the Wal-Mart experience being behind us. On the Watch business, there's nothing timing-related, it's just consistent and steady.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One is what needs to happen, in your opinion, to see a re-acceleration in the spending in the emerging markets?","Brian J. West","Oh boy, we get -- so we just have to reduce anxiety about what's going on in the world. And I hate to say all roads lead to European financial markets, but I happen to believe that. I just think there is an angst out there that you can feel and touch, and everyone is being a little -- just being a little hesitant to run full speed. There are some isolated problems with big players that they're reacting to. And they happen to be significant and good clients of ours. I mean, I can't really add anymore to that, but I am not anticipating a fast or big recovery absent some -- Europe beginning to settle down.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then in terms of looking at the EBITDA margins. You've talked about kind of a longer term 100 to 150 basis point-type expansion potential. Near term, we're running at 30 to 50. Just wanted to know if you could review for us some of the investments you're doing in terms of the quantitation to bridge those 2.","Brian J. West","Yes, so Bill, we had said 100 basis points was the top end. When you get to a 1 to 2x revenue, that's about what you get. And that's if we didn't reinvest $0.05 for growth. Now it just so happens that we're in the mode of building businesses and trying to grow this platform over the long term, and it's really reflected in our commitment to build out the developing market footprint. And as Dave mentioned, Africa, India, China right now is where we're investing ahead of clients, so that in the next 2 to 3 years we will have the incremental growth as they go there to attract their next consumer. So it's all consistent with what we said. We hope we're in growth mode. We're not in the mood to stop investing in those developing markets because they're just too powerful, too important, too important to our clients for the long term.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And one housekeeping question, what's the British pound as a percentage of revenue, approximately?","Liz Zale","Well, anything lower than the euro -- anything outside the euro is less than 10%. It is in the low-single digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Flynn of Credit Suisse.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify some of your earlier comments on western Europe and general macro assumptions. So with respect to the back half or constant currency growth, excluding Wal-Mart, are you assuming total constant-currency revenue growth remains about the same in the back half as it was in Q2? Are you assuming it gets a little bit worse on an underlying basis?","Brian J. West","I'm not quite sure how to pick apart that question only to say that, as Dave mentioned, we're not forecasting in the second half anything recovering for sure. And we're trying to call this as conservative as we can.","Liz Zale","Yes, I think, Kelly, I would just add to that, that as both Dave and Brian said, the impact relating to the addition of Wal-Mart is contracted, and we are already starting to see revenue for that. And we will see the full benefit of that starting in the third quarter. So this as certain as something can be.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, that I understand. I guess what I'm trying to get at -- yes, I mean, it's clear you're not assuming an improvement. But I think if there would be a concern, it would be that it looks like things are getting worse in western Europe and potentially, in the developing markets. So it would seem reasonable that you might actually assume that both western Europe declines and developing market growth would actually worsen in the second half of the year, and I'm trying to understand if your conservatism bakes in worsening or does it just assume no improvement.","Brian J. West","So here's the way I think about it. It starts with our information business, right? the big part of -- and this is all buy side, by the way. The Watch side is kind of over in the kind of consistent historical pattern I already mentioned, the 4% to 5% range. If you think about -- which only will accelerate in the back half, as I've mentioned. On the buy side, our information business, which is 75% of the revenues in the second quarter, it grew 5%. It is under long-term contract, and we had broad growth even in western Europe. So that is the safety, the consistency and the security of that part of the business under long-term contract. The insights, it will ebb and flow depending upon the region of the world. Western Europe was down 20%, and that's something that if it got a little bit worse, I don't think that's going to necessarily impact the broader portfolio. We're not assuming things get any better, and I think given the information business, the size of it and the consistency of it, it's just going to do just fine. Our insights business in 2009, it didn't grow a lot either, and the business held up beautifully.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then just switching gears again, touching on something that came up earlier. I just want to clarify. On OCR and this local stuff that you're talking about, are you assuming any material incremental revenue in the back half from either one of those? Or is it all Wal-Mart that's causing the acceleration?","Brian J. West","It's Wal-Mart.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Quick question, as I think of 3Q versus 4Q, should I assume normal seasonality? Or is there any kind of a meaningful lift from the Olympics, sort of any particular pattern changes because of Wal-Mart?","Brian J. West","With the exception of what we talked about in terms of Wal-Mart just being higher revenues, that'll happen equally over the back half. Other than that, there's no real seasonality in the top line that we would expect.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of just the expenses, the cost side of things, is there any particular pattern for the investments you are making?","Brian J. West","There isn't. But I would point you towards the historical expansions of margins in the second half tends to be more heavily weighted in the fourth quarter for a variety of reasons. The only thing that seasonality, that you'll back historically and see will likely be the same pattern going forward. But it has nothing to do with our investment ramp or profile.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And one question on OCR, and you guys have mentioned a few times now. 2013 would be when we start seeing some material revenues from that or at least measurable revenues from OCR. Are you looking at, I mean, any particular time frame within 2013? And from an external standpoint as investors, data need, sort of data point we can look at or measure to see how OCR specifically is performing.","Brian J. West","I've proven that I can't call that quarter. So I'm going to just continue to update you on sort of where we are, whether we're penetrating these markets. And as soon as I can call a quarter and call your attention to revenue, I will, I promise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen of Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Two questions please. One is, once again on OCR, not about the numbers or the timing, but could you please explain what it takes to make this a more standardized measurement tool for online ratings? I just want to understand what the process is, what you need to do and how your customers and all customers in the market are thinking about making that a standard. And then secondly, based on the comments you've made about slowdown in the emerging markets, is there anything you can say about how you think advertising trends look there right now?","Brian J. West","Advertising trends in emerging markets, okay. Let me start with the first one. So to become a standard, first of all, you have to define a product that has the ability to be a standard. So that's why we defined this OCR product as simply a reach metric, so who did my video or my display ad reach in the marketplace. We built a product that allows for an immediate turnaround and metric on an actual campaign, which previously did not exist. It was a -- sort of the formal representations were panel-based, didn't give the kind of data to advertisers or agencies that allowed it to be directly compared to the alternative medium or complementary medium, television. We created a new product that had the ability to become a currency, and I still believe that, that is the case. First you have to convince advertisers broadly that they want that accountability, that they want to buy guaranteed audiences. That's not that hard, except you have got to get them all to experiment with it and understand exactly what it will tell them relative to today's campaign experiences. That's actually going quite well. The second big part of the puzzle is you want publishers to understand what that metric is going to mean to them because previously they all sold their services under typically captive metrics or potentially a planning metric that either we or comScore or a few others had sort of represented. And when be present the OCR, the actual reach metric, if it is something less than what have been previously represented, there is a hesitancy to call attention to it. So you have to sort of get them to want to embrace it and understand how to use it to their favor. The people where it represents very, very well and robust, people like Facebook, where the representation of audience had always had a high level of integrity, these -- it's a very good thing, and it gets embraced very quickly. The toughest  piece of the puzzle is the crowd that stands between everybody, which is the agencies, who buy and sell media, buy and sell the medium, help the advertisers plan audiences. They have to learn how to sort of embed it in their systems, how to buy differently, do they want to guarantee audiences across both mediums. It's not a small matter for them to think about how to ingrain it into their business model. We've had a few that just quickly jumped out of the gates, embraced it and built their own products around it, around both which has been great. Group M, I  would call your attention to, but they're all beginning to understand the benefits of the accountability metric. And I'm out there with them all the time, our teams are. And so I feel very good about that. And they tell me every day be patient, just be patient. And so that's what we're being, and we're going to continue to stick with that, believing that this is the right way to build a currency. I'm sorry, the second question. Advertising in emerging markets. I don't have a number sitting on the top of my head and I don't -- other than the number of inquiries and discussions we have around it. We don't have big Watch businesses out there and so we don't -- we're not as directly involved in that. So I'd rather not comment because I'd probably be guessing and speculating.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz of Piper Jaffray.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just had one question. I'm curious. As it relates to the buy segment, to what extent might the incremental Wal-Mart contribution be offset by cuts and ad hoc project work both either short term or long term?","Brian J. West","Yes, it's a great question, and that potential always exists. We have not seen no indication of it occurring. And here is the real dynamic that goes on inside these businesses is, \"Okay, I've got all this information, and other guys are using it to their benefit. I better be using it to my benefit.\" So you end up with this sort of big pressure with new data, wanting to build new analytics versus cost control. So far we have not seen sort of that cost-control element overtake the former. And we're very attentive to that, but so far, so good.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess I had one other question. I know you had mentioned in the past that your China domestic growth was growing in about 1.5x your multinational growth there. Just curious. Are you still seeing strong growth trends in China domestically?","Brian J. West","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bishop Cheen of Wells Fargo.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So my question is not an emerging markets question. Actually 2 to quick questions. One, looking at your balance sheet near term, you really pared everything down. What do you got? Maybe between now and 2014, $300 million or something of maturities, coming up, $260 million in '13 and $200 million in '14. Have I missed something?","Brian J. West","Yes. That's about right.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's certainly not a mountain, and that answers my own question. And brings me to competition.","Brian J. West","Just on that one, Bishop, don't forget the one thing that we are going to very opportunistically address, and we think about it all the time, are the ones that become callable in May and June of next year. So there's $800 million of high coupon notes that become callable that we're very focused on.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's on the first call stuff of...","Brian J. West","The 11.5 and the 8.5.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","'17?","Brian J. West","Yes, exactly, the 2017, 8.5s, and then the 11.5s.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay, yes. As focused as you should be, you have arbitraged your balance sheet for 6 years to a positive advantageous tone for you. And then competition, which I guess kind of gets lost in all worry about the macroeconomic. Can you just give us a little color on where you see competition North America? Clearly, we get to see the Newswire all the time, and it's all about the competition to the Watch segment. Can you give us color how you think about whatever competition is out there or company?","Brian J. West","Yes. So across the board, I believe we are gaining share. The competitive circumstance in developing world, we feel advantaged. We will continue to feel even more advantaged as we build first-time footprints. In the watch world, the typical headline that you read about or that I get questioned about, I'll just to put in some perspective. We grew our Watch business here, just television, roughly $30 million in the first half. You can add up all the gains by all the other guys, you'll like the share. You'll like the share gain in the first half, I'm pretty sure. It's just -- I feel good about it. I feel good about the investments we have that whatever competitors have surfaced are going to face in the next 12 or 18 months. In the buy business where we do face tough competitors in certain developed markets, there has -- it's been a very stable market share world. I'm very happy with our position. If anything, I believe we've been in a slight gain position for 6 straight years. And so I feel very good about all of that. And the only space that is a total fight forever is digital. That's just life. There are people coming at it from 1,000 directions. We believe there is one opportunity, one, in the digital space to create a competitive advantage with the size and scale that we're used to, and that is in a reach metric for display and for video consumption. And that's exactly what we have attempted to do. Otherwise, we will compete with all the rest in resident metrics and other things on marketing effectiveness. And we love that business. It's a good one. But that one will be a -- always a big battle with lots and lots of new entrants.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Atorino from Benchmark.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","That's a great segue way into my question. I was going to ask, what are you doing to address the explosion in viewing alternatives: Apple iPads, telephones, et cetera. There have been a couple of articles that you have some developments in place to go after those, I guess call them, audiences. Could you elaborate a little bit?","Brian J. West","Yes. Well, we develop technology on a continuous basis to capture signals in each and every one of the devices. That goes actually quite well. That's not the hard part. We have technology that will capture video in an iPad. We have technology that will capture video in all these devices. And what we do as we go down that path is then, we work with the various industry interest, the distributors, the content providers, et cetera. In effect, validate it for them and with them and then ultimately, try to get it included in the video metrics. So the fact that our OCR metric is wanting to be combined with the TV metric is all about their desire to capture bigger audiences on all devices. So we're confident. We're comfortable that we're heading down the right path. We understand our clients' objectives to measure all eyeballs. But there are lots of industry industries -- interest that have to get navigated. And we just continue to work on that and continue to do it. But I feel good about it. I'm confident. Technology is not, is not a hurdle.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Will this mean more discreet-type products like OCR or just sort of a family products?","Brian J. West","OCR will be sort of device ubiquitous in that regard. And so for us, it's just a question of, in effect, getting the distributors to engage with us and embed the device in the apps because apps often deliver signal.","Liz Zale","I believe that's the end of our questions. Is that right, operator?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. No further questions.","Liz Zale","Great. Well, thank you, again, to everyone for joining us today. Certainly look forward to continuing our interactions with you as we head into the end of summer. And we'll see you as conference season starts back up in September. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the Nielsen Holdings N.V. Second Quarter 2012 Call.  A replay of this call will be available on the Nielsen Investor Relations website shortly.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen\u2019s second quarter financial performance. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer; and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A slide presentation that we\u2019ll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen\u2019s view as of today, July 27, 2017.

[Operator Instructions]","And now to start the call, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start today with some comments on the ongoing change in our business and the markets we serve. We see change as a source of opportunity even if it comes with challenges. In fact, all throughout our history, we captured new growth opportunities by responding to market changes with resolve and innovation. Faced with an unprecedented pace of change in both Watch and Buy, we\u2019re following that same tradition today. Leveraging change is a means for progress by innovating the services we provide to our clients and driving value for our shareholders. Our mission is to provide a clear and complete understanding of consumers and markets. That has not changed. But the way we do it is changing rapidly and in exciting ways, and that will continue in the years ahead.","With that said, Jamere will now review the financials, which include an update to our revenue guidance for 2017. I\u2019ll then come back with some specific business highlights and a look into our future. Jamere?","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. Overall, our business continues to deliver growth and margin expansion in a challenging environment. In our Buy segment, revenue remains weak as a result of challenging fast-moving consumer goods environment in the U.S. However, we continue to drive growth across the rest of the business in both Watch and Buy while also delivering margin expansion. This is indicative of the strength of the portfolio and the resiliency of this business.","Let me give a few more details on our total company performance in the second quarter. On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just over $1.64 billion, up 3% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in Buy, partially offset by 110 basis points of currency headwind and continued softness in our U.S. Buy market. Net income was $131 million, and net income per share was $0.37. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and lower restructuring charges.","Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was up 4.1% constant currency. The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately two points to our revenue growth. Our core revenue, which we define as total revenue less noncore or nonstrategic assets, grew 7.6% constant currency in the quarter and just under 4% excluding the Gracenote acquisition. I\u2019ll provide more color on the segments in just a few moments.","Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million, up 4.9% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.1%, up 25 basis points on a constant-currency basis. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we are running the productivity play with intensity and delivering cost efficiencies which help us expand margins and fund growth initiatives like electronic measurement in diary markets, expanding coverage in Buy and funding the Connected System.","Free cash flow was $162 million, which was a record second quarter and was up 65.3% versus a year ago. We remain on track for our full year plan of approximately $900 million to fuel growth and return cash to our shareholders.","Next, I\u2019ll move to the segments, starting with Watch. And the key takeaway is that our Watch segment continues to perform well and is delivering solid revenue and EBITDA growth. Revenue was $821 million, up 10.9% constant currency. Excluding Gracenote, Watch revenue grew 3.5% constant currency. Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 16% and excluding Gracenote grew 4.7% constant currency, led by strength in total Audience Measurement.","In addition to strength in national TV, we continue to see momentum in Digital Ad Ratings and Digital Content Ratings. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns grew 33% in the quarter, and we now have over 400 advertisers using the product, including all of the top 25 in the U.S. Digital Content Ratings also continue to see strong momentum as we increased penetration among top digital publishers, including Facebook.","As expected, Audio was flat in the quarter. Marketing effectiveness was up 18.6% constant currency as we leverage our Watch and Buy assets to help advertisers and publishers measure the return on investment and media spend. Other Watch was down 17.2% due to exiting part of the telecom product offerings in the U.S. and the exit of our legacy net ratings product in the U.S., which is being replaced by Digital Content Ratings. We also exited a content testing asset in the quarter as we continue to execute on our plan to prune noncore assets from the portfolio.","Watch adjusted EBITDA was $357 million, up 8.2% constant currency. Watch margins were 43.5%, down 1.1 points. Excluding 145 basis points drag from Gracenote, Watch margins were up more than 30 basis points constant currency, driven by productivity improvements. Our Watch business continues to perform well and is delivering solid revenue and EBITDA growth.","Turning to Buy. The key takeaway here is that revenue declines and margins were slightly better than 1Q as we navigate a tough U.S. market. The rest of the developed markets remain resilient, and we see ongoing strength in emerging markets.","Second quarter total Buy revenue was $823 million, down 2% constant currency. Core Buy revenue was up 2.7% constant currency. Our revenue in the developed markets was $510 million, down 1.2% constant currency behind continued weakness in the U.S., partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in the remaining developed markets. The U.S. business, which is just under half of the developed market revenue, improved sequentially.","Now, let me provide some additional color on what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. We continue to benefit from strong long term contract renewals with our largest clients. However, as we have discussed, some of these clients are seeing challenging market conditions and cycling through significant cost cuts. And as a result, they make near term decisions about some of our products and services as they lower overall spend. We know that our measurement and analytics are critical and that, over time, clients must invest in the data they need to run their businesses. And in the second quarter, we saw this dynamic play out to some extent as clients spent a bit more behind some of their data and analytics needs.","Our business in the emerging markets remains robust. Revenue was $296 million, up 10% constant currency. The bets we have made to expand coverage and services are delivering broad based growth with both multinationals and locals. Once again, we saw strong growth in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Greater China. In addition, margins in our emerging markets are expanding as we gain scale in key markets.","Our Corporate Buy revenue was down 69%, reflecting our pruning of noncore Buy assets. Buy EBITDA was $163 million, down 1.8% constant currency in the second quarter. Our disciplined cost and commercial actions, along with improving operating leverage in the emerging markets, drove a slight increase in EBITDA margins despite a decline in total revenue.","Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don\u2019t take on transactional risk so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 110 basis points drag on revenue and a 40 basis points drag on EBITDA. If yesterday\u2019s spot rates hold constant through 2017, then we expect a 40 basis points benefit on revenue and a 70 basis points benefit on EBITDA for the full year.","Moving to 2017 guidance, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.46 and free cash flow guidance of approximately $900 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to plus 20 basis points, a constant currency expansion as a result of our cost out actions. We\u2019re lowering our total revenue guidance to approximately 4% to reflect our first half results, our outlook in developed Buy and some updated timing on noncore product exits. This includes approximately 6% core revenue growth and approximately 3% core revenue growth excluding Gracenote. There are no changes to our expectations for other financial metrics provided on the right hand side of the page.","And as we look at 2017 revenue growth, a few dynamics are playing out: one, our Watch business remains solid; two, we continue to see robust growth in the emerging markets; and three, we continue to plan for a tough U.S. market. We now expect developed Buy revenue to be down 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis for 2017. In the U.S., we expect the second half to continue to improve versus the first half, though not enough to land us at our prior guidance. We are not forecasting an improvement in the market environment for the back half of 2017.","However, a review of our revenue pipeline for 2018, which includes renewals and new business, suggests an improvement in our business in 2018. This, along with an improving market environment, suggests a return to flat revenue in developed Buy for the full year for 2018 versus 2017. And lastly, we remain committed to our balanced capital structure that is funding growth while enabling us to return cash to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and share buybacks.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mitch to provide more color on the quarter.","Mitch Barns","Yes. Thanks, Jamere. Well, as you can see, we executed well in a challenging market, and I\u2019d first like to thank our teams for the rigorous cost discipline they demonstrated in the quarter. It enabled us to expand margins while continuing to invest in our key growth initiatives.","Let\u2019s look at the segments. First, Watch. Throughout our history, we\u2019ve adapted to and benefited from media fragmentation and advances in technology. We\u2019ve seen this over the years as cable came along and then satellite, later followed by time-shifted viewing and digital and mobile and subscription video-on-demand. In response to all these, we innovated and introduced new offerings, and so today, we measure all of those viewing options. We are the currency measurement standard, and we fuel our clients\u2019 trading across all screens and platforms in this fragmented market. This is due to successful execution of Total Audience Measurement.","Through all of those changes, one thing that\u2019s held true is this: the market needs high-quality, independent third-party measurement. In fact today, it\u2019s more critical than ever for all types of media engagement, mass reach-based advertising, targeted segment-based advertising and subscription services. The representative persons-based measurement that underpins our Total Audience system will remain the foundation for the future, whether media buyers and sellers want to transact on age and gender or on more targeted buys. At the end of the day, advertisers want to know who they reached, and Nielsen is the only one who can answer that question comprehensively and with the quality and independence the market requires.","I want to highlight three key points that underscore the endurance of our strong position in measurement and our ability to create new opportunities. First, we\u2019re well positioned for the future with Total Audience Measurement, our system that provides independent, comparable and deduplicated measurement of both content and ads across all platforms. Second, we made great progress towards establishing our position as the digital standard, and we see significant growth opportunities ahead. Third, we\u2019re investing in new datasets, audience-based buying, ROI metrics and sports, all of which represent attractive incremental growth opportunities for our Watch segment.","Let me address these points in a little more detail. First, Total Audience Measurement. We\u2019ve successfully delivered all of the components of Total Audience Measurement to the market. We significantly expanded the range of viewing captured by the C3\/C7 currency metric for linear ad models. And for dynamic ad models, our Digital Ad Ratings metric has emerged as the market standard. We\u2019re now leveraging the flexibility of our Total Audience system to drive increased usage. Today, clients are buying and transacting on all elements of the system.","Here are a few recent highlights. Within linear television, out-of-home has had a stellar reception since its April launch. Out-of-home is important for sports, and both ESPN and FOX Sports have signed on. Most recently, they were joined by Turner Sports and CNN, with CNN already having closed deals that include out-of-home.","Another highlight is our Digital in TV Ratings product. This expands the C3\/C7 currency to capture linear viewing of ads seen on PCs and mobile devices, whether it\u2019s live viewing, DVR or video-on-demand. Just this week, we announced that viewing on YouTube TV and Hulu\u2019s live TV service is now being credited to DTVR. This brings us to eight digital distributors, including several of the so called skinny bundles, contributing directly to our national TV ratings. This is really big news because a large portion of cord-cutters are switching to these skinny bundles, and when they do, we\u2019re measuring them. It\u2019s an undeniable fact that currency quality, cross-platform measurement is here and in the market today and only Nielsen can deliver it.","We\u2019ve also seen further adoption of Digital Ad Ratings, the emerging industry standard for dynamic ad models. We recently expanded our coverage to include mobile apps from YouTube and Pinterest.","For Digital Content Ratings, the latest news involves secondary crediting for participating publishers for all of their video content, both live and on-demand, distributed through the Facebook platform, providing them with a comprehensive picture of their audience no matter where people interact with their content. For subscription video-on-demand, the number of episodes measured continues to grow. It\u2019s now at 31,000, up 6,000 from last quarter. It\u2019s important for content owners to understand their viewership on these platforms, which is why we\u2019re seeing the growing demand here.","On Total Content Ratings, nearly every network is receiving and using their data. We recently added additional flexibility in the Total Content Ratings user interface to make it easier for media owners when they want to share their viewership data with agencies who actually like the flexibility of the system. We\u2019re also pushing more data from our Total Audience Measurement system into Nielsen Media Impact. This is our planning solution that came to us through our acquisition of a Pointlogic in early 2016. The reason why this matters is because it helps our clients plan and monetize inventory more effectively in a cross-platform world. Just last week, we began including VOD content ratings for nine networks, showcasing their high-quality ad inventory to advertisers and agencies.","The second key point I want to make is around the progress and opportunity we see in digital. We get a lot of questions about our digital opportunity and how we\u2019re monetizing it as digital share of ad spending grows. One question we often get is, will we get paid as much for measurement of digital as we do for TV? The answer is a function of two things; first, value, meaning how much clients are willing to pay for digital measurement; and second, volume or the percent of digital video advertising that trades based on independent third-party measurement. The data show that value is already strong. The bigger growth opportunity will come from increasing volume. We\u2019re already getting a boost from the growing call by advertisers for independent third-party measurement on digital platforms. As more premium video is viewed in a digital format and as the market matures, we expect more of the market to be measured.","This is why we\u2019re relentless in our focus on driving adoption of our Total Audience components, expanding the range of use cases, adding flexibility and improving the user interface of our tools. It\u2019s all aimed at driving increased usage or volume. We see lots of opportunity here, and working to our advantage is the fact that only Nielsen has the currency quality measurement and the comprehensive coverage of the consumer that the market requires. That said, our opportunity is broader than just monetizing advertising spend. As the industry has evolved, we\u2019re delivering products to help our clients realize more value from their media and advertising in a variety of ways, including cross-media planning, digital targeting, activation and sales lift analytics.","And this brings me to my third point. We\u2019re investing proactively to keep pace with the ongoing change in the market, constantly innovating to create incremental growth opportunities for our business. One recent example is our Gracenote acquisition. This was a great stand-alone business, but it\u2019s even better as a part of Nielsen. Gracenote\u2019s metadata, which covers video, sports and music, is driving growth opportunities with pay TV operators and streaming media services who are leveraging Gracenote\u2019s data to deliver powerful new user features like voice search and discovery. And Gracenote\u2019s automatic content recognition technology opens up new datasets for Nielsen\u2019s measurement and analytics products, lots of opportunity ahead of us here. A hot topic in the market today is the shift in ad spend towards audience-based buying, and some of you have asked how our portfolio will fit in this more targeted environment. In fact, we\u2019re a leader in this area, innovating with our investments in Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Nielsen Buyer Insights. Today, audience segments from these products are the standard for CPG and retail advertising planning. Combine that with our 2015 acquisition of eXelate, now a key part of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, and you see that we operate from a strong position. Our persons-based measurement is the key to this. Targeting involves people, and that\u2019s what we measure. Now this is another area full of opportunity for us.","Most of what we\u2019re doing here falls into Marketing Effectiveness, which grew 19% constant currency in the quarter. The latest news here is our collaboration with JD.com, the giant online retailer in China, for a new multi-touch attribution product to support targeted advertising. This will be the first time that Nielsen will leverage JD\u2019s big data to connect both Watch and Buy at the shopper level.","To sum up the overall picture for our Watch business, Total Audience is gaining adoption, digital remains a growth engine and Marketing Effectiveness is an area of strength. And finally, we\u2019ll keep investing for the future, so as the market continues to evolve, we\u2019ll continue to capture the emerging growth opportunities.","In our Buy business, it\u2019s still a two-speed world. Our business in the emerging markets again excelled with constant-currency revenue growth of 10%, and our investments in coverage and granularity drove double-digit growth in Latin America and Eastern Europe, along with high single-digit growth in Southeast Asia and China.","In developed markets, late last year, we began planning for the tougher environment in 2017, particularly in the U.S., and we continue to see that play out as our fast-moving consumer goods clients are faced with unprecedented change in their business. They\u2019re dealing with both price and volume pressure, and as a result, they\u2019re managing their spend very carefully and. And as we\u2019ve discussed, our business is not immune to the spending pressure, but just like in Watch, we\u2019re adapting to this changing market with innovation, strengthening our leadership position in measurement and analytics for the long term.","Last quarter, I talked about 3 efforts we\u2019re focused on as we manage through this challenging environment: first, productivity. It\u2019s evidenced by our financial results this quarter, enabling us to expand margins while continuing to invest in our key growth initiatives. We remain laser-focused.","Second is coverage. Here, we\u2019ve added and expanded our relationships with a number of key retailers, and we continue to make progress on our e-commerce measurement capabilities in the most important global markets.","And third, the Connected System, our top strategic priority. As a reminder, the Connected System is an open platform-based system that integrates Nielsen\u2019s data and other data sources and then seamlessly connects measurement and the everyday analytics our clients rely on to run their business. The system delivers 2 important client needs, speed and efficiency, helping them to answer what happened, why it happened and then, most importantly, what should I do next.","Last month, we officially unveiled the Connected System at our client conference in Los Angeles. The collected -- collective response from the hundreds of clients in attendance was overwhelmingly positive. Manufacturers and retailers of all sizes recognize the value they can unlock through the speed and efficiency gains delivered by the Connected System. It does it by keeping our clients\u2019 sales, marketing, finance and operations functions all aligned under key metrics, operating with one source of truth that\u2019s continuously updated and synchronized as they take action on their business. In my 20 years at Nielsen, I\u2019ve never seen a more positive response to a new Nielsen product.","As we said last quarter, the rollout of the Connected System will be similar to Total Audience Measurement, where some clients will want an end-to-end system right away while others will begin by using selected components. We\u2019re making progress in both fronts.","First, let\u2019s talk about the components. Our portfolio of apps within the Connected Partner Program has grown to 30 partners, with Periscope By McKinsey being the most recent addition. 17 of these partners had a demo booth at our recent client conference. We\u2019re also seeing strong demand for our in house everyday analytics apps. In total, we now have 106 clients using at least 1 component of the Connected System, up from 49 at the time of our last earnings call.","With regard to the end to end system, as I mentioned, the feedback we received at our client conference was overwhelmingly positive, and we\u2019re full speed ahead. We\u2019re targeting to roll out the Connected System to 100 clients by the end of 2018.","We\u2019ve spoken with you before about driving toward a stronger, higher margin business. The Connected System is a key part of this plan, but the vision we\u2019re building is much broader. It includes innovation throughout our business, including our operations and technology units. For example, we\u2019ll consolidate operation centers into super hubs to drive scale benefits. We\u2019ll take much greater advantage of automation and machine learning to drive big gains in speed, efficiency and quality. In emerging markets, where our measurement of retail sales remains a very manually intensive process, we\u2019ll aggressively digitize the data collection process, again producing big gains in speed, efficiency and quality.","These are big moves, designed to shrink our operational footprint, reduce manual processes and increase headcount productivity, all by big amounts. The net result will be a significant expansion in Buy margins by 2020. I\u2019m talking about a step change, a step change that leads to several percentage points. We\u2019re excited about how this plan is coming together, and we\u2019ll share more with you later this year.","Now as we execute on this plan, we\u2019ll be building on the fundamental strengths of our Buy business, and these are undeniable. They\u2019ll be a source of value and strength for long into the future. They include an incredibly high market share with the largest multinationals, supported by our unmatched global footprint. Our presence in 106 markets is more than 5x the next biggest player. That global footprint includes a strong leadership position in all of the faster growing emerging markets where our business enjoys a balance of strength with both local and global clients. And the intellectual property that underpins this business, our reference data, is unmatched. Reference data is valuable for several reasons. One is that it\u2019s the key to linking data from multiple sources, which means it\u2019s the key to unlocking value in a big data world.","In closing, we touched on several of our innovations and initiatives today, and at the forefront of those is our clients. Our mission is to measure our clients\u2019 performance and then help them improve performance. And today, that\u2019s as critical as ever. We\u2019re sharply focused on creating value for our clients, and as we do, we create greater value for our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Gubins","Thanks, Mitch. Dan, we\u2019re now ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","For developed Buy, what gives you the confidence in being able to forecast the business to be flat in 2018? And basically, it sounds like for \u201817, you\u2019re lowering the revenue guidance because Buy will continue to be challenging in the back half of the year. Are you seeing worsening trends in the business from here? Or is it just that the business will continue to be challenging for longer than you previously expected? And is basically the delta in terms of being flat next year the easier comps? Or is it the connected buy system being rolled out? Or what gives you the confidence that \u201818 will be flat?","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Toni. We\u2019re still working through our operating plan for 2018. However, as I said in my opening comments, our current revenue pipeline, which includes renewals and new business wins, suggests that developed Buy should be flat for 2018. I\u2019d point more to the back half of 2018 than the front half. We\u2019ll obviously share more details when we give the 2018 outlook later in the year. But from our clients\u2019 perspective, we know that our data and analytics are critical to help them understand their performance and business drivers. And while they\u2019ve had to make some tough cost tradeoffs, quite frankly, ultimately, they\u2019ll need to invest in those data and analytics to help them grow their business. And what we see, as we look into 2018, are a few dynamics. One is we\u2019re continuing to win with both retailers and manufacturers. We\u2019re renewing 100% of our long-term contracts with our large global manufacturers. Those contracts are staggered so even the ones that renewed with a lower base spending have price escalators through the contracts, and we\u2019re comping against a pretty tough 2017 environment. The last thing I\u2019ll add is that our Connected System has actually given us incremental capabilities to sell in during renewals, and this has a pretty positive impact on the value of those agreements.","On developed Buy, I\u2019d look at the first half for trending purposes, and in the first half, our U.S. business is down double digits. The back half comps get a little easier, but as I said, we\u2019re not forecasting a change in the environment. So the guidance framework that we gave of down 3% to 5% for developed Buy represents relatively easier comps in the U.S. in the back half and tougher comps in Western Europe, which, quite frankly, was up high single digits in the back half of 2016.","Mitch Barns","One thing I\u2019ll add, Toni, is in my conversations with a number of our client CEOs over the past couple of months, there\u2019s a growing recognition among our clients that the zero-based budgeting activities, the cost-cutting activities are going to get them only so far. And they\u2019re all now focused on, \"Hey, we got to get the top line moving,\" and they\u2019re working to figure that out. But as they do, and I\u2019m confident that they will, we expect some of that benefit also to flow into the results that we\u2019re going to see in our business in 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","I\u2019ll follow the rules and keep it to one. Maybe a fairly simple question. I\u2019d just love to hear a little more about what\u2019s going on in the core video\/text business at Watch. If you take out Gracenote, I think in Q1, your year-over-year growth rate was something like 6.1%. In Q2, it seemed to slow down a bit, like 4.7%, I think, for the press release. So I\u2019m just wondering, is there anything significant about that? Is that just some lumpiness? And even if that, could you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on there? And should we be paying attention to that? Or is that just noise?","Jamere Jackson","Thanks, Todd. It\u2019s in line with the framework. It grew roughly 5% in the first half ex Gracenote. So if you look at the trends for the first half, we\u2019re right on the framework. I\u2019d say a couple of things. One is national and digital are both solid in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Where there\u2019s been some pressure is local. But quite frankly, there, we\u2019re excited about the prospects that we have in local with the new initiatives that we\u2019re going to roll out, the expansion of electronic measurement in the diary markets, the integration of set-top box data and the panel expansion benefits to our clients. So, we feel good about the framework overall. And again, if you\u2019re looking at the first half, we\u2019re in line with that framework.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Jamere, I just want the organic constant-currency revenue growth for the overall company and the two divisions.","Jamere Jackson","As I mentioned in my opening comments, we had about 2 points of inorganic revenue in the quarter. Approximately 4 points were added from Gracenote and Repucom. That was offset by approximately 2 points from exits of segmentation and telecom and some of the research assets. In Watch, we had approximately 9 points added from Gracenote and Repucom, offset by approximately 1 point drag from the Other Watch assets exits and telecom. And in Buy, we had approximately 4 points of drag from the exit of the assets and segmentation in customer research. So that should give you the pieces of organic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Just on the Watch side again. I mean it sounds like you have a lot of good commentary in terms of updates and innovation and so forth, but I think the organic growth this quarter was up 3.5% on the Watch, I believe. So is that just timing, seasonality? Like what\u2019s the disconnect? And maybe if we look a little forward, like do you expect all these new products and innovation to help accelerate that growth? Or is it just to maintain your sort of contract status?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. You have a little bit of timing there, obviously. If I look at Marketing Effectiveness, for example, organically, we grew close to double digits in the first half. We\u2019re going to see strong demand and higher growth in the second half from our key products, and so we feel good about the 15% to 20% range for the year. If I look at Audience Measurement of Video and Text, as I said, it\u2019s in line with our framework if you look at roughly 5% in the first half. I feel good about national and digital. Local is where the pressure is, and we talked about the initiatives there. And then if I look at the corporate bucket, we have a few things rolling through there. One is we actually sunset the digital rankings product in the quarter. We have also exited some assets in content testing. So overall, I feel good about the guidance framework. Let me just sort of walk through that, just to give you the pieces. So if I look at -- let me just start with Buy. If I look at our Buy business, we\u2019re going to be down roughly 2.5% to 3% on a constant-currency basis for the year. That suggests that developed is down minus 3% to minus 5%; emerging, plus 8% to 10%; and then, corporate bucket is down 60%. And if I moved to Watch, no change to the framework there, up 11% to 13% in total for Watch. We see audio as being flat; Audience Measurement of Video and Text, up 14% to 16%; Marketing Effectiveness, up 15% to 20%; and then the Other Watch bucket, down 10%. So that gives you the framework that we have for the total company. Again, you always have a little bit of timing and lumpiness quarter-over-quarter, but we feel pretty good about the framework that we have from a guidance standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Anj Singh","I just wanted to get some more thoughts on the back half assumptions for developed Buy. It seems like despite the easier comps that you have for the back half of \u201817, the growth outlook is worse than what 2Q had, so perhaps some thoughts on what changed during the quarter for you to provide guidance lower. Was it more on the transactional discretionary parts of the business? Or is it just broad-based pressure in general? Any thoughts there?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So if I look at developed Buy, let me take it in a couple of pieces. I\u2019ll talk about the U.S., and then I\u2019ll talk about Europe. I look at the first half, again for trending purposes, in the first half, the U.S. business was down double digits. The comps do get a little easier in the back half of the year, but we\u2019re not forecasting a change in the environment. So that guidance framework of being down 3% to 5% actually represents slightly easier comps in the U.S. in the back half. But the comps actually for Western Europe are a tough -- are a little bit tougher because in the back half of 2016, Western Europe was up mid-single digits. And what I\u2019ll say about Western Europe is that we continue to be pleased with the recovery that we see in Western Europe that, again, began in the back half of 2016. So while the second half comps are a little tougher, I would say that the environment there is as good as it\u2019s been in 3 or 4 years in those markets. So again, that framework that we suggest says U.S. is a little bit better against a different set of comps, and Western Europe has a tougher set of comps in the back half of the year and net-net, you\u2019re about where you are in the first half of the year for our Buy business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. ","Brian Wieser","I\u2019m curious how you think your Buy-related products are doing in terms of market share versus competitors. Are there some subproduct categories where you think you\u2019re up versus others where you\u2019re down? Or are the trends that you\u2019ve been talking about really broad-based?","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Brian. Good to hear your voice. The trends are pretty constant, I would say. The -- what you see rolling through our business is more a reflection of the marketplace environment than it is anything to do with market share. Probably one positive thing to point to, though, with regard to market share is what we\u2019re starting to see flow through our Connected System, in particular the apps from the Connected Partners. What I mean is we\u2019re starting to see these 106 clients who are now using some component of the Connected System, one of these apps, we\u2019re seeing a lot of this being new business to us. In other words, clients are using these apps in cases where they weren\u2019t buying our analytics products before. Part of it is the -- sort of the price point and the value but also the speed and the usefulness that these apps bring to their business. So that\u2019s probably an area where I\u2019d point to some gains in market share, but that\u2019s not really at the center of the business and the biggest part of the revenue. The bigger issue that we\u2019re battling against in the developed Buy markets right now really is the environment more than it is the competitive environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Kip Paulson with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. ","Kip Paulson","For the Watch business, can you expand on the new datasets you\u2019ve added, which the release mentions? And how is Nielsen positioned with mobile panel specifically in terms of geographies, panel sizes, et cetera?","Mitch Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question. New datasets, a couple of examples here, some of which are already a part of the products that we\u2019re rolling out and some are more part of the future. Set-top box data is the best example on the Watch side of the business. We\u2019ve used it for our analytics products historically, and now what we\u2019re doing is expanding the role that it plays in our business by bringing the set-top box data into our audience measurement products. And importantly, we\u2019re doing this not by getting rid of our panels. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re combining our panels, which still have incredible strengths, unique strengths in the marketplace. We\u2019re combining those with the set top box data, putting those two datasets together and leveraging the strengths of each of them to do -- to provide a measurement product that will be better than anybody else can provide. So that\u2019s the best use of it there. ","The second area where we\u2019re drawing in new datasets is as you look at our Gracenote business. As we mentioned, they have their automatic content recognition technology, and that enables them to do a lot of powerful things for the client base that they work on. But it also opens up smart TV data for our business, which we\u2019ve always known is out there but we haven\u2019t really had an efficient way to tap into. So that\u2019s another new dataset that will really be powerful for our Watch business, both from a video audience measurement perspective. We also see opportunity there with respect to audio. So those are two examples. With respect to mobile panels in different parts of the world, what we\u2019re really focused on, as far as digital measurement as we expand our footprint around the world, is rolling out the Digital Ad Ratings metric. ","And while that has a panel component, it is not a panel reliant measurement approach. It leverages big data, and then it, in many markets, leverages a small panel that\u2019s used for projection and calibration because big data always has skews and issues that need to be corrected. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on in terms of the use of panels in many of these markets, but it\u2019s much more of a big data approach, led by our Digital Ad Ratings metric and then typically followed by Digital Content Ratings and a more full version of our Total Audience Measurement system as we expand to additional markets around the world. And if I have the number right, Digital Ad Ratings is now in around 25 markets around the world, and those markets account for about 85% or -- 85% of global digital advertising spend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Salmon","Maybe, Jamere, could we return to the viewpoint, early guidance, whatever we want to call it, about more of a flat view for Buy in 2018? And just add a little bit of color around the components of that. What I\u2019m trying to get at is, how much discretionary spend are you thinking in that number? And it\u2019s a question not just about mix but also how the business is evolving as you move to the Connected System and just understand what underlies that view a bit more.","Jamere Jackson","Sure. So I\u2019ll hit a couple of things, and I\u2019ll ask Mitch to chime in on the remaining pieces of it. As I said, there are really three things, Dan, that sort of drive our outlook. One is what we are seeing in terms of wins with both retailers and manufacturers in this environment that we\u2019re operating in. That\u2019s been pretty important for us to continue to go after new business, and our teams are doing a pretty good job from a business development standpoint based on what we see in our early read. ","The second thing I would say is that we\u2019re continuing to renew all of our long term contracts with our global manufacturers. And while we\u2019ve had some of those contracts that renewed at a lower base, obviously, those contracts are staggered, and even the ones that renewed at a lower base have price escalators that move through the contracts as you go forward. And then the third piece, as I said, is sort of comping against a tough 2017 environment. We expect to see some improvement there based on our most recent discussions with our clients. ","And as I think about sort of the impact of the Connected System, I would say two things. One is that we do expect some revenue from the Connected System, some of which will be incremental, specifically revenue from the Connected Partner Program. But really, the second dimension is the one where we see the Connected System is actually giving us incremental things for our commercial teams to go sell and do renewals, and that\u2019s actually given us a positive impact on some of those agreements. Our primary focus next year is going to be on conversions. And we expect that to ramp through the back half of the year, but the incremental revenue and the promise that we see from the Connected Partner Program is actually a positive as we look into 2018.","Mitch Barns","Yes. I just want to emphasize the point Jamere made about Connected System being part of the story that our commercial teams are talking about with our clients even right now as we\u2019re renewing current contract renewals that\u2019ll, of course, begin to roll through our financials next year. The fact is it is part of the story and that clients are responding in such an overwhelmingly positive manner to it. That\u2019s already having a positive impact in our business even separate from the fact the issue of whether or not a client will engage with Connected System immediately in 2018 on an end-to-end basis or not. It\u2019s more about how they view the idea of signing up for a multiyear contract with Nielsen being their partner and then having an understanding of what\u2019s in our product pipeline. And when they see what\u2019s in our product pipeline, they like it, and so that\u2019s already been helping us as we approach these contract renewals and new client wins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington","So I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the Buy developed side. Last quarter, you\u2019d mentioned that the non-U.S. developed grew low single digits and the U.S., was down mid-teens. There was improvement sequentially. I just wanted to ask if we could get the growth rates for each of those pieces. I know, Jamere, you mentioned double digits, but I\u2019m looking for a little more granularity there.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So if I look at the U.S. business down mid-teens in the first quarter, second quarter, it was down again high singles, and then we saw sort of mid-singles across the rest of the developed world. So those are sort of the pieces that are there. And again, environment is still tough in the U.S., and we feel pretty good about the recovery that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in Western Europe, that really began in the back half of last year. And I can\u2019t reiterate enough how pleased we are with that recovery and the fact, that, that environment is as good as it\u2019s been in the last three or four years.","Mitch Barns","One thing our teams in Western Europe have done well over the past couple of years in particular is their focus on retailers. Some of our wins in Europe have been with important retailers. We\u2019ve taken that playbook, brought it to the U.S., even brought people from our European business to our U.S. business and we\u2019re starting to run that play now, too, and we\u2019re going to make progress on that front. And that\u2019s really important given the role that retailers are playing in the overall fast-moving consumer goods ecosystem these days, which only grows in importance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Matthew Thornton","Just to clarify, for the \u201817 guidance on the core organic constant-currency growth, I think the only delta from prior guidance to current guidance is developed Buy. So I want to make sure that\u2019s correct, number one. On Gracenote, it looks like, if I did the math right, it looks like the implied number is actually down a little bit. Just maybe if you could provide any color around that. And then just finally, a lot of announcements and momentum around digital. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any way to tease apart or if you\u2019d be willing to provide what digital-first clients are these days as a percentage of Watch revenue. Any color there would be great.","Jamere Jackson","Yes, just, so from a guidance standpoint, you\u2019re right, the key pressure from a core standpoint is actually in developed, where we\u2019re now guiding being down minus 3% to minus 5%. That is the key driver to what you see in the core revenue number coming down. From a Gracenote standpoint, no change in terms of our expectations there. The business is off to a great start. The integration is on track. The teams are excited about some of the commercial opportunities that Mitch mentioned. So no change to our Gracenote outlook there. The business is off to a really good start.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","I wonder -- can you give us a sense, the margins in the developed Buy -- or is the Western European business similar to the U.S.? Or how do we think about the margin profile just as we model out the back half of the year?","Jamere Jackson","I would say the margin profile is similar. But what I would say on Buy, as you\u2019re thinking about margin profile, is really more around our cost actions, and the cost actions that we took there were really aimed at rightsizing our business for the current market realities. We took restructuring charges over the past three quarters to fund these actions. These actions were in addition to our normal productivity plays, and they\u2019re helping us mute the impact of a softer revenue environment. And quite frankly, the other thing is none of these actions impact our ability to invest in our key initiatives. So as you\u2019re thinking about margin profile, just know that we\u2019ve got a number of cost actions that began in the back half of last year that are going to roll all the way through 2017, and that is the reason why we raised the EBITDA margin guidance and the big contributor to us maintaining our EPS guidance for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Tom Eagan","I was looking for your comments on the local TV station customers. Sinclair indicated their intention to move exclusively over the comScore. So I guess, how have those conversations gone? And also, what are the other TV station groups saying? And what contracts are renewed in 2018?","Mitch Barns","Yes, on your question though, look, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not going to comment on a topic that is part of an active contract negotiation with an important client. But here\u2019s what I can say. I can say that the improvements that we\u2019re making in our local audience measurement product are being very well received by our client base. As a reminder, we are bringing electronic measurement now to all of the local markets as opposed to just the first 70 where it is right now. We\u2019re incorporating set-top box data for more granularity and stability in the ratings. We\u2019re bringing new analytics offerings which help people advertise with more precision, drive more value for that advertising inventory. And yes, across our client base, these moves are resonating very well, and you see it reflected in the contract renewals we\u2019ve had already this year with CBS local, with Fox local, with Entravision. One thing I will say about Sinclair, we just recently expanded our relationship with the Tennis Channel, and the Tennis Channel is owned by Sinclair.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Doug Arthur","Jamere, just on -- you talked quite a bit about the strength in Western Europe in the Buy developed markets. Can you just sort of update us on what percent of developed market revenues Western Europe represents right now?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. Western Europe is probably 35% to 40% of the developed market business.","Doug Arthur","So U.S. is still 50ish?","Jamere Jackson","Yes, just a little bit under 50% this quarter.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mitch Barns for closing remarks.","Mitch Barns","Thank you. Yes, just a few closing comments to sum up. In Watch, we\u2019re seeing solid growth with Audience Measurement of Video and Text. And as we\u2019ve highlighted, we see multiple areas of opportunity across our business, and we\u2019re going to continue to respond to the changes in the market with innovation in order to capture that growth.","Our Buy emerging business continues to show strength, up 10% in the quarter. Our Buy developed business, we\u2019re focused on productivity, and we\u2019re continuing to expand coverage, especially with the value retailers, the specialty outlets. And of course, we\u2019ll stay focused on continuing to develop our e-commerce measurement capabilities. Most important priority for us though in our Buy developed business is the execution on our development of the Connected System, and that includes our in-house apps and the Connected Partner Program.","All of these things that we\u2019re doing in our business are all anchored to the objective of driving value, value for our clients and value for our shareholders.","And so with that, let me just say thank you once again for joining us on the call this morning, and we look forward to talking with many of you more -- many more of you in the days and weeks ahead.","Operator","Thank you, everyone, for attending today.

With that, I will turn it over to our CEO, David Calhoun.","David L. Calhoun","Thank you, Liz, and good morning. We had a very solid first quarter as we entered the year.","Our revenue was up 4% on a constant currency basis, 3% on a reported basis. We had very strong growth in recurring revenue, which is the long term, more subscription-oriented business that we enjoy.","Still pressure on our Insight business. As you look around the world, we see a slow growth environment, but a stable environment, with one exception and that's Europe, which enters its third year of basically moving sideways. But all in all, a solid, solid quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA grew 5% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. We had a very healthy margin expansion embedded in that. And adjusted net income grew 26% on a reported basis and 29% on a constant currency basis.","There has been no change in our outlooks and our investments in growth opportunities, so we remain fully invested and, with our natural margin expansion, we have the ability to continue on that course.","We had very strong free cash flow in the first quarter, $70 million better than a year ago, and that supports the capital policy adjustment we made as we entered the year. And so we feel very good about continuing along those lines.","Arbitron shareholders approved a transaction roughly a month ago, and a regulatory process with respect to Arbitron is ongoing. We're responding to the second request. I've had very constructive and favorable feedback from the radio market, so I feel good about how that process continues. And then finally, we will reaffirm our 2013 guidance.","The next, Page 6, is just a few of the significant growth opportunities that we have. We talk frequently about our program reach and read, which is to continue to build coverage across all of Africa, rural China, rural India. That program continues and we continue to capture more and more consumers in that process.","We are doing a very good job of activating our Buy data. We have a couple of products we don't talk frequently about, Global Track being one, which is the ability to, in essence, track market shares all around the world for some of our big multi-nationals, and we recently signed another big client to that product.","We have a Total Store Read. When we acquired the Perishables Group, we now have ability to really measure all of what a store is capturing by way of market share and many of our clients, including Safeway, have done a terrific job with that. And then finally, Nielsen Catalina, which is a long-term investment that we made, which marries some of our Watch and Buy data, is off to a really good start here as we enter the year.","We continue to build on a business that we refer to as Ad Solutions, which is, in effect, the marriage of Watch and Buy data, and it measures brand effect for television and now with the Vizu acquisition, online and digital. And we have a new product, Nielsen Buyer Insights, which is the marriage of credit card data with all of our Watch data. At any rate, this package of products and the Ad Solutions approach to the marketplace has done exceedingly well and continues to grow at a healthy double-digit pace.","We've increased the reach of the OCR and XCR platforms, again, to bridge the digital world. We've had great success on this front. We continue to sign up more campaigns. We now have more than 200 advertisers and agencies, and we recently signed up the Omnicom Media Group, and so we feel very good. International expansion includes Australia, Canada, Germany and Italy, so we continue to stay on a very good course with respect to OCR.","Social television ratings is a product, as you know, we created a relationship with Twitter that will be introduced here as we enter the fourth quarter of the year. Importantly, the SocialGuide product that we acquired, again, and uses the Twitter feed, is off to a really good start. And we've got a lot of interest across all the media companies and ad agencies. And at least based on the first couple of months, I feel real good about the prospect of that product and the interest.","And then finally, we continue to capture more audiences across more devices. That course is always our objective. First, to measure; second, to roll them into our commercial ratings, and that's a process we'll stay on forever. But we continue to make great progress.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. He'll fire through the financials, and then we'll get to Q&A. Thank you.","Brian J. West","Thanks, David. Good morning. First quarter revenue was $1.37 billion, up 4% constant currency, as Dave mentioned.","Adjusted EBITDA was $349 million. That's up 6% constant currency, and margins expanded 42 basis points to 25.4%.","We did see the impact of foreign exchange in the quarter. FX rates were a drag of 90 basis points on revenue and around 100-basis-point drag on EBITDA.","Adjusted net income was $145 million, up 29%, a strong result driven by, first, our continued deleveraging; second, the refinancing of our term loan and the associated benefit from lower interest costs; and three, our ongoing long-term favorable tax attributes. All that rolled into, as I said, a nice earnings growth quarter.","Adjusted income per share came in at $0.38. And finally, our free cash flow was a usage of $60 million. And as Dave pointed out, that's an improvement of $69 million versus the same time last year, reflective of the underlying business performance.","So I move on to Page 9, segment revenue. First quarter was yet another quarter of consecutive top line growth. Total Buy revenue was $825 million. That's up 5% constant currency. Information services was $648 million, up 7%, and that's driven by growth in both North America and the developing markets, reflective of where we invest. The smaller part of Buy Insights was $177 million. It's down 4% year-over-year, which is a better sequential growth trend versus the fourth quarter of last year. And developing markets was up 6%. On one hand, the global multi-national clients are still cautious. But on the other hand, we saw a continued strength from local and regional clients.","Total Watch revenue was $494 million. It's up a nice 4%. Another consistent performance from TV measurement, and a double-digit growth, as Dave mentioned, from our Ad Solutions business.","A side note, we made a small adjustment related to one of our legacy online businesses to discontinued operations. There's a page of the Appendix to help you update your models.","Moving on to Expositions. Revenue was $57 million. That's a decrease of 7%. It's all due to trade show timing between quarters. You'll see this flip around in 2Q when we expect to see the Expo segment grow double digits. So core revenue, if you take out Expositions, was up 4.5% constant currency. As Dave mentioned, a nice one for us. Very steady.","Page 10, profitability. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $349 million, up 6% constant currency and, again, 42 basis points of expansion. Buy EBITDA was $124 million, up 5% as we continue to fund growth investments. Watch EBITDA came in at $199 million, up 7%, with very nice continued margin expansion, reflective of the scalability of the business model. Expositions EBITDA was $32 million, down 11%, again, all due to show timing and we expect strong double-digit EBITDA growth in Expositions in the second quarter. Overall, we're delivering on our cost management, productivity efforts, while funding the growth investments and expanding margins.","Turning to Page 11. We do see the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange rates because -- in our reported results, that is, as almost half of our revenues were outside the U.S. The bar graph depicts both historical and projected foreign exchange impact on our revenue. In 1Q, you see the drag of 90 bps. And if all rates stay the same, constant, for the remainder of the year, second quarter revenue will have a small drag of around 10 basis points on revenue, and then the full year will see a drag of 40 basis points, both on revenue and on EBITDA. I remind everybody, this is just a trends translation effect as we report. We always talk about constant currency, which reflects the underlying operating performance of the business.","Moving on to Page 12. Upper left, free cash flow in the quarter, usage $60 million. As I mentioned, almost $70 million better than last year, driven by the operating performance and lower interest costs. CapEx came in at $70 million. Cash taxes $29 million, that low rate driven by the long-term attributes that we enjoy. And restructuring came in at $21 million.","On the balance sheet, bottom left of the chart, net debt came in at just over $6 billion, and the net debt ratio was 3.76x.","On the cap table on the right, we refinanced $3 billion in the quarter and lowered our rate by around 56 basis points. And it really took our -- it's the driver that took our weighted average interest rate to just under 4.5%. And as you can see from the table, we still have high -- higher coupon notes in the cap structure that we view as an opportunity going forward.","Moving on to Page 13, 2013 guidance. As Dave mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. Revenue growth at 4.0% to 5.0% constant currency growth. Adjusted margin expansion in the 40 to 60 basis point range. The adjusted net income growth versus the last February earnings call has been updated to plus 15% to 19% constant currency, which just reflects the benefit of the refinancing and the lower interest expense.","Our reported adjusted income per share is at $2.13 to $2.19. We'll leave that where it's at and reaffirm there. And everything else, we haven't changed, other than a very slight tweak to the share count number.","So with that, I will turn it over to Liz, and we can start Q&A. Thank you.","Liz Zale","Operator, go ahead. We'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you give us some more details on what you're seeing in Europe, particular markets and how that might vary between Information and Insights?","Brian J. West","Yes, Sarah. Europe has been and continues to be a pretty big drag on our company. As you know, for almost 3 straight years, it's basically been going sideways. The reason it goes sideways is because the Information business holds up very well, which it has. And the Insight business, which declined significantly in the first 18 months, it gets smaller and smaller. I don't see that changing. The only thing that probably gives us some concern as we look for the rest of the year is just the extent to which it influences Eastern Europe, which we always have viewed as a developing market. So to be honest with you, I do think the Europe situation doesn't get any better. I think we're going to have to sort of stay in the status quo, as the way -- as how we think about it for at least another year or 2, and then get on with business in the other markets around the world. But it's been a tough situation and I think it's going to stay a tough situation as far as I can see.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second, in the Insights business, it does seem like the revenue declines may have bottomed. So first, I want to just check and see if you think that that's fair. And then second, where are you seeing the improvement or easing of pressure? And are there any signs that your global clients might be thinking about ramping their spend later in the year?","Brian J. West","Sarah, there's no doubt we saw bottom as we exited 2012, where the back half of that year was in the down 8%, 9% range. And we saw that getting better as we turned the corner in 2013. I'd also remind you, as you probably know, there is a comp phenomenon here. So the first quarter of last year was the highest single quarter for Insights growth in probably 2 years. It grew 7%. So I'm up against that a little bit. But from our view is, if everything stays basically the way it is in that part of our business as you go through 2013, it's got to get better because comps get better, and it'll start to grow just because of the math. So our -- what we're seeing out there relative to some of the client behavior is that the developing markets look like they're getting a little bit more investment on a relative basis, and that feels pretty good. And then client-by-client, it can be different. But the global clients still, there's no doubt, are feeling pretty cautious in general.","David L. Calhoun","Yes. I -- to even get more specific question about the end of that question, I don't see any breakout opportunities to the upside, just by way of attitude, with all the multi-nationals. If we're going to continue to feel really good growth with the local clients and all the developing markets, I think that's going to be a -- continue to be great. But I don't see any big upside sort of popping with the multi-nationals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask about the all outlets combined database, so the so-called Walmart database when we think about the full year guidance of 4% to 5% constant currency. As we go into the second half of the year, is there going to be a comps challenge year-over-year because -- as we anniversary the AOC data? And then the second part of the question is, is the AOC data driving any additional Buy Insights business kind of more specific, not a cyclical rebound, but Buy Insights benefiting from the value of AOC data and desire to do more analytics around it?","David L. Calhoun","So there's going to be mix shifts that occur over the course of the year that, I think, we're pretty comfortable with how they're all going to play out, which allows us to feel good and reaffirm the guidance that we've given you for the year. Yes, there is a -- there is definitely an adjustment that occurs with respect to the inclusion of Walmart for the 12 months up through about the end of the second quarter. But we -- what's going on in the Insights business and the comps that sort of play out over the course of the year sort of more than offset that. So -- and we've got another factor, which is sort of some share shift gains that we have had over the course of the year. We don't report individual wins and losses, but we can account for them pretty clearly when they come and how they come. And so I feel real good about reaffirming that guidance. And yes, you're going to see some shifts in the mix of our business due to the Walmart phenomena. We are, no doubt, seeing more analytics based on Walmart and the Total Store Read stuff that we have. There's no doubt about that. But some of that offsets other Insight work that we do. And as I've said on this call many times and probably frustrate everyone, we don't know exactly what that offset is, so we're trying to just account for the aggregate Insight business and order rates. We feel good about where they are today. We don't need a big upside to happen in Insights for us to have favorable comps as we run through the rest of the year, and that's really the basis for our guidance. Brian, do you want to add anything to that?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the Watch division, there's been a mismatch or, let's say, an outperformance within the segment, where your TV revs are outperforming the overall segment. And it looks like there's also pretty good performance from your Ad Solutions business. So maybe if you can comment on the part of the business there that's weighing it down. It sounds like you did get rid of some of your legacy online business. And is there a point later in the year where the segment starts to look more like what the TV business is currently doing?","Brian J. West","Yes. It may hit exactly. You still have -- while we took care of one relatively small -- actually, a very small part of the legacy online portfolio in the disc ops, there's still online legacy stuff that's running off, and we've been pretty clear about that we were just going to manage that down, and you'll see that. And to your point, I think, as you start to get later in the year, you'll start to see our digital business, our Ad Solutions business, our TV business, they will all start to move generally in a more consistent direction. But we're still at the tail end of running off some of this old legacy online stuff.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you be a little bit more specific? What is the online piece that is running off and why? And also, can you comment a little bit on any initiatives you're making within local? I think I read out there that you're expanding your hybrid local measurement. What can we expect going forward?","Brian J. West","Well, remember part of that legacy online was old, real planning tools that really were antiquated and probably were relevant 10 years ago to how you measure the Web that really aren't today. And those are still hanging around, albeit much smaller. And that's the stuff that you'll start to -- you continue to wind down. You want to fulfill some responsibility to clients, but then, you're going to get out of it. And that's the piece that I'm talking about. The local side feels very good in our view, particularly around how we launch local hybrid.","David L. Calhoun","Now you'll recall that OCR was designed to displace the planning tool that previously was used as the audience reach measurement tool. OCR becomes the reach measurement tool, and it really obsoleted that planning tool for us. And we have been basically allowing that to sort of drift down. It's not a big number anymore. And as I said -- as Brian said, I think by the time we get to the second half of this year, it becomes pretty much de minimis.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there a point at which you can slow down investment in there and shut down some legacy systems and, actually, besides the revenue loss get some profitability benefit from it?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, but I wouldn't overstate that one. The truth is, I mean, with respect to just the online piece, we have much bigger benefits to harvest in closing down old legacy systems in a bigger, broader, Buy side of our business. So the answer to your question is yes, that's an ongoing productivity opportunity for us. It's part of why our margins continue to expand. I wouldn't attribute that all to just that online legacy piece. That's not going to be the biggest part of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just give us a little more detail on the regulatory process with Arbitron? Just remind us where you are. And can you address any specific issues that the FTC is focused on? And any sense of when this would potentially close?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, all I can do, Suzi, I'll tell you where we are. I'm not going to try to speculate outcomes because it's a regulator and that's not smart on my part. We are literally trying to complete the second request, which is the documentation that is required inside the company. We have to organize it. We have to sort of prepare summaries and then we have to hand it over. So we are really at the tail end of that process, almost ready to give it all to them. They will then go through their reviews and questions. And so we're not -- I don't want to speculate as to exactly where we zero in. I would suggest that, as I said early on, the request itself doesn't surprise us, doesn't concern us. We're just going to do our best, respond. There's nothing about the documentation that we've organized and prepared that scares us. So we're just going to move down this way, but I can't really speculate for you what outcomes are going to be. I'm going to guess it's somewhere between 60 days and 4 months it will take for them to just go through it and give us a response. So anyway, I'd like to be more specific, but I can't. They are a regulator.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And how are you thinking about the acquisition pipeline now? Is this sidelining you waiting for Arbitron?","David L. Calhoun","No, no, no. We look at them all day long, we continue to look at them all day long. We have a pretty rich pipeline. We'll continue down that path. As I've said many times, our appetite is usually built around smaller tuck-in acquisitions that complement our product portfolio, like the ones we've been doing, Vizu, SocialGuide, Perishables, that kind of stuff. It's a rich and it's a deep pipeline, and we'll continue to add things.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Boyer from Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to make sure the assumptions around the Arbitron increasing are still the same.","Brian J. West","Yes, no change. As what we've talked about in December, I think that's $0.13 EPS in the first 12 months and then 19% in the following 12 months.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then you had mentioned the credit Insights acquisition. On the merger, are you seeing more competition from companies that capture retail purchase data from credit and debit data?","David L. Calhoun","No. Again, this wasn't an acquisition. This was a data deal. So we got what we think is worth the best source of credit card data. We married it with our Watch data, and we're out in the marketplace with it. And it's a very, very good product. The truth is, we don't see a lot of competition on that front, mostly because the difficulty is they don't have the Watch data to marry it to. So for us, that's a relatively easy thing to do. I also believe we have the single biggest source of credit card data built into our product. So I feel good about that, and I don't see a significant competition today, and I don't see one likely in the next 12 to 24 months.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then we haven't talked about Answers in quite a long time. I'm just wondering what the status is there.","David L. Calhoun","Yes, we're very happy with Answers. As you know, the big-launch clients, 2 manufacturers, Proctor and Kraft, and the big retailer, Safeway, with their loyalty program. So all 3 are performing really, really well. All 3 are adding the functionality. Our job now is to convert a couple every year, and we'll do that.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Are we at the point where we could see some cost savings from that platform, the migration off of the legacy platforms in 2014?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, you'll see that. I mean, that's part of our -- definitely part of our long-term productivity opportunity. First, build the platform, make sure it's robust, make sure it can handle the global marketplace and then steadily, steadily convert our clients. And that is what we will do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Could you please give a comment -- another comment on the OCR and XCR business which seems to have a lot of potential? You did refer to some great success and a lot of advertisers and agencies signed up. What more can you tell us, please, about where the business stands now and what the growth opportunity may be?","David L. Calhoun","Well, we're as bullish as we've ever been. We are not yet a standard in the industry. I think we are becoming one in the video advertising space, which is the rich part of the space, and the space that, in our view, was the most important one to capture. So I feel very good about that. We're winning most of what we see, not all of what we see. And our job is to eventually turn this into a standard. So I don't know what to tell you other than we're adding more advertisers, we're adding more agencies. I think the inclusion of the Omnicom Media Group is another important sign because it's going to be the agencies in the end who, as they make these conversions and learn how to make money themselves from this product, that's what's really going to accelerate its use. And so again, very steady progress. We're not going to call out the numbers until we really get to significant critical mass and we can begin to talk about it as a standard. But we feel good about it. And that's pretty much all I can tell you at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bird from Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","How would you characterize developing markets' conditions and potential for improvement? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could drill down a little bit more on how you see the commercial opportunity from both Twitter ratings and Nielsen Buyer Insights.","David L. Calhoun","I feel better about the developing markets than I did a year ago. There is some stability. I think they all are planning on slightly slower growth objectives as economies, and that's actually a healthy thing. We are going to be the beneficiary. We already are with the conversion to a consumer economy in China. So as I think everyone knows, looking at just the GDP numbers is not -- it's not something that really influences us. There is the significant economic objective to move to a more consumer-oriented economy in China. That's a good thing. We get a lot of support from the government to help them with policy development and building consumer confidence, so that feels right. I think we're going to have a really good run in India. We've had some terrific wins. They're in the order book, and I feel good about how they're going to play out over the course of the year. Latin America, probably the toughest of the developing world, but not bad. I mean, it's going to be, I think, a good middle-single digit kind of game for us. So I feel good about all of it. Eastern Europe probably isn't going to feel as robust as it has historically for us simply because the effects of Europe are creeping into it. And I think Russia's the one other country that's difficult. But all in all, better than I did a year ago, for sure. The Twitter product, I will tell you, again, it's small today. I'm way excited about it because I'm getting calls from everybody. The folks running the business for me are just pleading for more salespeople. So I -- all the signals are really good. That's the SocialGuide product, which delivers audience information to advertisers, mostly for their own sell side activities. When we get to real ratings that sit alongside our program ratings as we approach the fall, that's when the business really starts to play bigger. And that's -- that moment is going to come, and I feel good about the prospects for it. So we'll call out numbers when they become meaningful enough to influence all of our financials. But right now, all I can tell you is it feels really, really good about the early momentum.","Liz Zale","[indiscernible]","Brian J. West","NBI.","David L. Calhoun","Oh, I'm sorry. NBI. Same thing. We've had a great uptake. It covers more than the CPG world. When we go out to the CPG world, we need sort of product levels, SKU level kinds of data to really -- to help. This is retail establishment level data that you get from credit cards. It doesn't boil all the way down to SKU data. So it really -- for the travel and leisure industries and the industries that are most interested in attracting consumers to their particular retail outlet, that is where this one plays big. And so we're beginning to enter new markets that we didn't enter before. It's actually very exciting. So anyway, I -- again, off to a good, early, fast start. Part of our advertising solutions' success, and we're almost at critical mass there, where we can start really talking about it. But anyway, it's growing quickly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur from Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Dave, you -- the Nielsen Catalina partnership has been around for a bit, but you seem to have particularly clawed out this quarter. Is anything, I mean, dramatically changing there? You mentioned as part of your -- an overall solution offering [indiscernible] amplify.","David L. Calhoun","We have a product we refer to as Brand Dashboard [ph], which, in effect, allows for brand managers who are looking for very specific consumers and very specific consumer behavioral attributes, to, in effect, dial in specific programs that they should be advertising on. So it just is a -- it's a much more precise way of placing advertising in the end. That is what the product's being used for. That was the original design of this joint venture, but believe it or not, we've literally just gotten to the launch. So, again, it feels good. It's part of a nice portfolio, and it's growing very quickly. So yes, you're right, the rubber's finally hit the road on that one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","One thing I was noticing from your K recently, actually, was that if you look at the top 5 Watch clients, which I guess are the broadcast networks, primarily, you've got -- you have about 15% year-over-year growth. But everyone else, by inference, was basically flat. I was wondering if you could characterize any diverging trends between the different Watch clients. I assume that the rest is sort of the agencies and smaller networks. A second question around...","David L. Calhoun","Hey, can I just address that quickly? Because I think maybe you ought to just take that offline and talk directly to Liz. I don't recognize that data at all.","Liz Zale","Yes. I wouldn't agree with that characterization at all.","David L. Calhoun","So I don't want anybody to get the wrong impression on us.","Liz Zale","Business grows across the breadth of the business.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. So separately, on Online Campaign Ratings, it sounds like certainly a lot of traction among agencies. But when we -- we heard that Google, for example, has not adopted or embraced it. I'm curious to, maybe just speaking more generally, among those publishers which have not signed up, do you get a sense that it's mostly just a commercial discussion versus a strategic one? In other words, there may be some players who want to create a competing currency or just won't sign up under any terms? Or is it just a question of eventually coming to commercial terms? Curious for any thoughts you have on that.","David L. Calhoun","Well, with Google, as you mentioned, which is the one that matters the most, I think, for the broad marketplace, it's purely a strategic question for them. So they have, as you know, announced better part of a year ago, their own product to, in effect, measure their sites. And I don't -- our view is that the market will always need and require an objective measurement to satisfy itself in the placement of advertising. And the advertisers who we started with as we designed this product have pretty much proved that point as they've gone down the path with us and with independent measurement. So -- but Google is going to have to wrestle with that decision. And listen, they are -- they have a one guy who's big enough -- who's got a big enough reach to draw their own conclusions. We believe it's in their best interest and the market's best interest to have the objective measure, and we think they'll be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that measure. But listen, he's saying it. They have to commit themselves to that. I'm hopeful that someday that'll happen.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","We've definitely heard they left money on the table by not having it.","David L. Calhoun","Well, this happens. This happens. There are always folks who -- they have a reach in data who want to measure themselves. And I get it, and I understand it. They've got great insights to it. But the independent measurement thing is a very important thing for the -- ultimately to get the maximum realization of that market. I think and believe that someday, they'll come to that conclusion.","Operator","And our final question for this morning comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just -- you mentioned the Twitter business is still small. But the other day, we saw an announcement from that company and Publicis about a tighter integration between the 2. I expect we may see more of those coming. Should we view these type of announcements as sort of second derivative positives for your work with Twitter as those companies tighten up with the agencies a bit more?","David L. Calhoun","I think that's the perfect description, to be honest with you. Yes. They're very complementary. What's happening is you're going to see a real shift in measurement from purely measuring paid advertising reach to paid and earned. Earned, really, is the Twitter and Facebook feed, right? That's what that is. And because you don't pay for the reach, but you get it as a result of either good programming or good content or just a great message. So that is what we're all leaning into. Our measurement facilitates that currency, if you will, and then everything else just becomes sort of a big ad for the agencies to go out and help their clients sell better, get their messages clear, learn how to leverage the earned component of reach. That is really -- I think your characterization as a second derivative is a perfect description.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the conference call back over to Ms. Zale for any closing remarks.","Liz Zale","Thank you.

In the quarter we continue to execute on our strategy to provide uniquely better measurement and analytics products to drive growth and efficiency for our clients and for Nielsen. We made significant progress even while facing rapidly changing environments in both Watch and Buy. For more than 90 years we\u2019ve leveraged changes and means for progress by innovating the services we provide and adapting to the changing environments in which we operate. This is both our legacy and our future. Our ongoing commitment to innovation will drive growth and efficiency in the years to come.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jamere to review the financials and then I\u2019ll come back to provide an update on some of our key initiatives and a look into our future. Jamere.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. Once again our results reflect revenue growth and margin expansion in the challenging environment. In our Buy segment revenue remains soft as a result of the challenging, fast moving consumer goods environment in the U.S. However, growth and margins continue to improve in the emerging markets. In Watch we\u2019re driving revenue and EBITDA growth behind our total Audience Measurement and Marketing Effectiveness initiatives. Resiliency remains a key attribute of our overall portfolio.","Let me give a few more details on our total company performance in the third quarter. On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just over $1.64 billion, up 4.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets and Buy, partially offset by softness in our U.S. Buy market. In addition, foreign currency rates added 90 basis points to our revenue growth in the quarter.","Net income was $146 million, up 12.3%, and net income per share was $0.41 up 13.9%. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and lower restructuring charges.","Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis total revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 2 points to our revenue growth. Our core revenue which we define as total revenue less non-core or non-strategic assets grew 5.7% constant currency in the quarter. I will provide more color on the segments in just a few moments. Adjusted EBITDA was $522 million, up 4% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.8%, up 12 basis points on a constant currency basis. ","Our margins were driven by favorable mix and cost savings efforts that are driving efficiency and finding growth in both Watch and Buy. Free cash flow was $425 million, which was a record third quarter and was up 20.4% versus a year ago. We remain on track for our full year plan of approximately $900 million to fuel growth and return cash to our shareholders.","Next I\u2019ll move to the segments starting with Watch. The Watch segment continues to deliver solid revenue and EBITDA growth. Revenue was $838 million up 9.7% constant currency and net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 7 points to our Watch revenue growth. ","Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 16.5% on a constant currency basis. Excluding Gracenote, it grew 4.6% constant currency, led by strength in National TV and Digital. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns grew 44% in the quarter and we now have over 400 advertisers using the product, including all of the top 25 in the U.S. Digital Content Ratings, Digital and TV ratings and out-of-home measurement were also positive contributors to our third quarter growth.","Audio was down 7.3% constant currency in the quarter due to the timing of ratings deliveries, which skews quarterly growth rates from time-to-time. This dynamic represented about 130 basis points drag on Watch growth in the quarter and about a 60 basis points drag on the total company. Importantly, we expect audio to be roughly flat for 2017, consistent with the framework I gave for the year. ","Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.6% constant currency as we continue to leverage Watch and Buy assets to help advertisers and content publishers measure the return on investment in media spend and execute Audience Based Buy. Other Watch was down 19.2% constant currency due to the previously announced exits, a part of the telecom product offerings, content testing assets and our legacy net ratings product in the U.S. ","Watch adjusted EBITDA was $390 million up 7.7% constant currency. Watch margins were 46.5% down 84 basis points in constant currency. Excluding 138 basis points drag from Gracenote, Watch margins were up 54 basis points constant currency. Our Watch business continues to perform well and is delivering solid revenue and EBITDA growth.","Turning to Buy, the key takeaway is that year-to-date Buy revenue trends are in line with the framework we gave in 2Q, with continued strength in the emerging markets offset by a soft U.S. market. Third quarter total Buy revenue was $803 million, down 2.1% constant currency. Core Buy revenue was roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Previously announced dispositions were a 2 point drag to our Buy revenue growth. ","Our revenue in the developed markets was $491 million, down 5.4% constant currency behind continued softness in the U.S. and a tough comparison in Europe. The Developed Buy results year-to-date are in line with the full year framework we gave in the second quarter. ","Let me provide some additional color on the U.S. Sequentially the revenue declines are improving although the environment remains tough. As we have discussed, some of our clients are cycling through their own significant cost cuts and lowering overall spend. We expect this trend to continue for the next few quarters, however we also know that our measurement and analytics are critical and that over time clients must invest in the day-to-day need to drive growth and run their businesses. In addition, we are investing in coverage initiatives that will present growth opportunities for us in 2018 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more details at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks.","Our business in the emerging markets is exceptionally strong. Revenue was $297 million, up 10.8% constant currency. We are adding coverage and scale to drive broad based growth and margin expansion in all of our key markets. Our corporate Buy revenue was down 54.5% constant currency, reflecting pruning of noncore Buy assets that we have previously flagged. Buy EBITDA was $145 million, down 5.2% constant currency in the third quarter. We are investing in growth and efficiency initiatives across our businesses that will help us expand coverage and drive significant margin upside in Buy by 2020. ","Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don\u2019t take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 90 basis points increase in revenue and an 80 basis point gain on EBITDA. If yesterday\u2019s spot rates held constant through 2017, then we expect a 40 basis point benefit on revenue and an 80 basis points benefit on EBITDA for the full year.","Moving to 2017 guidance, we are maintaining our full-year guidance highlighted by EPS of $1.40 to $1.46 per share and free cash flow of approximately $900 million. On the right hand side we have updated our restructuring expense to approximately $85 million and D&A to approximately $650 million. ","Lastly, we remain committed to our balanced capital structure that is funding growth while enabling us to return cash to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and share buybacks.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mitch to provide more color on the quarter.","Mitch Barns","Thanks Jamere. I\u2019ll now provide some updates on our key initiatives and let\u2019s start with Watch. The rapidly evolving media landscape continues to be a source of opportunity and growth for Nielsen as it heightens the importance of independent, comparable and de-duplicated measurement across all platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to deliver this to the market.","Last quarter I highlighted three points that underscore the endurance of our strong position in measurement and our ability to drive new growth opportunities. During the third quarter we further strengthened our position as the leading measurement company across the media ecosystem. Let\u2019s hit those three points again.","First, the investments we\u2019ve made in Total Audience Measurement positioned us incredibly well for the future. Second, we made great progress in driving penetration of our digital offerings and we see significant growth opportunities ahead. Third, we\u2019re investing and this comes in all forms, new partnerships, acquisitions and new products, all driving incremental growth opportunities. Let me address you to these in more detail.","First, Total Audience Measurement; our system that provides independent, comparable, and de-duplicated measurement of both ads and content across all platforms. We see a lot of momentum here. Total Audience is the foundation for the future of our Watch business, providing measurement capability, scale and flexibility. The flexibility that we built into the system allows us to evolve along with the market, providing our clients with the most complete view of their audience for all types of viewing now and in the future. ","Our measurement of out-of-home viewing is a great example of being able to provide our clients with a more complete view of their audience. Since our April launch we\u2019ve seen tremendous demand for this important component of Total Audience. CBS and ABC are the latest of a longer list of 23 networks, leagues and agencies to sign on. Last month ESPN began offering a live total audience metric, which reflects traditional TV, as well as viewing via streaming devices and out-of-home and their advertisers are now transacting on those metrics. ","With all the talk about cord cutting lately, I want to highlight two types of viewing that are growing, partly as a consequence of cord cutting, both are captured by our Total Audience Measurement system. The first is viewing via so called skinny bundles like Sling TV, DIRECTV NOW, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu Live and others. We\u2019re capturing live viewing with our digital and TV ratings metric, with eligible viewing added to the C3\/C7 ratings. We\u2019re the only accredited measurement provider doing this at both the national and local levels.","The second type of viewing that\u2019s growing is viewing over the air using an antenna. Yeah, I know its old school, but this group of viewers is growing again. They are more multicultural and they are trending younger lately. In some local TV markets, over-the-air homes account for up to 65% of the stations audience for local news and sports. These viewers aren\u2019t represented in set-top-box data, but our measurement, thanks to our panels, captures these viewers well and always has. ","Also in Local TV we\u2019ve been investing in our plan to bring robust personal level electronic measurement to all of the 210 U.S. local markets. Our efforts are progressing well and we\u2019ll start to produce parallel data later this year.","Last week we announced the release of our new syndicated subscription video-on-demand measurement service. This is a significant enhancement to our previous solution which we launched roughly three years ago. We can now independently provide subscribing clients with data that shows how their programs are performing relative to other programs on Netflix. This is a big step forward. A number of major television networks and production studios have already signed up.","On total content ratings, nearly every major media brand is receiving and using live certified data from Nielsen. This is in part fueled by our Digital Content Ratings data that dozens of clients rely on every day. As we said before, in today\u2019s world, measurement is a team sport and we\u2019re working closely with our clients to help them as they use the data, whether it\u2019s internally or externally. ","We\u2019ve also been working closely with our clients to evolve the currency beyond the C3\/C7 definition. The consensus is narrowing and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll emerge as the currency for both Linier TV and Digital; in other words for all premium video. This has been a long journey, but there is no question that we\u2019re moving forward.","The second key point is around the progress we\u2019re making on increasing our penetration of digital measurement. We\u2019re relentlessly focused on expanding the range of use cases, adding flexibility and improving the user interface of our tools. Digital Ad Ratings has become the industry standard for major publishers, particularly on mobile. All of the top advertisers are using Digital Ad Ratings and we uniquely to measure PC and mobile exposure on YouTube, Snap, Pintrest, Twitter and Facebook. Also Digital Ad Ratings continue to grow internationally. We\u2019ll be in at least 32 countries by the end of this year.","For Digital Content Ratings, on last quarter\u2019s call I mentioned that we are enabled for secondary crediting of distributed video content on Facebook. In August we added Hulu and YouTube. We are the only provider with comprehensive measurement coverage of distributed content across all three of these platforms and this has led to some key competitive wins. Since our launch of Digital Content Ratings last fall, our progress has been accelerating.","Distributed video content on digital platforms is a growing trend because it offers incredible scale to digital media owners and they want measurement to capture the total audience for their content across all of these platforms. Digital Content Ratings does that, in fact it measures all types of video content on these platforms; long-form TV content, short clips and digital originals. The result for us is a growing client list, including Group Nine, a leading digital player for Millennial audiences.","Moving to my third point, we continue to invest in new growth opportunities. Last quarter we talked about our leadership position in Audience Based Buying beginning with Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Nielsen Buyer Insights and we\u2019re continuing to build on this. We recently announced a partnership with Clypd, a leading sales side platform for television advertising whose 60 broadcast and cable network clients represent close to half of TV\u2019s annual $74 billion ad spend. ","The partnership enables advertisers, agencies and publishers to transact using consistently defined audience segments on linier television. Advertisers can select the audience segments using a variety of behavioral attributes and then push those targets to networks for activation and guarantees. It\u2019s a great addition to the lineup of solutions we\u2019re supporting in the broader area of audience based buying. We\u2019re incredibly well positioned here.","We\u2019re leveraging our acquisition of Gracenote to bring new capabilities to linier TV ads in partnership with two leading interactive TV advertising providers Connekt and Ensequence. Using Gracenote\u2019s patented, Automatic Content Recognition or ACR technology, marketers can present special offers or custom promotions tied to their brands, driving deeper consumer engagement. For example, an automaker can enhance existing TV spots by adding interactive content such as local dealership address or a promotional discount. With our ACR technology embedded in 25 million Smart TVs, this has broad reach.","In marketing effectiveness where our Watch meets Buy, our growth in the quarter was driven by the Nielsen marketing cloud, which enables Audience Based Buying in the digital world. As Audience Based Buying of advertising grows, outcome based metrics are key to measuring the value of the audience delivered. Our recent acquisition of Visual IQ strengthens our already powerful capabilities in this area. By combining our marketing mix modeling outputs with Visual IQs attribution and ROI metrics, we help marketers to optimize across channels. Visual IQ\u2019s highly automated platform also allows us to take in and process large datasets more efficiently.","To sum up the overall picture for our Watch business, it\u2019s been a great year so far. We have a lot of momentum. Clients are embracing the solutions we brought to the market across both linier and digital and as the market continues to evolve; our Total Audience System is there to measure all of it.","Turning to Buy, our business in emerging markets continues to be robust, driven by our balanced portfolio of local and multinational clients, along with our investments in coverage and granularity. Revenues were up nearly 11% in the quarter led by strength in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Greater China. ","In developed markets the operating environment in the U.S. remains challenged, as our large fast moving consumer goods clients are faced with price and volume pressure in their own businesses. They are carefully managing their spending across all functions and our results continue to reflect these near term pressures. At the same time, we\u2019re continuing to invest for the long term, adapting and evolving to strengthen our leadership position for the future.","We are focused on three key efforts; first, efficiency. Driving automation and leveraging technology to enable a more scalable growth for our business. We\u2019re taking a number of actions to permanently reduce our cost base, enabling us to expand margins while also investing in our key growth initiatives. Across Buy and Watch we are focused on shrinking our operational footprint, reducing manual processes and increasing efficiency. All of these actions are designed to drive a stronger, higher margin business and ultimately to create value for our shareholders.","Second, we\u2019re increasing our presence in faster growing channels. As the retail landscape evolves, coverage expansion is critical to both manufacturers and retailers. We continue to build out our ecommerce measurement capabilities globally and we\u2019re now covering this channel in 16 countries. In the U.S. we launched our hybrid e-commerce solution earlier this year and are focused on growing the number of retailers that share e-commerce data directly. ","We\u2019re also expanding our reach into the fast growing value channel. Building on our expertise and strength with dollar stores, we make good progress with other major players in the value channel such as ALDI, one of the fastest growing retailers in the U.S. They recently selected Nielsen as their preferred data and analytics provider, covering nearly 1,700 stores in 35 states. ","And third, the connected system. Our open platform based system that integrates Nielsen\u2019s data and other data sources and then seamlessly connects measurement with the everyday analytics that our clients rely on to run their business. The system is designed to drive speed and efficiency for our clients, which is exactly what they need. ","We are making good progress on the roll out of the end-to-end connected system and we\u2019re on track to expand to 25 retailer and manufacturer clients by the end of this year and we\u2019ll increase that to 100 clients by the end of 2018. There is no shortage of demand from clients to be on that list. Clients are excited because when they see the connected system they understand why it is uniquely better than anything else out there. We are already seeing the positive impact of the Connected System in our renewal discussions for 2018, as well as with some competitive wins. ","Similar to Total Audience Measurement this will be a multiyear transformation as a business with some clients wanting the end-to-end system right away and others leveraging specific components to address their particular business needs. We have great momentum in our Connected Partner program which we launched 12 months ago. In that time the number of partners has growing to 36. We are also growing our portfolio of everyday analytics apps. Next up for launch is media budget explorer, a media optimization tool for brand mangers. ","We\u2019ll continue to build out these always-on analytics capabilities across a variety of other areas, including assortment and innovation. Demand for our apps has been strong. In total we now have 152 clients using at least one component of the Connected System, up from 106 that we reported on the second quarter call. ","To sum-up on Buy, emerging markets continue to be a growth engine and Developed Buy, the landscape in the U.S. remains challenging near term, but we are investing for the long term. We are making good progress on expanding our measurement coverage and on the development of the Connected System and its components.","Before I wrap up I want to thank our teams for their tireless efforts in the phase of natural disasters around the global over these past few months. The safety of our employees is always our first priority; however, our teams also did a tremendous job executing on our contingency plans to minimize disruption for our clients. ","At our investor day on November 9, we\u2019ll provide our outlook for 2018, along with more color on our plants to invest in innovation to drive growth and efficiency over the next several years. We look forward to seeing many of you there in person. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Gubins","Thanks Mitch. If you haven\u2019t registered for our Investor Day and you\u2019d like to attend, please contact the Investor Relations team. This year we\u2019ll be hosting the Investor Day at our Tampa, Florida operations facility and the event will also be webcast. ","So with that let\u2019s turn to Q&A. Carol, can you open up the line. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Todd Juenger","Hi, good morning everybody. Listen I know there is an Investor Day in two weeks, so I\u2019m going to ask this anyway realizing I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a lot more. But on the cost and the restructuring element of that, it looks like it was a pretty light quarter on restructuring, but then you took up your guidance for restructuring for the year, implying there is something bigger coming in Q4 and many be beyond. ","I wonder if you could talk a little more about what specifically is driving that. I assume it\u2019s in the Buy segment, but maybe not. Whatever you can tell us about that and how that rolls forward would be appreciated. If I could tack-on one super quick mini follow-up; Jamere I think last quarter you said the Buy segments developed revenue would flat in 2018. I just wanted to confirm that you still see it that way. Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Thanks Todd. First on restructuring, we do expect to step-up in the fourth quarter. Its primarily around rightsizing for some of the market realities that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in our Buy business. And the second piece of that is preparing for our 2018 productivity and efficiency initiatives and we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about those as you suggest in our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. ","On Developed Buy, again we\u2019ll share more details when we give our 2018 outlook in a couple of weeks. We do still expect the Developed Buy business to be down less in 2018 and in 2017 and as I said in my opening comments, we see the revenue declines in the U.S. improving sequentially although the environment remains challenging and we expect these dynamics to continue over the next few quarters. ","What give us confidence that the trends will improve are the following and I actually talked about these last quarter. One is, we have new wins with both retailers and manufacturers. The second things is we are renewing 100% of our long term contracts with our large global manufacturers and the third thing is our Connected System is actually giving us incremental capabilities that we are selling in during these renewals and that has a positive impact on the value of the agreement. ","So these three dynamics alone will drive improving trends in 2018. But how much better 2018 trends will be over 2017 is really based on you know what I\u2019ll call the fourth and final factor, which is client spending and candidly the environment is still tough. Clients are marking tough cost trade-offs and I expect it to continue for the next few quarters. We still believe ultimately they will need to invest more in the data and analytics that helped them grow their business and it\u2019s a question of the pace and timing that that spend. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Toni Kaplan","Hey, good morning. The gross rate in Developed Buy has been fluctuating quite a bit this year. So last quarter it seemed like it was getting a little bit better even though you did lower the full year guide. Would you expect to be closer to the bottom end of the 3% to 5% range and like basically if you could just give us a little bit of color on what drivers sort of these sort of large-ish deltas between quarters. I know comps is part of it and I know you just mentioned a couple of things in the last answer, but is it project revenue? Like how should we think about it just in terms of what specifically drives these deltas? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson","Yeah, thanks Toni. So year-to-date our Developed Buy revenue is down 4.6% and that\u2019s actually in line with the full year framework I gave last quarter. As we have been saying all along, we know that our measurement and analytics are critical and that over time clients must invest in the date they need to run their business. In the second quarter we saw this dynamic play out as clients actually spent a bit more behind some of their data and analytics needs, and this spending can be a little lumpy from time-to-time and in 3Q we actually saw a bit less spending. ","The second thing I\u2019ll say is that the U.S. improved sequentially after being down double digits in the first half and as I said in the second quarter, we expected a better second half and it played out that way in 3Q as the U.S. was actually down mid-singles in the third quarter. ","You know in Western Europe we said that we\u2019d have tougher comps in the second half, but the environment is as good as we\u2019ve seen it in three or four years. Western Europe actually grew high singles in the third quarter of 2016 which we did not expect to repeat. But on an underlying basis the demand is still pretty strong there. ","And then as it relates to the framework that we gave, you know we gave a framework of down 3% to 5% in 2017. Year-to-date we are down 4.6% as I said and with only quarter left in the year, I would expect this to be at the lower end of the year just given those results and the environment that we see for our FMCG clients. ","Mitch Barns","Yeah, what I\u2019ll add to this Toni, this is Mitch. On the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, if we look at the longer term, one thing I mentioned last quarter is in our conversations with our clients CEOs, they are recognizing broadly that the cost cutting, zero based budgeting activities are going to take them only so far and that they are going to have to start to invest in growth in their business, whether that\u2019s for new products or whether on their existing brands. ","So far we\u2019ve seen some of them start to act on that intention, but it remains to be seen just how fast this will develop through the end of this year and into 2018. It\u2019s something we are watching very closely. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Anj Singh","Hi, good morning. Thanks for talking my question. Just wanted to ask regarding your recent commercial release, SVOD, Content Ratings. It seems there is some chatter on the accuracy of the data and some pushback on that. So I was wondering if can share some thoughts and color on what the general reception and feedback has been amongst your initial set of subscribers and as you try to sign on additional subscribers. Just any color there would be helpful? Thanks. ","Mitch Barns","Yeah, thanks Anj. The initial market place reaction has been tremendous. Lots of excitement, lots of interest in this and so we are very pleased with the start that we are off too. I have seen some of that commentary about maybe the data is not perfect. These are comments made by people who probably don\u2019t have the data and so I have to take that in context. One thing I have seen is, hey, wait a minute, initially this doesn\u2019t cover mobile viewing, which is true, we\u2019ll add that later. But what may be surprising to some people is almost 90% of the viewing, even on Netflix takes place on the TV glass and mobile viewing, it\u2019s there and its meaningful, but its relatively small and certainly smaller than most people think. ","So we are very pleased about the initial reaction and interest. I think we\u2019ve had a product out there already for three years, but this new product is different and better and that it will offer a syndicated view of the market. In other words, subscribing clients will be able to see how their program compares to other programs from other studios, from other providers. That will be the new thing. ","And the second new thing about this new service is that we are now able to measure the audience for these programs independently. We are no longer relying on our clients to give us the audio track for the program as our previously product required. So we are really off to the races now, and again, very pleased with the initial reaction. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, two questions. One, is Aldi a new data contributor and two, my usual question. I want to know the organic revenue growth for Buy, Watch and overall?","Jamere Jackson","Okay, thanks Andrew. Let me hit the organic revenue again. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we had about 2 points of organic revenue in the quarter. So on a total Nielson basis, our organic revenue was up 1.5%. I also remind you again that we had about a 60 basis points drag from Audio timing in the third quarter that impacted that number. And Watch, our organic revenue is about 3%. Again we had about eight points added from Gracenote, offset by approximately a point from some of the other Watch assets. And then in Buy our organic revenue was flat and again that\u2019s 2 points a drag from the exit of assets and segmentation and customer research. ","Mitch Barns ","To your other question, this is Mitch Andrew, and your question about Aldi, initially our work with them will focus on analytics and that will be important for how they run their business and also how they engage with their suppliers and we\u2019ll build from there. So we are really excited. They are obviously a fast growing retailer in a hot space, in the U.S. market place right and we are really looking forward to building on this relationship with Aldi in the U.S. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, guys. My question is more on the Watch business. So you talked about out-of-home release, SBOD [ph] all the components of total audience over the last 12 months that are all sort of I think incremental contracts that you can assign with the clients. But then organic growth in the Watch business is still being you know 3% I guess this quarter and so forth. ","So what I\u2019m trying to understand is, are we early in the contribution of these products to your revenue growth or I think in the past you said you know lot of these initiatives probably just keep you in that 4% range. But just wanted to know what the latest thoughts and how we should think about the trajectory of Watch around those items?","Mitch Barns","I\u2019ll let Jamere add some color to this, but I think the last thing you said Manav is really the right way to think about this is generally with these new capabilities that we are bringing ","to the market. In other words, we have these broad engagements with our big clients. They want us first and foremost to measure the total audience across all screens and platforms and a lot of these new capabilities are about continuing our ability to do exactly that. And in doing that, what we also do is maintain our ability to continue to drive the mid-single digit growth that you have seen in this business over the last several years, so that\u2019s the way to think about it. ","In some cases they are incremental in the short term, but what they are really more about is preserving our ability to continue the kind of growth that you have seen over the last several years in this part of our businesses. ","Jamere Jackson ","And just a couple of things I\u2019ll add to that. One is, if I point to sort of the audience measurement in video and text, if you look at our growth there in the quarter its up close to 5%, that\u2019s in line with our framework. I\u2019ll say that our national and digital businesses remain solid and you know we also some improvement in our local business in the quarter as well. The numbers in Watch organically overall again being up about 3% actually had about 130 basis points drag from audio as I alluded to, so we\u2019ll be up a little bit over 4% without that impact. ","I think what you can expect from our Watch business is we\u2019ve said many times is, it\u2019s sort of a consistent steady growth. The initiatives that we have added to the portfolio have made this a growth to your business than it has been historically and we are pretty pleased with the execution by our teams and the adoption of those products in the market place. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Hi, thanks. I\u2019d like to pick up again on the underlying spending issue where the CPGs are. I understand your comments Jamere, especially about the sector remaining weak. It seems like it is, you said a little bit better in the U.S. in the quarter, but maybe a tough comp in Europe, and it\u2019s still kind of tough there. I guess my question is two-fold; one, is there still further deterioration possible in CPG sector spending or is it kind of flat line now and not good, but not getting worse, and that might be good enough. ","And relatedly, what about the retail sector; obviously a core sector on your Buy side. Heading towards year end, a lot of this comes in with a lot of pressure, cyclical structure, etcetera. Do we need to worry about retail sector underline spending with you?","Mitch Barns","Yeah, so a couple of things. One, as we\u2019ve said the environment is still tough. I mean clients are still making some really tough cost trade-offs and we expect that environment to continue for the next few quarters. Again, we ultimately believe that there will be more investment in data and analytics that help clients grow their business and it\u2019s a question really of the pace and timing of that. You\u2019ve seen the read through is not only from our results, but across really the entire supply chain feeding into the FMCG environment. ","From a retailer standpoint, obviously the retailer environment has gotten more competitive. We\u2019ve seen those dynamics play out in terms of the M&A activity that\u2019s happening in the industry. We\u2019ve also seen those dynamics play out in terms of the hard discounter into the U.S. so that environment is a little bit tougher as well. In terms of the impact on our spending, our retailer spending with us, we haven\u2019t seen that yet. Most of the pressure has actually been on the manufacturing side at this point. ","Jamere Jackson ","I think I would add to that is our business internally is stabilizing and even as the market continues to be challenging. Fundamentals of our business are improving. We\u2019ve been given a lot more focus to retailers in response to really what you have pointed to and what we are focused on is all the things that we can\u2019t control, so that we can manage through some of the impacts of the things that we can\u2019t control and I\u2019m really pleased with the trajectory of our business in the developed markets and especially the U.S. business. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Meuler","Yeah, thank you. A question on Local TV. You are calling out National TV and Digital as driving the growth in audience measurement. So I guess first, there have been some press reports or comments on the Sinclair and for a while now they continue. Last quarter you characterized I think as an ongoing client negotiation. Are you still characterizing it that way? ","And then the second bigger question is, I guess how are the improvements resonating with clients in terms of the set-top box and I mean your call about your ability to measure over the air where there is some share shift going, more electronic measure. Just are they resonating well with clients and obviously they are somewhat related. Thank you.","Mitch Barns","Yeah, thanks for the question. With regard to your first part of your question, related to Sinclair I\u2019m going to say the same thing I said last quarter and that we are not going to comment on that and that\u2019s it\u2019s a part of an ongoing active contract negotiation. ","With regard to our local business and the improvements we are making in the measurement product, we are on track with that program. It\u2019s a great program. What we are aiming to do is bring electronic measurement to all of the 210 markets in the U.S. for local television by the middle of 2018. We are incorporating set-top box data all across that measurement, that measurement system and its also going to bolster not only our measurement, but also our analytics offerings to our clients in that part of the market. ","In terms of how our clients are reacting, its resonating extraordinarily well. We are going to start to share parallel data with them later in this year. They will start to see how the new data compares to the data from the existing product that will gain comfort and then the product will start to prepare the \u2013 we\u2019ll start to prepare to flip over to that product in the middle part of next year. ","It\u2019s already having a positive impact. In fact on our contract renewals we mentioned some on previous calls like CBS and FOX Local and Entravision and again, we are really pleased by the market place reaction. It\u2019s a big set of changes, very complicated, but it\u2019s going to really bolster that part of our portfolio in a very important way. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on the Connected System. You mentioned 36 partners and 25 clients by the end of 2017. I just want to make sure I understood the difference between those two metrics and how they are tracking verses exceptions, but then also ask about how you think about the revenue contribution from Connected Systems in 2018 and 2019?","Mitch Barns","I\u2019ll take the first part, Jamere you can take the second. We are right on track Bill, with regard to the development of Connected System, right where we thought we would be at this time. When we refer to the 25 clients that we\u2019ll be engaged with by the end of the year, that includes the five charter clients and then we are adding to that and that will be exciting really to start to have the system in hands and more clients learn their way through it and it will start to play a role in their business as they reorient themselves around it. As we said those, there\u2019s a process, big change management process, especially on the side of our clients, so it\u2019s not like we flip the switch and they switch over right away. It takes them a little bit of time. ","The 36 that we mentioned refers to the number of partners who are part of our Connected Partner Program and these connected partners are providing apps that run on our platform. They tap into the data and address recurring business questions that our clients have. So by opening up our data to this ecosystem of third party application providers, it really increases the underlying value of the data that we\u2019re providing to the marketplace. ","So it\u2019s that open approach that we\u2019ve been taking, not only here, but in other parts of our business and we\u2019re really pleased with the response, the interest of companies to be part of that Connected Partner Program and I\u2019ll tell you, our clients absolutely love it, absolutely. So yeah, again we feel great. We\u2019re on track right where we thought we would be and excited for the next couple of quarters ahead to see the development continue. Jamere.","Jamere Jackson","Yeah, so we do expect some revenue from the connected system. Some of which will be incremental, specifically the revenue from the connected partner program. The second dimension as I mentioned earlier is that the connected system has actually given us some incremental capabilities to sell in during renewals and this is actually having a positive impact on those agreements. ","We are starting to see some new client wins that are based on the capabilities of the connected system and we\u2019ll have some announcements to that affect in the future. But as Mitch said, our primary focus really is on conversions and we expect that ramp to be in the back half of next year and we are getting very good client feedback and the teams are executing well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of modeling questions if I could. I guess first, would you be willing to quantify the contribution to watch from digital first clients, either as a percentage of total watch revenue or any sizing you might be able to provide there. You know is it larger than local TV or something along those lines. ","And then secondly, would you be willing to quantify what Visual IQ could contribute in the fourth quarter and then relatedly, you guys talked about more pruning in the Watch other portfolio that was down a little more than expected in the quarter. With Visual IQ coming in and maybe the other stuff coming down a little bit should we expect marketing effectiveness I guess to probably move towards the higher end of the range and the other piece to maybe move below that prior guide of down 10%? Any color around those housekeeping items would be helpful. Thanks guys.","Jamere Jackson","Yeah, so a couple of things. On marketing effectiveness, you know we saw our marketing effectiveness assets this quarter deliver 15.6% growth, that was all organic, so no acquisitions are relevant in that numbers and that\u2019s really driven by the progress that we\u2019re seeing with Nielsen Catalina Solutions, the Marketing Cloud, Repucom, they were all up double digits. So we do see strong demand and higher growth in the second half on those products and we feel good about the 15% to 20% range.","In terms of Visual IQ, this is an acquisition that we\u2019re actually really excited about the capabilities of Visual IQ, because it is falling right in the suite space of an area that has very high demand from our clients around marketing mix modeling and multi touch attribution. The revenue contribution won\u2019t be significant. This really is a Buy versus Build situation for us where we actually get to market faster with a much better product. It will actually cannibalize some of the revenue in our existing business in the near term, but longer term it will be accretive to growth. ","And then in terms of digital, while we don\u2019t break out necessarily our digital revenue, we feel pretty good about a few things. Number one, the progress that we are making with Digital Content Ratings and Digital Ad Ratings and digital TV ratings are all products and progress that is accretive to the growth rate in the Watch business. So to the earlier question around whether or not we are seeing incremental growth in the business, those things are actually contributing to the growth of the business and its why we\u2019ve been you know sort of marching along at a pretty steady growth rate in our Watch business over the last couple of years.","And then on your last point on other Watch, we\u2019ll be on track for the prior framework of down 10% for the year in 2017.","Mitch Barns","Two quick things I\u2019d like to add to that. I understand why you\u2019d want to know the specific contribution from digital products to digital first clients. What I also want to highlight is our digital products are important to almost all of our Watch revenues. Just the way our clients think about what we\u2019re doing, what they need us to do, there is no way we accomplish what they need us to do without the digital products in our portfolio and so it really has an impact all across our revenue base. ","Visual IQ, one thing to add there, we are going to leverage obviously their capabilities in the digital world, but another real big benefit of them is their automated platform. It will drive unbelievable speed and efficiency. Let me give you an example. Right now we do marketing mix modeling for our clients. We\u2019re the largest marketing mix modeling provider in the world. All the top 10 companies in the U.S. for instance use our marketing mix modeling services, but it is a labor intensive process and it takes just usually several months to deliver a project to a client using Visual IQs platform. ","We\u2019ll take a process that takes a couple of months to update models and we\u2019ll be able to do that in a couple of hours. We\u2019ll be able to deliver refreshed metrics almost on a daily basis if our clients would like us to do that. So we\u2019re talking about a huge step change here and this will be one to watch. I would encourage you to watch. We\u2019ll have more to say about it at our Investor Day on November 9. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian Wieser","Alright, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you know you guys seen that one of your main competitors CEOs just now is probably leaving. In January their CFO just left recently. I am wondering to what degree, especially in the audience measurement space that you feel that the weakness if you will on part of your competitors, is it providing more ground to build more trends with your clients faster than whatever else had been the case or do you think that their completive intensity hasn\u2019t changed at all and this is just \u2013 your actually performing well despite a strong competitor. And maybe just quickly relatedly, I was wondering if you could just comment on the results in the Audio business this quarter.","Mitch Barns","I\u2019ll take the first part and Jamere you get the second. I don\u2019t think our performance is that closely correlated to anything happening at a competitor. Really it\u2019s much more about our ability to execute on our strategy to deliver to our clients what they need, to continue to shape and grow their businesses given the changes that are happening in the marketplace. So again, I think it really highlights the incredible execution of our Watch teams bringing all of these different products to the marketplace and having them exist independently, but also work together in this interoperable system that is total audience measurement.","On the accounts for a CEO leaving, look he is a good man and I hope he stays involved in the industry. He has been a real positive factor in the industry for a number of years, so we wish him well.","Jamere Jackson","Yeah, on the Audio timing, you know we saw the results in the quarter being down roughly 7%. It was all timing. So as you\u2019ve seen us report from time-to-time, the timing of the deliveries of an Audio will impact our growth rates. So last year in the third quarter we had more of the deliveries in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter this year. It\u2019s a little bit more balanced so you saw that skew the rates. That should balance out between the 3Q and 4Q results.","On an underlying basis, we expect the Audio business to be you know roughly flat for the year, which is in line with the framework that we gave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Mchugh from William Blair & Co. Please go ahead.","Tim Mchugh","I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the Buy margins I guess. Is it just a function of investing and at the same time I guess negative leverage or is there any sign I guess of underlying kind of pricing pressure or I guess ability to monetize the product as you face pressure from the clients or any other issues I guess impacting the margins that we should think about there?","Mitch Barns","Great, so on the margins in Buy, you know the developed margins are obviously under pressure due to the fact that we got a softer revenue environment and you know we\u2019ve actually been taking cost actions there that are aimed at right sizing our business for those market realities. I think importantly none of these actions actually impact our ability to invest in our key initiatives. In the emerging markets margins are actually improving as we\u2019re gaining scale and there\u2019s still more work to be done here. And then the final point is we\u2019re continuing to invest in coverage and the connected systems. So we see those dynamics sort of playing through the Buy margin results through the first three quarters of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from [inaudible] from Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning gentlemen. I actually just to clarify some earlier comments around the developed markets Buy business. Last quarter I left with the impression that your expectations for growth in 2018 were to be relatively flat and so on this call I heard that maybe you\u2019re looking at trends to continue to improve year-over-year. There seems to be a delta in my mind for that give that the developed markets is down roughly about 4.5% year-to-date, so between 0% to 4.5%. Any additional color on that? ","Mitch Barns","Yeah, so again as I said, we\u2019ll share more details when we give our 2018 outlook in a couple of weeks. We do expect Developed Buy to down less in 2018 and 2017 and as I said in my opening comments, the U.S. is actually improving; fundamentals are improving, although the environment there remains challenging. ","Again there are three things that we feel very good about heading into next year, it\u2019s our wins with retailers and manufacturers. As we go through our operating plans we are looking at our contract renewals with our large global manufacturers. We are renewing all of those at 100%. I think the environment there is getting better. The Connected System has given us incremental capabilities to sell in. We\u2019ll see some incremental revenue from the Connected Partner program. So those three things are the dynamics that will help us drive improving trends in 2018. ","And the final factor as I said is what happens in the client environment, and it\u2019s still tough and clients are making cost trade-offs. We expect that to continue for the next few quarters and it\u2019s a question of the pace and timing of that spending set back.","Jamere Jackson ","I mentioned earlier to the question from Toni, that client CEOs are clear, that they know they need to invest in growth in their business but only some of them have actually started to take action of that yet and so that\u2019s really going to be the wildcard. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Can you just tighten up for us the approximately 4% growth in \u201917 and just where does that come? Like what\u2019s going to be Watch, what\u2019s going to be Buy. Like is there a way to just tighten that range a little bit and then as we think about \u201918, is there a way to little longer term -- can we still kind of think about mid-single digit type organic growth in the business or just any thoughts on that given what are the puts and takes?","Jamere Jackson","Yeah, so we gave a framework last quarter on this and I\u2019ll just reiterate that. We said our total Buy business is down 2.5% to 3%. On a year-to-date basis we are at about 2.6% down. Developed Buy we said is going to be down minus-3 to minus-5 year-to-date. As I said we are at about 4.6% and given that we have one quarter left in the year. We don\u2019t expect improvement in the fourth quarter. Emerging markets 8% to 10%. You know we\u2019ve been trending towards the high end year-to-date, just a little over 10% and then corporate is down 60 year-to-date, we\u2019re down 54.5. So that gives you the pieces for the Buy business being down 2.5% to 3%. ","On the Watch business we said up 11% to 13% year-to-date. We\u2019re at 10.6%. Audio is going to be flat. We had a 130 basis points headwind in the third quarter that won\u2019t repeat on the Watch side of our business. Audience measurement in Video and Text, 14% to 16% marketing effect is 15% to 20% and other Watch as I said down 10%. So that just give you the framework for how we see the guidance shaping up and we said new change to our overall guidance. We\u2019ll give guidance on 2018 in our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, and we\u2019ll unpack all the details at that time. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. ","Tom Eagan","Great, thank you. Just Mitch I had a question on your latest thoughts and some of the new media measurement developments. Like for example, the rollout of OpenAP. Do you think that will gain traction with advertisers and other TV network groups? And then secondly your thoughts on the new store concept and how that compares with what you do with Visual IQ. Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Yeah, thanks Tom. OpenAP is one of a number of things that is happening in the market place to enable audience base buying. That enables advertisers to select specific audience that they want to target and then direct their spend against those audiences and they can activate on those audiences and in some cases the systems also enable them to have guarantees offered to deliver those audiences. ","So OpenAP is one of several systems that are being stood up in order to support this interest that\u2019s growing in the market place. It\u2019s so early with respect to OpenAP and so there is not a whole lot to say about that yet. We are looking forward to being involved in it as it does expand, but we are also supporting some other approaches to this. We already have our Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Nielsen Buyer Insights capabilities that also support audience based buying. We also announced this partnership with Clypd that does something somewhat similar to what OpenAP is designed to do. ","So I think you are going to see more of these and the beauty for us at Nielson is we are going to be able to support them all and its going to create incremental growth opportunity for us. We are really very well positioned to support audience based buying, because we not only have the data to do it, but importantly we have the universe estimates. ","The reason why that\u2019s important is, it\u2019s one thing to be able to say you know here is how you can go reach specific kinds of consumers. It\u2019s another thing to say just how big is that group of consumers in the real world and it\u2019s that second thing in particular that we are uniquely positioned to do. When people start putting money against these audience segments, that second question is going to be really important. So again, we are in a good spot as far as how this is going to develop. ","With regard to [inaudible] that\u2019s about attribution in the marketplace and this is really what we do and our marketing effect in this business on an everyday basis, connecting the exposure of an add to the subsequent sale of a brand in the market place. This is the oldest question in advertising frankly. You\u2019ve heard the old saying, I know half of my advertising is a wasted, I just don\u2019t know which half. Well in today\u2019s world we actually know which half, because we have the data and the technology to pinpoint it and that\u2019s what our marketing effect in this business is all about; is helping people driver more precession, more efficiently in their advertising spend to drive up the ROI and one of the best ways to do it is through attribution modeling. ","And that\u2019s exactly what Visual IQ does in the digital world, and that\u2019s why I said by combining what they do in the digital world with attribution, with what we do mostly in the linier TV world with our marketing mixed modeling capabilities, we really have a world beating combination of capability there. And then to do it on their automated platform allows us to do with incredible speed and efficiency and so as the desire for attribution continues to grow in the market and it definitely well, we are going to be in a really good spot to capture that growth opportunity. ","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Arthur from Huber Research. Please go ahead. ","Doug Arthur","Follow up on local TV measurement. I know it\u2019s not a big part of the Watch business and I know obviously there\u2019s some contact issues out there right now. Is it fair to say that when you get the rollout of all your initiatives in the second half of \u201918 that you expect it to be an area of growth again or is it a growth area right now, thanks.","Mitch Barns","Well it did grow a bit this quarter. In the third quarter it\u2019s up a little bit more than a percent. So it\u2019s not a lot, but it is some growth and we like growth anywhere we can get it. And yeah, as this new product capability rolls out to the market place, it\u2019s going to bring more stability to the ratings, more granularity to the data as well. ","What that will probably do is open up additional analytics capabilities for us to support our clients who are either selling advertising or buying advertising in the market place and that\u2019s probably where more of the incremental contribution will come into play. As far as this turning into a big growth contributor, long term we are going to be tied to the growth of advertising spending in this particular part of the market and that\u2019s been a tough story over the last couple of years and probably will continue to be a low growth environment from a total advertising spend over the next few years. ","Operator","There is no further time for questions today. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Barns for closing remarks. ","Mitch Barns ","Yeah, thanks very much. Just to sum-up, in Watch solid growth with audience measurement of Video and Text. We are driving towards being the currency for all premium video content with linier TV and digital. Marketing effectiveness continues to see solid double digit growth and really the continued ramp of total audience measurements and all the products that we are bringing to the market like Out-of-Home, subscription video on-demand measurement, digital and TV ratings, all these are supporting the continued growth of this part of our business. ","In Buy, emerging markets is really the key growth driver, up almost 11% in the quarter and its leveraging our leadership position in all of the faster growing emerging markets. We are progressing on track with our development at the Connected System, including our in-house Apps and the Connected Partner program. We have a 152 clients now using at least one part of the connected system; that\u2019s triple what we reported in the first quarter of this year. We continue to invest in coverage in our Buy business with value retailers, specialty outlets and of course ecommerce. ","Our Gracenote acquisition is performing well and its having a great first year as part of Nielson. Across Watch and Buy, we are investing and innovating to drive efficiency in growth, and the way we look at it, it\u2019s a goldmine of opportunity. Automation and consolidation or operations will driver efficiency and enable more scalable growth from our strategy to provide uniquely better products that provides value for our clients and our shareholders.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to the host, Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Vanek, please proceed.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us today to discuss Nielsen's Second Quarter 2013 Financial Performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is David Calhoun, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you all that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of '95.

It is also in the Appendix of the webcast slide presentation we're using on today's call and on our IR website.","And so, for our agenda. For today's call, Dave will start with some comments on our results for the quarter and an overview of some key highlights. He will then provide a business update and then close with an update on our capital allocation plan. Then Brian will discuss financials for the quarter and will provide updates on our full year guidance. And then, we'll be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","And to start the call now, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, David Calhoun.","David L. Calhoun","Yes. Hello. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to run through these highlights briefly, quickly so that we can get to our Q&A. We had a very solid second quarter performance. Our revenue grew 3% on a reported basis, 4% on a constant currency basis. Our Watch business grew on a constant currency basis, 5%; and our Buy business grew 3%, again, in constant currency. We had a 3% constant currency growth in Insights, and we've clearly seen the shift in momentum with respect to positive Vs going forward.","Adjusted EBITDA grew 6%, 6% on a constant currency basis, as well as reported. Adjusted net income grew 25%, 23% on a constant currency basis.","Our free cash flow generation of $106 million more than doubled versus the prior year. And as you know, our cash balance stands tall at almost $1.2 billion, largely as a result of the successful Expositions sale for $935 million.","Our management team remains in what we call a full investment mode, and we're focused on, I think, the things you are aware of, innovative solutions for advertisers and coverage expansion, particularly in the emerging markets around the world.","On the M&A front, our Arbitron regulatory process is ongoing. We remain confident our second -- our request for information has been fulfilled. The FTC is working in a very workmanlike process to get to their conclusions. And we believe, by the end of August, we'll have an indication of where things are.","Updating our capital allocation plan will come in the next couple of pages. We have a real focus on shareholder return, and we continue to get increasing visibility on the excess cash that we intend to return to shareowners.","Key milestones over the quarter. 58% of our share ownings now are in the hands of institutional equity owners; and Nielsen, as everyone knows, is now included in the S&P 500 Index.","We will update our guidance. Brian will take you through a chart, specifically for the Expositions disposition. Otherwise, the guidance remains intact. So we love the strategic positioning that will occur as a result of the 2 transactions that are 1 done and 1 in front of us, and we think it spells good things for future growth and profitability, ultimately shareholder value.","Page 6. With respect to key growth catalysts initiatives, again, as I mentioned, we continue to drive investment and growth in Africa, China, India; and we have begun to step up plans for Mexico, as we get more bullish on the -- on that [ph].","We are enhancing value to our clients, largely through our advertising solutions business. As you will recall, this is where our syndicated data in Watch meets the syndicated data in Buy. We create solutions that in effect -- in effect, answer the question, \"What is my return on investment in advertising dollars?\" This is, again, a very strong initiative for us, and it's growing at a very fast pace.","We continue to activate our Buy data; Global Track, which is a tool that large multinationals can use to, in effect, make global resource allocation decisions faster; Total Store Read, which is basically capturing all of that -- all of the data that exists in our big retail clients; Catalina, as we talked before; and Buyer Insights, which is the business we have with credit card data marrying our Watch data, largely for the benefit of retail clients.","We've continued to increase the reach of Online Ratings. We are moving from campaign to program ratings, which largely fulfills the needs of media clients and ad agency planners to help bridge the digital world.","We're developing Social TV ratings. We now have 50 clients for our SocialGuide product. And of course, our Twitter -- our Nielsen TV Twitter ratings will be introduced here in the fall upfronts.","We're expanding our core video measurement internationally. We've had some wins out there, and we continue to capture more audiences across more devices.","So all of these growth initiatives continue to be funded, and we feel good about the progress we're making in each case.","Page 7. Just, again, an update to our capital allocation plans. As I said before, as every quarter goes by, we get more and more visibility to the excess cash that our business continues to generate and sort of the forward momentum that we have increasingly more confidence in.","So with respect to updating our plans, first and foremost, we will continue to fully fund all of our organic growth programs, as well as our M&A, which, as many know, is largely built around tuck-in acquisitions.","We are on course to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.75x to 3x, ahead of our 2016 refinancing, and that continues to be an objective we mean to fulfill.","Third, we're committed to dividend growth. We will increase our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20, and we continue to have an intent to grow this with earnings over time.","We will also announce a share repurchase program, largely to mitigate dilution associated with the equity compensation programs that we introduced back in 2006. This is a $500 million share repurchase program, as we look forward to the implementation of that program over the next several years.","Again, the framework here -- our commitment is to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders and to continue to do it in a very deliberate fashion, as our confidence continues to grow.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian West.","Brian J. West","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Page 9 of the webcast slides.","I'd first like to just describe the table in front of you. What we chose to do was take the key indicators of our business down the left-hand side, and the first column represents our results, including Expositions since the Expositions transaction closed so late in the quarter, as just a benchmark point. The middle column is what the Expos impact would be since now it's been eliminated and it's put into discontinued operations. So it's $43 million lower on the revenue line, $20 million lower on the adjusted EBITDA line, $17 million for ANI and then $0.04 per share. Then to get to a net total reported number, these are the total reported numbers that are in our filings, and that we will discuss going forward.","I will say that the Expos disc ops treatment is well covered in exhibits in both the press release, as well as the filing, in order to help everyone understand and update their models and to be as transparent as we possibly can. So it's all in there.","So moving on with the reported results. Second quarter revenue was $1.39 billion, that's up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was $396 million, that's up 6% in constant currency. And margins expanded a very healthy 67 basis points to 28.6%.","We did see the impact of foreign exchange rates in the quarter, and there was a 40 basis point drag on revenue and a 30 point basis drag on EBITDA.","Adjusted net income came in at $187 million, up a strong 23%, driven by the underlying operating performance, as well as the interest benefits from capital structure actions and our ongoing favorable tax attributes. Adjusted net income per share was $0.49.","And finally, we generated $106 million of free cash flow in the quarter, that's more than double last year, driven by the operations, working capital favorability and the interest benefit.","So in summary, solid top and bottom line growth, coupled with terrific free cash flow generation.","Moving on to Page 10. 2Q had another consecutive quarter of top line growth. Total Buy was $867 million, that's up 3% in constant currency. The Information services business was $652 million, also up 3% in constant currency, with gross -- growth across major regions with exception of Western Europe, which I'll get to in a moment. Insights was $215 million, returning to growth of 3% in constant currency. And as Dave mentioned, we're seeing good momentum across the board for Insights.","Developing markets were up 6%. And in some markets, we continue to see strong double-digit growth, driven by rapidly expanding local client revenue. So we still feel very optimistic about our developing market prospects. And finally, Watch revenue, $519 million, up 5%. Very solid results in the core U.S. measurement business, complemented by stronger performance in international measurement, digital and advertiser solutions, that last business which contributed strong double-digit growth in the quarter.","Let me just speak to Europe for a moment. Page 11 attempts to describe our Europe exposure. So the bar chart is the first half revenue in 2013 for the total company of $2.7 billion split on the bottom segment, which is Nielsen Rest of World, with exception of Western Europe, was at $2.2 billion; and then, Western Europe at about $0.5 billion, which is less than 20% of the total.","So in total, in the first half, the first V% column, that's the year-over-year growth, constant currency, company grew 4%. But there's really 2 things happening here. The Nielsen Rest of World, the bigger part, grew 5%; and Western Europe was down 1%. And that's primarily driven by the discretionary business of Insights.","And we also have the 3-year CAGR on there. The total business has done 5% CAGR. But again, Nielsen Rest of World, 6%; Europe is flat. So we just want to point this out to remind everyone that it's the fourth year of broad market headwinds, but it's a manageable exposure for us. We still grow. We've taken the necessary cost actions. We've also made the right readjustments with clients to get through this. We're delivering growth in certain countries, including U.K. and Italy. And we're winning business.","So we feel like we're well positioned on the actions we've taken, and we have a responsible outlook and that we don't expect this picture to get any better. And all things considered, we think we're weathering this one very well.","Moving on to Page 12, profitability. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $396 million, that's up 6% constant currency. Again, margins expanded by 67 basis points. Buy EBITDA was $171 million, up 2%, as we continue to make discretionary investments to fund long-term growth. Watch EBITDA was $233 million, up 9%, reflective of the scalability of the business model, as we grow services such as Ad Solutions that are very attractive margin rates. And overall, we continue to deliver on cost management and productivity programs as we fund long-term growth investments.","Page 13, a reminder on foreign exchange. The bar chart reflects our quarterly actual and projected impact from FX rates on the reported results. We do see the impact of fluctuation in rates as we translate for reporting purposes since over 50% of our revenues are outside the U.S. In 2Q, as I mentioned, a drag of 40 bps on the top and 30 bps on EBITDA. And if rates -- all rates stayed the same as of last Friday, the total year revenue drag projected would be 90 basis points for the year on revenue, and the EBITDA drag would be about 80 basis points. And this is a little bit worse than last time we updated, but we watch this closely. And I remind everyone that we report on a constant currency basis because that is the true reflection of our operating performance.","Moving on to cash and the balance sheet, Page 14. Free cash flow in the quarter was $106 million, double last year. And for the first half, we have generated $90 million of free cash flow, and that's up $130 million versus the first half of last year.","CapEx came in at $100 million. It's higher based on both some timing but also higher investment levels as we prepare for key commercial wins, 2 additional TV measurement markets as well as a big global multinational that came our way. So we're excited about fulfilling all that.","Cash tax is $37 million, driven by our favorable long-term tax attributes. And restructuring came in at $22 million on the cash line. The restructuring charge on the P&L for the second quarter was $8 million.","On the balance sheet, gross debt came at $6.25 billion. Cash, as Dave mentioned, healthy at $1.16 billion based on the Expos sale proceeds to get you to a net debt of just over $5 billion.","On the capital table, fairly quiet on the capital table this quarter. Net debt was down to 3.3x, in large part due to the Expos cash; and our weighted average interest rate was essentially flat at 4.5%.","We continue to focus on de-risking the debt profile. And as we stand here today, we have increased our fixed debt portion of our cap structure to 80% and we continue to closely manage the portfolio over time.","Finally, Page 15, on guidance. As Dave mentioned, we're going to update for Expos. But starting with the elements on the left-hand side, no change to revenue growth at 4% to 5%; no change to adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 40 to 60 bps; and no change to adjusted net income growth of 15% to 19%, all of that on a constant currency basis.","Deleveraging. We haven't changed it, but we'll have a better update post the Arbitron close.","CapEx. We took that up a bit, $10 million to $15 million, based on the commercial wins I mentioned.","Depreciation and amortization. That is $20 million lower based on Expositions, largely the acquisition D&A.","Net book interest is $15 million lower, $10 million related to Expos and $5 million based on better rates. And there's no changes to cash taxes or cash restructuring. And we updated our share count.","On the right-hand side, just a reminder that our previous net income per share, including Expos, was $2.13 to $2.19. We take out the annual impact of Expositions now that's it been disposed of and characterized in disc ops of $0.24 to get you to a net income per share at current rates of $1.89 to $1.95.","And I'll also remind you that the annualized accretion from the pending acquisition of Arbitron is $0.26. That's $0.13 that we always talked about when we close the deal, largely driven by cost synergies, as well as $0.13 benefit because we're raising less debt to do the transaction. Net-net, it's going to have an accretive annual impact once we close it, and we feel confident in the synergies that we have lined up for that transaction. So operational guidance is reiterated and the solely adjustment has been for Expos disposition.","With that, I will turn it back over to Kate.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks, Brian. And, Amy, we'd like to turn it to the first question now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suzi Stein at Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","To what extent could you be impacted by the recent merger activity in the ad space? Can you just comment on that, please?","David L. Calhoun","Suzi, it's a good question, and we're, of course, looking hard at it. I honestly -- it's hard to find any negative impacts for us. As you know, both of these are run as a sort of a collection of agencies. Largely, the work that they want to do and talk about with respect to data tends to complement the work that we do. And so, I view that as a positive. If they can plow more resources into data, that's a good thing for us, believe it or not. They will use more of our measurements within their planning tools, et cetera. So it's not really a bad outcome for us. I sort of have a view, I agree with all of the environmental statements that both of the leaders made with respect to why. I also understand the need for consolidation benefits. To the extent they reinvest that in things that we do, I view it as a positive. But I don't -- there's nothing with respect to our revenue profile or contractual stuff that is a negative in any way. So net-net, I view it as a plus.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, can you just comment on the $500 million share repurchase? Will the timing of that be impacted at all by the timing of the closing of Arbitron, or do you view those as completely separate?","Brian J. West","Suzi, we view those as completely separate.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just continuing on the capital return. Can you talk a little bit about your philosophy around dividends versus buybacks? It does sound like the buyback is primarily to offset dilution. But I just wanted to get a better understanding of that because it had sounded in past conversations with you, Brian, that you guys have a peculiar view about that. I just want to be clear.","David L. Calhoun","Yes, Matt. You're precise -- you're exactly right -- haven't changed with respect to the philosophy I've been talking about since the first day. This is a company that should have a dividend model; it should have an aggressive dividend model. I've been leaning into that. And as I say, every step we take, every quarter we take with respect to visibility and the cash performance of the company, again, gives us more confidence. That's the lever I prefer to pull. The buyback for us is literally just a case of wanting to cover the dilutive effects of a share repurchase program that's still reasonably in its infancy. And so, in my view, that's the right thing to do. We got enough feedback from our respective shareowners that that's something they would like to see. But I have a clear preference, as you know, for dividend model over time.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, yes. And I would like to talk a little bit about the revenue momentum in the business. You reiterated your full year guidance. In terms of the moving parts, Watch is coming on strong, Insights is coming back to positive a quarter early, but Information services is a bit weak and decelerated more than expected. So it just -- with you guys doing 4.1% constant currency growth year-to-date and still looking for 4% to 5% for the full year, to us, that implies acceleration in the back half of the year despite the Walmart comp. So I'd like to understand a little bit more about some of those moving pieces and what instills your confidence in the outlook?","Brian J. West","So I think you described perfectly, Matt, the pieces. So we know that Walmart will sunset. We expect that. We know that Western Europe is not going to get any better. But to the ones you pointed out, Insights is going to have some momentum. We've got some very nice momentum in Watch driven by a variety of fronts, both advertiser solutions, international measurement wins, as well as our digital portfolio. So when you take all of those puts and takes together, we feel confident in the range.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Bank at RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit -- in terms of advertiser solutions, can you talk philosophically why is that within the Watch segment of revenue as opposed to the Buy segment if it merges kind of the 2 products? And can you also talk about -- is this a handful of big clients all of a sudden, or is it more, sort of, broadly being adopted? Or what -- and what exactly is the impact in terms of incremental revenue from this 1 product because it seems to be a pretty big driver? I realize you're not going to tell me exactly. But can you give a little bit more color around it?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, yes. Thanks [indiscernible] someday, we will. Listen, you're right. So we debate this inside all the time, but the reason we tend to lean toward Watch is because, when we talk about advertisers and solving for advertisers, our clients, the big consumer product companies and automotive companies, et cetera, they have this embedded in the CMO's office, typically with sort of a Watch community. That's how they think about it. Whereas, our Buy side business tends to be associated with the brands and the research work they do around sort of consumers and brands. So it's really the way our clients talk about it. But all that said, as this continues to progress and as it continues to get bigger, there will be a day when we will have, in my view, a Watch\/Buy segment. And as we get our arms around that and begin to develop it, that will become clearer and clearer to everybody. It's a horse for us. It continues to be a horse. It's a strategic advantage in what we do. And I know we need to put more color around it. But it's big, it's profitable and it continues to be the story between these 2 big segments.","Brian J. West","The other thing I want to add on that, David, is that it is 1 space where we get to expand to many different verticals, not just media or CPG, but advertisers across telco, retail, auto, financial services. There's lots of opportunities with lots of clients that we've never touched before, and that's driving the growth.","David L. Calhoun","And the short answer to the other question is it is, in fact, broad-based.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur at Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just going back to the revenue momentum in the Buy segment. Developing markets looked like they accelerated in the quarter, but developed markets slowed down quite a bit. And now, obviously, you've highlighted Europe. Did you see a slowdown in any other major developed markets besides Europe? And then, I've got a follow-up on margins.","Brian J. West","It was -- Doug, it was Western Europe for sure, and developing held in nicely. It's in that 6% range. It's been there. And it's basically -- the developed is Western Europe.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So probably not going to see a change there near term. And then, Brian, on margins, your Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were sort of flattish again. I mean, is this -- obviously, Western Europe, but is it also the investment program? And so, when might there be some relief on that on the margin side?","Brian J. West","Doug, this is driven by our investment appetite. As we look around the world and we look at markets that we want to go increase and expand coverage in, we get excited about more opportunities, not less, and that's driving the very deliberate focus on reinvestment. So Dave mentioned Mexico is the next one. So look, we hope there's never a day we stop investing. We know, over time, these markets perform beautifully once we get done investing in the local client's book of business billed. So we think this is a great situation for us, and we're going to keep investing.","David L. Calhoun","Yes. The only thing I would add to that -- a reminder, in the emerging markets, you always start with a Buy side investment. It really is that retail measurement, finding new distribution outlets for clients, et cetera. This is how it all starts. The Watch side of a business in the emerging markets doesn't develop until maybe decades later. So this is -- that's why the Buy side is the -- carries the burden of emerging market development.","Operator","The next question comes from William Bird at Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","David, I was wondering if you could just comment again on Arbitron. You mentioned that you expect to have an indication of where things stand in late August. What happens in late August?","David L. Calhoun","Well, they have a period of time, a window that they're committed to by law to get back to us with respect to the second request for information that we now have submitted. So they -- the -- it is on them to come back to us. So all I can tell you is the process has been very workmanlike, and nothing has surfaced over the course of that process that's either surprising or different than anything we thought about going into it. So I get it. It's always longer than anybody would like, but I think the dialogue has actually been pretty healthy for everybody. So -- anyway, that's really it. It's -- the course is determined by law.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And can you talk about, just progress report on Online Campaign Ratings?","David L. Calhoun","Yes, I still, still feel very good about it, confident in it. I know there's a lot of, sort of, flak that gets thrown around in the marketplace about winning and losing and all that kind of stuff. But I will tell you, with respect to video, with respect to the performance attribute we solve for, which is the accountability around advertising campaigns, the notion that overnight reporting and guarantees are a paramount to that measurement and that industry taking off, I feel very confident that we're winning the day, and we continue to proceed forward. So -- anyway, I feel good about it. We continue to add campaigns. We continue to add clients, very much on course.","Operator","The next question comes from Sara Gubins at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian T. Davis - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Brian Davis in for Sara Gubins. I was wondering -- regarding the online segment, can you give us an update as to where you think you stand on video advertising versus display? Last quarter, you discussed making a lot of progress on the video front.","David L. Calhoun","Yes. Well, it's really a repeat of what I just said. I feel as though -- and not only feel but I believe, based on sort of wins and losses, that we are right where we need to be on video. And we have not yet launched, officially, the program ratings associated with that online tool. So we are in trial with all of the major media companies, certainly all the networks, basically building that program rating so that they can push it alongside of their TV rating. So my own view is that even without the program rating at this stage, we are winning the war on video ads. Program ratings will just help that because it gives the agencies a planning tool alongside of the campaign tool. So all things positive on video. I think, in display, it's still a crapshoot. That is of course -- in our view, it's a lesser value medium. It doesn't mean it's not important, it's just of lesser value. And so, it's going to take us longer to penetrate that end of it.","Brian T. Davis - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And just 1 follow-up. Regarding competitive dynamics online, can you just give us an update as to your progress there?","David L. Calhoun","Yes. Well, I think, again, I pretty much just summarized it. But I'll remind everybody that, in this space, captive metrics continue to rule the day. So these are publishers with their own metrics and their own tools. Basically, they get into the marketplace and, in effect, trying to sell their medium based on those captive metrics. Google, of course, does its thing. And then, you have these 2 independent metrics, which really is the comScore metric and the Nielsen metric. And so, net-net, as I've said now, probably 3 times, we believe we are winning, particularly in our intended areas of focus, and we're going to continue to march down this path. We have a terrific partner with Facebook and, we believe, a real leg up, and we're going to continue to build out the product because this product is far from complete. We've got a lot of things we can do and will do over the course of the next 12, 24 months.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Brian, could you talk a little bit more about free cash flow? Obviously, a strong quarter. Was there anything anomalous that made this quarter in particular a strong free cash flow quarter? And as you look for your operational guidance for the year, although you don't guide for free cash flow, should free cash flow generally track the EBITDA growth?","Brian J. West","So we're very confident with cash flow in the quarter. As I mentioned, it was a combination of the benefits that are right in front of all of us, which is the operating performance, the lower interest burden and then working capital improvements. So it all feels very good, and we focus on all of that all day long. And in terms of our free cash flow outlook, I think, as Dave mentioned, our decisions around capital allocation are really underwritten by our confidence in the cash flow generation of this company over time, both this year and going forward. So we feel very good, always expected it. And now we're happy that it is showing up in the results.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And there's nothing particularly anomalous that you know about free cash flow in the second half of the year?","Brian J. West","No. Nope, nope.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Salmon at BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'll give you my 2 questions at once. First, can you comment upon how much C7 ratings may have been used during the upfronts? And second, just on the Social TV product, just maybe clarify a little bit with SocialGuide, how many of those 50 clients came with that company versus that have been added subsequently as you guys start to get in there and working on the product?","David L. Calhoun","So second question first. I don't know the answer, but I would go so far as to guess it's way over 50%. Maybe -- it might be 85%. I don't -- so -- because when we bought SocialGuide, it was very small with a few very discrete clients. So we have been signing them up very regularly. If you need a really precise answer, I'd encourage you to call Kate. But if they -- it's the large majority. On C7, I really don't know the answer to that question. As you know, we -- C7 is a metric that we have and is available. It's just a question of whether buyers and sellers ultimately want to use it. So far, they've leaned heavily in favor of C3. So I don't want to project any outcomes or anything, and I don't really know the answer to just how many people discretely used it this time around.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Nollen at Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","You left, I think, a tantalizing hint when you mentioned that Ad Solutions was contributing to some of the margin expansion. Correct me if I didn't hear that correctly. But I wonder -- I know you've been reticent to give any guidance or indications of the size of both Ad Solutions and OCR and the growth, but I wonder if there's anything you can tell us about that or give us an idea when you could tell us because I think we all recognize they are enormous potential growth drivers for you. And then, secondly -- I'll ask my follow-up right now. Secondly, on Europe, I'm getting the sense from some of the ad companies that a lot of their advertiser clients are really thinking about shifting some of their resources permanently out of Europe, and that's not anything new. It's been going on for some time. But how is it that you are managing to win business there? Is it new products you're bringing in? Is it some new clients you're managing to win? How is it that you are able to keep Europe more or less flat?","David L. Calhoun","Yes. Thanks. I mean, this is just one of those classics, right, when -- just like in '08 and '09, when things are tough, stronger players usually emerge stronger. That's when share shifts occur in the process. Remember we have this big global map. We have lots of things to trade and bargain to work with our big global multinationals, so that we can help them with their European situation. And that's really what happens. So I think the strength of our global franchise, along with the strength of our Europe franchise, our ability to hang in tough during all these moments, that usually plays to some really good competitive dynamics that when you come out of it, you're advantaged. I don't think this is any different than what we have experienced historically, particularly in that '08-'09 time frame. And so, that's what I would say about Europe. And we've remained totally committed to Europe both in terms of investment and supporting our big clients. With respect to Ad Solutions -- I'll let Brian comment on sort of segment questions. But the margin rationale is pretty simple. It's a syndicated product plus a syndicated product, when you combine them, creating additional value for client. Ultimately, that means you get a pretty reasonable deal. That's why we have this great margin performance within that business. With respect to sizing and segment, I'll let Brian comment.","Brian J. West","Well, as we've said before, we hope to break it out in the not-so-distant future. But we remain committed to invest, and some of it is growing fast. It's a big deal to us, and stay tuned on more disclosure going forward. But we like what we've got, and we particularly like the growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","It's Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research here. I just want to ask a couple of bigger-picture questions. One of the sources of the data we use to assess the industry suggests that it's pretty tepid growth for marketing research in general, and you're growing faster than that. I'm curious a, do you generally agree with that state of the general industry? And therefore, that you've been gaining share of market or budgets? Or -- I'm curious to hear how you characterize that in general? And then, maybe relatedly, do you see an increased involvement of procurement teams in the process? And I'm talking now on the marketer side. Do you see an increased involvement of marketing procurement teams in working with you to design contracts that fit your relationships with them?","David L. Calhoun","Yes. Okay. So first, I'll answer the first question. So again, the term market research covers a lot of ground, mostly ground that we don't actually play in. So what distinguishes us from what would classically be referred to as a research company is they do mostly custom kinds of stuff, projects and so forth. That's really not what we do. We have 2 basically big marketing information services, subscription in nature, built around the notion of \"How am I doing?\" In the retail world, it's \"What's my market share every week?\" And in the Watch world, it's \"What's my audience every day?\" And so -- and those 2 things are way different than what most people would refer to as market research. And so, I would -- and so, like the market research industry, a lot of the Insight work that we do, which is a little closer to that mark of custom, has under -- in fact been under pressure. We do believe we're winning more than we're losing in that regard because of the strength of our company. But you wouldn't really characterize us as that. And in fact, most of the economics that you like really have nothing to do with what most people would call research. I think that explains what you might hear and discuss. On the subject of procurement, no, I mean, we're big enough in our clients' world. Remember, we do -- you measure our ongoing relationships with our clients in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. They are going to have procurement people at the table every step of the way, and they do. And I wouldn't suggest there's any change one way or the other. It just is what it is. We're big, and we continue to work with our clients.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. And 1 other question. I'm curious to hear your current take on the state of interest among your clients with respect to set top data as part of the overall viewing measurement solutions?","David L. Calhoun","Honestly -- so, again, I'll talk with different constituencies here. Advertisers would never talk to us about set top data unless it had some really wonderful discrete understanding of consumer behavior within that particular set top box audience. We do some of that work, but not a lot. There are other people who do that kind of work, including the folks who own the data at the set top box level. So that's a little different. We don't really get a lot of set top box questions. And in the media world, that crowd -- all they really want to know is, \"What's the best, the most robust measure of my broad audience, not necessarily my set top box-only audience?\" And so, if we ever thought we'd have a more accurate measure as a result of set top box, we'd be in there doing it all the time. We don't ever get that. And we know that that's actually not something that set top box data will help us with. So in effect, set top box data is around. It is used mostly for unique understandings of a unique audience base that is just set top box. I think that's where most of the value is. It's not insubstantial. It's just that it serves a different purpose than what Nielsen actually does for most of its clients, and we view it as perfectly complementary. So it's just not a -- I know that people like to talk about it as sort of a threat, blah, blah, blah. But I don't -- we don't think about it that way. We view it as a complement, and we continue to march down that course.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz at Northland Capital Markets.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","I just wanted to look at EBITDA margins a bit. So if you look at your, sort of, overall EBITDA margin, unadjusted, it's been flat to down the past 4 quarters. And I guess, the differential, if you look at adjusted versus your unadjusted, it's really the other income -- or, I'm sorry, the other items line, which has contributed about $20 million in the second -- or the first half of this year. So I'm just curious, if you look at that differential, when do you sort of see those 2 aligning themselves? And maybe more specifically, is there a contribution that we should expect from other items in the second half of the year, or is that -- should that sort of go away post the Expositions?","Brian J. West","Yes, sure. So let me take a shot at this one. So between EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, actually, the level of adjustment has come way down over time, and we're happy about that -- to create that clarity. The real things that stick out there is going to be transaction costs associated with the Arbitron deal and then some restructuring. So it's fewer things. They're smaller -- there'll be a couple of things that will always be in there around foreign exchange and stock-based comp, which is taken out of EBITDA but put back for earnings because it is noncash. So we actually feel pretty good about the trend, and we feel good about calling out very discrete things that are in there. And over time, that noise has gotten less and less and will continue to do so.","David L. Calhoun","And the underlying rate, we have 2 things going for us in pretty big positive ways. One, we got a mix thing that goes on regularly that helps us. Ad Solutions now is 1 more additive feature to that game. But the Information versus Insights game works for us, as well as, now, the Ad Solutions space. And then, secondly, our productivity -- underlying productivity is very, very healthy. We continue to switch off old legacy IT systems because of the investments we made in our early years. As I've said on this call many times, that switch-off rate will continue to improve over time. And so -- and then, what we do is we reinvest a portion -- a good-sized portion of what we gain from those 2 things in the developing market growth, and that is our productivity play. That's how we think about it. That's how we measure it. That's how we operate. So -- and that will continue.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. But does that -- I guess, just to, I mean, to get something a little more tangible there, does that mean that the EBITDA -- the unadjusted EBITDA margin should be better than flat to down going forward? Or is there something that's inherent in that growth we've seen in the last 4 quarters that should continue?","Brian J. West","Again, I think, when you work out all of the one-time smaller adjustments, you're going to get close to where those 2 get closer together. And where that heads over time is going to be continued margin expansion, but it's going to be margin expansion that's going to reflect the reinvestment that Dave mentioned. And we expect that our proposition, as always, is that it's going to grow. It's going to be how fast does it grow. And right now, we're very comfortable with all the reinvestments we make, growing at a pretty consistent rate. And I'd have you look back to see the last couple years and several quarters about what that looks like in our company.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Just 1 last quick one, if I could. The Insight pipeline implies what kind of second half growth? And if you could just specifically -- kind of looking at the last couple of years, we've seen -- in '11, you saw growth of about 3% in constant currency. Last year, it was down about 3%. So are you seeing something specifically in the second half that should tell you should see better than sort of cyclical-type growth in that segment?","Brian J. West","Well, it continues to be better. So this is our fourth quarter of sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in the Insights business. We see order books firming up. We see clients starting to reinvest, and we think that, that momentum will continue to the back half of the year.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","So what type of growth does that imply, though? Does it imply better than sort of that...","Brian J. West","We don't specifically call out a number in that space, but it's going to be better for sure.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Better than what you saw in the first half? Or just...","Brian J. West","Like I said, the sequential momentum has been terrific. It's gotten better and better every quarter, and it will continue to do so, in our expectation, in the back half, and that's all baked into our forward guide.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Kate Vanek for closing remarks.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thank you so much.

We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's first quarter financial performance. Joining me on today's call is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer, and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Feel free to join the queue again. And if time remains, we will call on you.","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call.","In the first quarter, we continued to execute on our key initiatives while focusing on our Path to 2020 objectives through continuous innovation. We're transforming our business in three major areas, Watch, Buy and Operations, to drive a faster growing, higher margin business and create incremental value for our shareholders.","I'll turn it over to Jamere to review the financials and then, I'll come back to cover five important topics.","Jamere?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Mitch.","Overall, we continue to deliver positive top line growth due to the strength of our portfolio across Watch and Buy, while our Buy business continues to operate in a challenging set of market conditions. Our teams are focused on execution, which means driving growth in Watch and the emerging markets in Buy, investing in key initiatives and driving efficiency and productivity across our entire business. Our results in the first quarter reflect these dynamics.","First, let me give a few more details on our total company performance in the first quarter. On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just over $1.6 billion, up 5.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in Buy. In addition, revenues were impacted by 310 basis points benefit in foreign exchange rates.","Net income was $72 million and net income per share was $0.20, flat with last year. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth in our Watch segment, offset by planned investments in our Buy segment growth initiatives, which will taper down throughout the year.","Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was up 2.4% on a constant currency basis. Revenue was also up 2.4% on an organic basis. Watch revenue grew 7.1%, partially offset by a 2.1% decline in Buy revenue. I will provide more color on the segments in just a few moments.","Adjusted EBITDA was $423 million, down 0.7% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 26.3%, down 83 basis points on a constant currency basis. In the quarter, we continued to fund investments that will improve growth and profitability in our business, consistent with the Path to 2020 that we laid out at Investor Day last November.","We remain on track for 60 basis points of margin compression in 2018 on a constant currency basis with improving trends in the second half as our Buy growth initiatives ramp. Finally, we had a free cash flow usage of $245 million. As a reminder, we typically deliver nearly all of our annual free cash flow in the second, third and fourth quarters. In this year's first quarter, we were impacted by typical seasonality as well as planned investments in retailer and other growth initiatives. We remain on track for our full-year free cash flow plan of approximately $800 million to fuel growth and return cash to our shareholders.","Our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend increase of nearly 3% to $0.35 a share. I also want to highlight that we have $278 million remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization, which we plan to exhaust over the next 12 months. This provides an additional lever to return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. This reflects our continued commitment to drive long-term incremental shareholder value and is consistent with the long-term free cash flow allocation framework that we laid out at our Investor Day last November.","Next, I'll move to the segments, starting with Watch. Our Watch segment, which is our largest by both revenue and EBITDA, had another great quarter. Revenue was $834 million, up 7.1% constant currency. On an organic basis, Watch revenue grew 6.2%.","Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 10.5% constant currency, helped by one month of the Gracenote acquisition and continued momentum in our Total Audience initiatives. On an organic basis, Audience Measurement of Video and Text grew 7%, led by strength in National TV and Digital. We continued to see momentum in Digital Ad Ratings with a 55% lift in campaigns in the quarter. Digital Content Ratings continued this momentum with a number of new wins with digital publishers and we're also measuring digital content on Amazon Prime Video channels.","Audio was up just under 1% in the quarter. Marketing Effectiveness was up 22.7% constant currency on continued strength in ROI solutions. On an organic basis, Marketing Effectiveness grew 17.3%. This adjusts for the Visual IQ acquisition and the exit of TV Brand Effect. Advertisers are intensely focused on measuring return on their investment and media spend and this is an important source of growth for our company.","Other Watch was down $16 million or 35.3% due to previously announced product exits. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $350 million, up 7.4% constant currency. Watch margins were 42%, up 12 basis points constant currency. Excluding the drag from unfavorable mix from Gracenote, Watch margins were up 85 basis points constant currency, driven by a strong top line and productivity improvements. Our Watch business is off to a great start to the year. Importantly, we continue to invest in our Watch business to drive solid revenue and EBITDA growth.","Turning to Buy, first quarter total Buy revenue was $776 million, down 2.1% constant currency. On an organic basis, Buy revenue declined 1.3%. Our revenue in the developed markets was $471 million, down 5.2% constant currency, driven by continued weakness in the U.S.","Emerging markets revenue was $294 million, up 6.1% constant currency. As expected, we saw improvement in the growth rate from 4Q, but we still have more to go here. Growth was broad-based across several markets, including Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and China. Last quarter we highlighted some challenges in China. However, as expected, we saw improvement here in the first quarter, and we expect more to come during the year.","Our Corporate Buy revenue was down $8 million or 42.1%, behind previously announced pruning actions. Buy-adjusted EBITDA was $84 million, down 24.3% constant currency in the first quarter. The quarterly results were driven by the launch of new retailer programs, most notably Walmart.","In addition, we continue to invest in our Connected System initiative to support the rollout this year. We expect these programs to positively impact revenue and margins in the second half of 2018. We also continue to restructure and right-size our Buy business in response to top line challenges in the developed markets. These efforts will improve margins and fund growth initiatives in the portfolio.","Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 310 basis point lift on revenue and 140 basis points pickup on EBITDA. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through 2018, then we expect 140 basis points pickup on revenue and a 50 basis points benefit on EBITDA for the full year.","Moving to 2018 guidance, we are increasing full-year EPS guidance to reflect the impact of U.S. tax reform. We now expect GAAP EPS to be $1.50 to $1.56 per share. This is a $0.10 increase versus our prior guidance and reflects our updated 34% GAAP tax forecast. We are maintaining the remaining elements of guidance, highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3% constant currency and free cash flow guidance of approximately $800 million.","We also now expect cash taxes to be neutral to slightly positive to free cash flow in 2018 versus our prior expectations. We feel great about our Path to 2020 program, as many of the initiatives are already ahead of schedule without a significant increase in investment.","To wrap up, our Watch business has great momentum and we continue to invest. We also saw improving results in emerging Buy markets. We are making solid progress on our growth initiatives with the Connected System and retailer program, however, continue to operate in a challenging U.S. Buy market.","We are laser-focused on the Buy transformation by executing on our growth initiatives, reducing our costs, and driving efficiency in the business, all in line with our Path to 2020. In addition, we remain committed to a capital structure that will enable us to grow and return cash to shareholders in 2018 in the form of dividends and buybacks.","Before I turn it back to Mitch, one housekeeping item, on January 1 we adopted ASU 2017-07, which requires that we reclassify a portion of our pension and post-employment expense, primarily the interest-related component, from SG&A expenses to below operating income as part of other income and expense. The new accounting presentation requires us to restate the prior periods so they are comparable. The new standard had a small impact on historical adjusted EBITDA, but does not have an impact on net income or earnings per share, and there's a reconciliation in our press release.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Jamere.","This quarter I'll focus my comments on five important topics. The first three are our multiyear transformations underway in Watch, Buy, and our Operations function. The remaining two are the 2018 upfronts and consumer data privacy.","Let's start with the transformations, beginning with Watch. This one is the furthest along of the three. As audiences have continued to fragment over the past several years, we've been investing and innovating to move beyond our historical focus on traditional TV to provide high-quality measurement across all viewing platforms and distribution channels in order to secure Nielsen's position as the currency that underpins a very large and growing advertising market now and in the future.","The primary focus of our effort is our Total Audience Measurement system, which has widened our competitive moat and further strengthened our leadership position. While our work is ongoing, we've been very successful so far with this transformation, as reflected in our strong financial results. Our ability to provide independent, comparable and de-duplicated measurement is pivotal to understanding the fragmenting media landscape. This is exactly what our clients need, and we're the only company that can do it.","In 2017, our Digital in TV Ratings metric was accredited, and it expanded the definition of the C3\/C7 currency by incorporating viewing of linear content on digital platforms. Adoption continues to grow. Amazon Prime Video channels, Verizon Fios, and Philo were some of the latest clients added.","I often get asked when Nielsen will become the digital currency. We're well on our way, evidenced by the widespread adoption of Digital Ad Ratings across leading advertisers, publishers, and agencies, and it continues to grow. With the recent addition of Publicis Media, Digital Ad Ratings is now being used by the top seven agency holding companies around the world, representing close to 100 individual agencies.","At our Investor Day in November, we talked about the next step in expanding the currency, which we'll do by enabling crediting of both linear and dynamic ads in the same program via a combination of our C3\/C7 and Digital Ad Ratings metrics. We'll be incorporating viewability, fraud direction, and duration weighting of video impressions into Digital Ad Ratings this summer. Our ability to do so has played a significant role in aligning the industry on how to move forward.","Combined with the broad client adoption of Digital Ad Ratings, these capabilities put digital on a level playing field with TV, enabling buyers and sellers to transact with the same level of confidence as they have with TV for many decades. The key takeaway here is that Nielsen measurement will be used as the currency for both linear and dynamic ads. This is true currency-grade cross-platform measurement, and we're the only company that can do this.","Next week at our Ad Ratings Summit, we're bringing together 50 clients, media publishers, platforms and agencies. Among other things, we'll share the results of a pilot test of the expanded currency that we did in partnership with the key client, A+E Networks. This is an important milestone. There is a tremendous amount of interest in this topic as our clients seek flexible solutions to support their ever-evolving business models.","While audience measurement is our first priority, we also continue to invest in audience analytics. In April, we began integrating Gracenote's Smart TV data with Nielsen's TV ratings data to provide deeper viewing analytics. This gives programmers and advertisers the ability to make real-time data-driven decisions to grow their audiences.","Turning to the second key topic, transforming our Buy segment, the focus of this transformation is to return our developed markets to growth by differentiating our services in the market while maintaining our strong position in emerging markets. Our strategy has three components, each of which builds on the other. They are the rollout of a Connected System, driving growth through retailer initiatives and Total Consumer Measurement.","Let me review these in a little more detail, starting with the Connected System, which integrates our core measurement data with the everyday analytics our clients need to make data-driven decisions with more speed and efficiency than ever before. Our rollout is progressing well. We remain on track to have 100 clients engaged with the end-to-end system by year-end 2018.","Our Connected Partner Program is up to 45 partners and our focus is now on driving increased usage of the partners' apps as well is our own apps that run on the same open platform. We're seeing good traction. We now have 219 clients using at least one component of the Connected System, up from 170 just two months ago.","The next key component focuses on driving growth through our partnerships with retailers, particularly Walmart. Since our February 1 launch of the Walmart One Version of Truth supplier collaboration program, we signed up more than 50 manufacturers, including Reckitt Benckiser, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition and Del Monte Foods. This program is off to a great start.","In March, we expanded our relationship with Sam's Club. This relationship is also anchored by a new supplier collaboration program that simplifies the way Sam's Club shares its first-party sales and inventory data with suppliers, aligning all of them around the same performance metrics and analytics for the first time. This expanded agreement further differentiates Nielsen and demonstrates our growing strength with retailers.","Finally, Total Consumer Measurement, this is a global coverage play, as we aim to comprehensively cover all the channels that matter to our clients. One example is our new total food offering, which provides a holistic view of the total store. This is extremely valuable to retailers because the perimeter of the store is an important area of growth and profit for them.","E-commerce is another key area for our clients and we continue to build out our coverage globally. We know it's not enough to only cover e-commerce. What's important is to align measurement of online sales with offline sales to provide a total view of the consumer and that is our objective. We're investing in solutions that will deliver deep granularity comparable to what we have in the offline world.","In emerging markets, our global footprint serves as a significant competitive advantage where, in many of our markets, we are the sole measurement provider. Our ongoing investments in coverage and penetration, combined with positive demographic trends in these markets, position us well for the long term. We continue to see faster growth with local clients in these markets, highlighting the importance of our balanced client portfolio.","To support our global Buy transformation, we have realigned our organization to simplify the structure and enable faster decision-making. John Tavolieri, who many of you met at our November Investor Day, now oversees our U.S. Buy business. John will also continue to lead operations and technology globally for us, just as he did before. Pat Dodd, who has been leading our business in 19 key growth markets around the world, now oversees our Buy business in all markets outside the U.S. This simplified structure aligns with the roadmap and goals we laid out in our Path to 2020.","And this dives to my third topic, the transformation of our Operations function. This is the newest of our three transformations. It's fueled by digitization, automation and consolidation, all supported by a growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're focused on driving increased efficiency all throughout our operations, contributing to four points of margin expansion by 2020.","In Watch operations, we're making great progress with the rollout of our new metering technology, the nano meter, which is already live in Sweden and in the testing phase in the U.S. We've put vBrand's video image recognition technology into production, helping us automate operations in our sports business and we'll apply this technology more broadly in our business over time.","In Buy operations, we're consolidating our local market operations into three global super hubs in Poland, Mexico and Malaysia. All three hubs are up and running and throughput is steadily growing. As we continue to push more deliverables through the super hubs, efficiency gains will grow. The most significant opportunity is the automation of our Buy data collection processes. We're making excellent progress and we're on track or ahead of plan with all of our initiatives in this area.","Let me highlight one market, Mexico. This market is an early mover in this program and their success serves as a great proof point for our strategy. They've seen revenue increase, data collection cost decrease and EBITDA growth accelerate and that's what this program is all about. We'll see these benefits accrue as our global rollout progresses.","To summarize the picture for our Buy segment, while the operating environment remains challenging in developed Buy, especially in the U.S., we're making real progress towards returning to growth and improving profitability despite the environment, in line with our Path to 2020 plan. Additionally, our Operations transformation for Buy is heavily focused on emerging markets.","Growth this quarter was below our plan for the year and we're focused on driving further improvement from first quarter levels. Over the long term, automations will drive not only significant margin improvement, but also revenue growth due to greater speed and quality as well as new capabilities.","Switching gears, let's turn to my fourth topic, the Upfronts and Newfronts. Around this time every year, there's a lot of activity in the marketplace as media companies look to differentiate themselves versus their competitors as they make their Upfront or Newfront pitches. And with that activity comes the discussion of new metrics or analytics capabilities that at first glance might seem to be a threat to Nielsen.","The reality is these are incremental growth opportunities for Nielsen. Clients are using our data to showcase the value of their audiences across platforms and business models. It demonstrates the great progress we've made with our Total Audience Measurement system and its key components, including Digital Ad Ratings, Digital Content Ratings, Digital in TV Ratings, out-of-home and subscription video-on-demand measurement.","A lot of the activity during the Upfronts and Newfronts draws from our Marketing Effectiveness capabilities. On track to be north of $400 million in revenue in 2018, this is where Watch and Buy come together, to deliver metrics that address advertising ROI and attribution. These are some of the most important topics for our clients these days, both buyers and sellers of media. This part of our business has consistently been growing double digits for quite some time.","With a small but growing portion of the market, focusing on advanced audience segments, we're also at the forefront of enabling audience-based buying. In March, we launched Advanced Audience Forecasting, a new tool that enables advertisers and media companies to better forecast inventory for audience segments across national TV networks. For example, an advertiser might use it to target pet owners or cereal buyers or people who shop at a particular type of store. And with our new Enterprise Audience API, media buyers and sellers can plug their systems directly into Nielsen to request data for specific audience segments on an on-demand basis. This includes transactions on the OpenAP platform for which we originally built the API.","Here's a recent comment from one of our clients, Simulmedia who said, with Nielsen's Enterprise Audience API, we'll be able to convert their gold standard data into targetable audience segments across all national TV networks in a matter of seconds. That sums it up well. We feel great about our position in this year's Upfronts.","My fifth and final topic is privacy and data protection. Consumer data privacy and data protection are at the cornerstone of all of Nielsen's solutions and this has been the case throughout our 95-year history. We embed privacy protections into the design of our products from the very start and our relationships with data providers, they're no exception.","In March, Facebook announced policy changes limiting the availability of third-party datasets for audience targeting on their platform. While access for some firms was curtailed, our relationship with Facebook remains strong. We still have access to the data that the industry needs for independent third-party measurement. We've always taken a conservative approach around consumer data privacy and this has proven to serve us well in the long term. Another key focus of the industry has been the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, a new EU data protection law going into effect on May 25.","We're ready for this. Because we've been at the forefront of privacy compliance for years, many of the steps required by GDPR were already in place. Overall, we see the greater focus on privacy, including GDPR, as a net positive for our position in the marketplace. Privacy is an important topic and the changes underway play to our strengths, ensuring compliance as regulation evolves will remain a high priority for us.","I hope I've addressed many of your questions head on, but I am sure you'll have more. So with that, I'll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Mitch. Carol, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Mitch. I appreciate slide number 14 that gives the status of the Nielsen transformation of Operations. I want to kind of ask you to look forward with us this year, what milestones and quantitative items should we be looking for during 2018 to judge if Nielsen is on track for the big margin unlock in 2019 and 2020? And what should be the timing of when EBITDA margins inflect upwards within the three-year plan?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah and, first, in terms of milestones, it depends on which part of the business we're looking at. So, within Buy, we're mostly focused there on consolidation of our operation centers into those super hubs and we'll keep you apprised in terms of the growth in the deliverables that are flowing through those super hubs.","Right now, the key thing is to note that they're all up and running and the throughput is growing. And by the end of the year, we have a target and we'll keep everybody updated on how we're progressing against that target in terms of percent of deliverables, but what we're happy to say right now is that we're ahead of schedule on that front.","On Buy data collection, John Tavolieri outlined five different initiatives at out Investor Day. We're expanding those capabilities to more markets around the world and we've provided those numbers in terms of what those targets are. And again, in these areas, we're either on track or ahead of schedule.","In Watch, it's mostly about the rollout of the nano meter, which, I mentioned in my prepared comments, has already live in Sweden. And we're in the testing phase in the U.S. There, the gating factor will be much more dependent on the MRC review of the nano meter and that's really the vehicle through which our clients have access to what those data look like and get a chance to weigh in. So, that one will be one that will probably take a little bit more time.","In terms of when you'll see the financial results start to flow through, we're going to have a little bit of that starting to show up in the second half of this year, but as we said at our Investor Day back in November, this will be back-half loaded more towards the second and the third year of our three-year plan and it will ramp up, I think, very handsomely as we progress into 2019, 2020.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Jamere, I was hoping you could talk about what happened with working capital this quarter. I think you mentioned seasonality, but looking at it year-over-year, it was still a little bit more use of cash from working capital. And so, what are you doing in the next quarters to just make sure that, that gets better and that you could hit your $800 million of free cash flow?","And just I wanted to sneak this in, Mitch, I hope you could talk about the Esports opportunity and just it's very new, but what's the business model there and how do you view the TAM? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Toni. So, there's no change to our free cash flow guidance. I'll remind you that Q1 is always our lowest quarter for cash and I'll remind you that we generate all of our free cash really in the second, third and fourth quarters.","In the first quarter, as I talked about, we had our typical seasonality, but the first quarter was also heavily weighted towards the investments that we're making with retailers and some of the growth initiatives that we talked about where the revenue and the EBITDA are going to ramp up in the back half of the year.","In terms of working capital, we're on track. We did see some catch-up early on in the quarter and we'll continue to progress towards the $800 million target for the year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Toni, on Esports, you sound like a fan, which is great. We first launched our Esports measurement capabilities last year and it got incredible coverage in the trade publications. It's a small portion of our sports business, but, yeah, there's a lot of interest in it and it's growing fast.","I think what it really is a testimony to is how important independent measurement is to development of different parts of the media marketplace. Esports, new, emerging, and to see the players in that part of the market welcome the entrance of Nielsen bringing our measurement into that market. They know what kind of positive impact that's likely to have on the economics of that marketplace as it continues to develop over time. So, to us, that's really the key takeaway with respect to the way the market reacted to our entrance into measurement for Esports.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Jamere, can you just kind of walk through the full-year guidance update again? And I guess what I'm wondering is, is this just \u2013 I guess I'm wondering is there a reinvestment of the tax reform savings as you seem to be hinting at last quarter? It was, I guess, the pension accounting previously contemplated in the guidance. I think that's a $10 million or $12 million headwind to EBITDA and then it washes at the EPS line. So just if you could, walk through some of the underlying factors to know if there's anything beyond I guess the lessening FX headwind and the incorporation of the tax reform.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","So just a couple things. From a guidance standpoint, what we highlighted this quarter is that we've updated our tax forecast to be 34% versus our previous guidance of 38% to 38.5%. That drove a $0.10 increase in EPS on a GAAP basis, and that's what we've actually reflected in our guidance there.","In terms of what we talked about on reinvestment, so we did talk about that in the last quarter. As we've completed our analysis and updated our GAAP tax guidance to 34% versus our previous estimate, the cash tax impact is actually neutral to slightly positive versus our previous expectations. And what you actually have there is the U.S. corporate headline tax rate of 21% is actually partially offset by the loss of some deductions.","So with limited cash tax benefits in 2018, we've maintained our original investment pace, but we feel great about our Path to 2020 program, as Mitch talked about, and many of the initiatives are already ahead of schedule without a significant increase in investment.","And then on your last point around pension, the new rules require that we actually restate last year and we've also updated our EBITDA forecast for this year. So you'll actually see that being reflected in our guide, and you can see the reconciliation of that in our press release.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mitch, you talked a little bit about measurement of Amazon channel a couple times during the prepared remarks. Could you just explain that a little bit more? Is that an expansion of your relationship with Amazon on the Watch side? Is it a change in the methodology of measuring, so that your media clients that are on that platform can take advantage of it? Said another way, is this a revenue opportunity, is it a methodology change, or is it both?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Dan. It's not a methodology change. No, this is about taking our existing metrics, in this case, Digital in TV Ratings, and also by the way Digital Content Ratings, and applying them to Amazon's business interests. So it's part of what we're doing with Amazon in our overall relationship with them.","So in video, it's about our Digital in TV Ratings and Digital Content Ratings metrics. In fast-moving consumer goods, we continue our work with Amazon as well, primarily through Whole Foods, with that relationship continuing to develop very well and growing. And going forward, we see a lot of opportunities to continue to build on our very dynamic relationship with Amazon. But in terms of what we're doing with them on video, that's our existing capabilities applied to their business needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Guys, I guess maybe one for Jamere and then one for Mitch, if I could. I guess, Jamere, just thinking about how we've started the year, obviously you guys gave guidance for the full year in terms of where you thought Watch would shake out, where you thought Buy would shake out. We started the year, it seems a little light on the Buy, a little strong on the Watch, which has obviously been a bit of a theme. Is the shape of the year starting out the way you would have thought? Any color just about how you're thinking about the shape of the year relative to what you would have thought three months ago? A little more meat on that bone would be helpful.","And then for Mitch, obviously, OpenAP obviously just brought on another important network partner to that initiative. And I apologize if I missed this, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the targeted audience, the OpenAP initiative as an incremental driver or not in 2018 and what's contemplated in guidance there? Thanks, guys.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great, I'll talk to the revenue. So we believe the guidance of approximately 3% is achievable, and our expectations haven't changed based on the first quarter. As we've talked about on the call, our Watch revenue growth is in line with our expectations, and we've got great momentum heading into the year.","It is fair to say that the Buy segment remains challenging, but our expectations haven't changed based on the first quarter results. We're making real progress. We remain optimistic that our growth initiatives, some of which have just recently launched, will actually build momentum in the second half of the year.","If I were to give a little bit more color on some of the sub-segments, our developed markets revenue is actually in line with our expectations. The U.S. is a bit lighter than what we saw in the back half of last year, but it's in line with our expectations. And again, it's fair to say that the environment is challenging, but the rest of the developed world continued to perform better than the U.S. We actually saw some growth shoots in Canada, the Pacific, and some the important markets in Western Europe. We continue to expect Europe to perform better than the U.S. due to the favorable product mix and the market dynamics.","And probably most importantly, as it relates to the developed markets is I'll remind you that our key growth initiatives will deliver revenue in the back half of the year. So we have more than 50 clients in the pipeline for the Walmart program, for example, that just recently launched and we're building momentum there, and we'll also continuing to make progress on incremental revenue opportunities in the Connected System and the Total Consumer Measurement initiatives.","As it relates to the emerging markets in Buy, the revenue improved from the fourth quarter, but quite frankly, we still have some work to go there. The emerging markets remain healthy. We have multinationals and locals that are continuing to invest the captured growth that's available in these markets. And that's going to be a dynamic that remains a tailwind for our business in 2018 and beyond.","We're continuing to drive coverage in earned price. We saw growth that was broad-based across several markets, including China. The results in China improved, as expected, versus what we saw last year in the fourth quarter. And again, multinationals and locals are investing in the emerging markets. And as you look at things like favorable demographics, rising incomes, and urbanization, that's driving FMC consumption and growth for our clients and they are investing.","And the last thing I'll say about the emerging markets is that we like the fact that local clients are continuing to grow at a very fast rate, similar to what we saw in 2017. So, from a revenue standpoint, we believe the guidance of approximately 3% is achievable and our expectations haven't changed based on what we've seen coming out of the first quarter.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","And then, Matt, to your question about OpenAP, this is one of a number of different capabilities out there to support audience-based buying in the marketplace. Audience-based buying is still a relatively small part of the market, but it's growing fast and it's all about selecting target audiences based on criteria that include age and gender, but usually go beyond age and gender.","Yeah, to your question about is this incremental for Nielsen, very much so, incremental growth opportunity for us. With regard to OpenAP, our data is being used in the vast majority of deals that are moving to OpenAP so far. We're really well positioned with respect to audience-based buying in general. We've been a leader in this area for past few years with our Nielsen Catalina Solutions, Nielsen Buyer Insights, our Nielsen Marketing Cloud capabilities and we're continuing to invest in this area.","Two other things I mentioned in my prepared comments are Advanced Audience Forecasting tool and our Enterprise Audience API. These are very much focused on audience-based buying. We timed the launches of those new capabilities to coincide with the Upfronts season when these are of heightened interest to our clients. So, that's the way we're thinking about this. Yeah, very much a growth opportunity. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Ryan Leonard filling in for Manav. Just want to revisit free cash flow if I can. I guess the implied ramp throughout the rest of the year is more than $1 billion, which would be a pretty impressive feat. And I guess, considering your comments that margin expansion won't really be outsized in the second half, can you maybe walk us through some the puts and takes that get you to the $800 million guidance?","And I guess on that note, accounts receivable factoring has become a bigger part of that number over the last couple years. I mean is there a way we should think about that for the rest of the year, so we can assess at the end of 2018 the true cash flow generation of the business?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yes. So, as I said a little bit earlier, there is no change to the free cash flow guidance for the year. Q1 is always our lowest quarter. We generate most of our cash flow or all of our cash flow really in the second, third and fourth quarters. And the big thing that's different this year versus some of the previous years is the retailer investments and the growth initiatives that we were contemplating in our forecast are all sort of front-half weighted.","So, that was part of our plan when we laid out sort of where the year was going to shake out and we're executing according to that plan and we're still on track for the $800 million. So, there is a big ramp that happens in the back half of the year, but that is the way that we had laid out the plan.","You mentioned a little bit around receivables. We, from time to time, do sell receivables in a quarter. It's part of our normal working capital management. You've seen us do that from time to time in different quarters. The plan there around that is really around making sure that we have the cash in the right places, given the global nature of our business and the fact that we have cash sweeps that we have to do at different places around the world.","So, it's not necessarily done as a boost to free cash flow. It's just part of our normal working capital management and it is contemplated in the $800 million of free cash flow guidance that we have for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I have another use of cash question actually. You've been a steady dividend payer and the purchaser of shares. Your leverage ratio is about 4 times and you have a rising rate environment now. I wonder if you have any updated thoughts on perhaps paying down debt, given some of the floating rates that you've got. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So, broadly in terms of capital allocation, we've maintained a balanced capital allocation approach that really starts with our leverage target. So, what we've said as part of our leverage target is that we're going to maintain our leverage in the 3 times area. Right now, we're at the high-end of that just based on some of the actions that we took last year to do a big tuck-in acquisition.","Naturally, based on the plan that we have laid out this year and as part of our three-year plan, we have the ability to de-lever somewhat over that time period. And given the strength of our balance sheet, given the fact that we're comfortable running the business in the 3 times area, this gives us plenty of financial firepower to grow our business and return cash to investors in a meaningful way.","So, we've said as part of our long-term free cash flow allocation policy that we would grow the dividend in line with earnings, that we would use roughly 40% of our free cash flow over the long term to flex between tuck-in M&A opportunities and share buybacks and the remainder to service the mandatory debt. So, if you combine what we're saying about leverage with sort of that free cash flow allocation framework, again we have all the flexibility that we need to return cash to investors in a meaningful way and grow our business and continue to keep leverage in that 3 times area.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jean Song - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Jean on for George. Given that Buy revenue growth came in on the lighter side this quarter, what provides the visibility that we'll see the sharp positive inflection in Buy margins over 2019-2020? And especially on the execution hiccups in China, what steps have been taken to address those and how far through 2018 do you expect the impact to last?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","So on Buy margins, again, I'll remind you that a big piece of the drag on the Buy margins in the front half of the year are the investments that we're making in the retailer programs and some of the growth initiatives. And so, those are front-half weighted and as those programs ramp up and drive revenue growth and margin in the back half, you'll see the margins start to improve.","We also expect, as Mitch mentioned a bit earlier, some of our Path to 2020 productivity initiatives to drive improved margins in the back half of the year. So, given the revenue framework that we've laid out, which is more back-half weighted, associated with some of the growth initiatives and the productivity initiatives, you should expect Buy margins to continue to improve in the back half of the year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah and what I'll add is we thought about the 2020 plan. We really put a lot of focus on having a significant number of elements in that plan that enable us to make progress, gross margin progress despite the environment. And in fact, our Operations transformation really has \u2013 it doesn't rely on revenue improvement at all, it drives a lot of the margin expansion simply based on increased efficiency in our business, largely through automation and consolidation.","Super hubs play a big role in that, our automation initiatives and our data collection processes in both Watch and Buy play a big role in that. So, a lot of this \u2013 the vast majority of this is in fact within our control.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","You asked a question on China as well. I'll let Mitch talk a little bit about some of the operating things that we talked about. We highlighted in the fourth quarter that we expected China to actually improve. We're actually seeing that in the business in the first quarter and we have a little bit more room to go there. We've made some changes in terms of leadership. We've made some changes in terms of our focus areas there and the business is on track and we're driving coverage opportunities and pricing opportunities there. Mitch, I don't know if you have anything else to add.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","The team is refocused on the core business. They're executing well. As Jamere mentioned, we've made some leadership changes and this is still the most important growth market in the world. We have not lost sight of that, I want to assure you, and it'll continue to be a really important growth contributor to our emerging markets and, in fact, our global Buy business for long into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I was curious about the pressures that your Buy segment clients are facing and maybe this ties a bit into working capital. Are you seeing any pressure in terms of payment terms as we see certainly in the agency space? And more generally, do you see efforts to renegotiate contracts from those clients at the present time?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, Brian, I think it's fair to say that every company that we're dealing with, either on the client side or on the supply chain side, is trying to figure out a way to better manage working capital and, in fact, they're trying to push for extended terms. It's certainly been the case with all of our global clients, but that's not a new phenomenon. I mean, that's something that we've always dealt with as part of contract renegotiations and we find the right place to land those contracts and land those negotiations. So, it is a play that is being pushed, but we've done a pretty good job just given the nature of our business.","The reality of our business as it relates to receivables and payables functions, if you will, is that the lion's share of our cost structure is actually in our people cost. So, we just don't have the same levers as some of the other elements of a manufacture, supply chain. And they understand that. It doesn't stop them from pushing on it, but we usually get to the right place in the discussions as it relates to payment terms.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Got it. So, no change there. And what about pricing pressure or attempts to renegotiate existing contracts?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, what I would say on that is from a pricing pressure standpoint, there's really no change in terms of the environment. I mean you've had clients continuing to look for opportunities to be more efficient in their contracts. I would say overall that the renewal dynamics are actually improving and one of the reasons we're seeing that at least in our business is that the capabilities that we're bringing to the marketplace and the capabilities that we're discussing in these renewals around the Connected System and some the retailer programs are actually positive developments that are helping us strengthen our product offering as we negotiate with both new and existing clients.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","In Connected System, Brian, also, as we said before, we'll keep saying, it is a big efficiency driver, not only for Nielsen, but probably even more importantly for our clients, because it automates so much of the activity for how the data that we deliver to our clients has been deployed and used within their organization both from the standpoint of measurement and the everyday analytics they use to make decisions in their business.","We are driving big-step changes in the efficiency for how data gets used inside of our clients and that is right on target in terms of what they're looking for right now, efficiency gains as opposed to just cutting budgets. This is a much more positive way for them to get to where they need to get to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Mitch, I'd love to get your thoughts, if I could, on a more structural question around Buy. Beyond what you can do on your own with the transformation that you've talked about, if you think about where you sit in a broader industry itself as a major player in the big business of supplying data analytics to the consumer goods and retail industry, I think it's fair to say that competitive situation ranges from highly fragmented to somewhat fragmented, depending on the product line.","So, I wonder if there's anything you can do, bigger picture, to perhaps either get much bigger through acquisition or partnership to perhaps bring some more capabilities to you, rationalize the industry a bit, make it healthier or go the other way, perhaps spin off some or all of your Buy segment into a place where it would exist in a healthier competitive situation for itself and for the good of Nielsen itself? Would love whatever thoughts you have on that. Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Todd. We talk about questions like this with our senior leadership team and our board regularly and I guess one thing I want to make sure everybody hears is we have very open mind as we think through these kinds of questions. And we're always focused on the object of creating value, value for our shareholders, value for all of our stakeholders out there.","In terms of Buy, getting better and having more scale leverage, we're very actively engaged in partnerships to be able to take advantage of scale opportunities. One of the things we talked about in fact, Todd, on last earnings call was what we're doing in the area of consumer-level data and that's a partnership we have with another firm with similar business needs as we do where we are partnering with them on building this receipt capture capability. It makes the economics of it a lot easier to justify when you can apply it across far more than just the fast-moving consumer goods industry. So, we are doing some things like that.","On the other side of the equation, when we think about Watch, Buy and the value that they bring to one another, I guess probably helpful if I remind you some the benefits of connecting Watch data with Buy data. It addresses one of the biggest questions that advertisers have these days, which is basically what is the ROI of my advertising? They have been asking that question for decades, but the reality is we're now able to answer that question in real-time, at scale and in a way that's incredibly useful to our clients as they look to optimize their advertising campaigns, their advertising allocations on the fly, to trim waste out of their budget, to drive up that ROI.","Because we have access to both the Buy data and the Watch data, we're in a terrific position to be able to help the marketplace with that long-term very important question. It's one of the reasons why you see our Marketing Effectiveness revenues growing consistently double digits over these past few years. And as I mentioned earlier, it will be north of $400 million in 2018.","So one other example of this is the Connected System. One of the key modules in the Connected System brings together the sales data with our media data and provides that on that platform to our clients, and it's one of the particular applications that's generated the most enthusiasm from our clients.","So there are a lot of reasons to have these things connected and a lot of value that gets generated as a result. And yet, at the same time, there are opportunities for us to pursue more scale and more efficiency by having our Buy business partner with other firms that have similar business interests.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I have just a question for Mr. Jackson on Watch. Given the imminent wave of media consolidation that seems to be going on with, I guess you were successful with Sinclair, but Discovery-Scripps, Disney-Fox, CBS-Viacom, how, if at all, do you anticipate that impact be in the Watch revenue trajectory over the next few years?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","We've seen very little impact associated with that. And to the extent that there is consolidation in the industry, if the footprint in terms of the number of networks remains about the same, then we would not expect to have a material impact on our business.","And what I'll also submit to you in this environment is that if you look at our Audience Measurement of Video and Text on an organic basis, our National TV and our Digital business are solid. The growth initiatives that we have in the marketplace are delivering, and these are the things that are actually driving our Watch business to perform very well on an organic basis.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, so you think number of networks is more salient than number of companies?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","That's exactly right.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","I would agree with that because our contracts with the big media companies generally are \u2013 there's a master service agreement across the entire relationship, but then the value of that contract is usually on a network-by-network basis. So if a company owns 5 networks or 10 networks, each of those has a fee related to the data and the services, the Total Audience Measurement services that we're providing to each of those individual networks inside of that overall media holding company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Surinder Singh Thind - Jefferies LLC","Hi, Mitch. I just wanted to follow up on the Facebook commentary and see if there was any additional color that you could provide. It sounded like the relationship is obviously very strong and still intact. But has there been any change in perhaps the level of data that you're able to get at this point in terms of segmentation that you have access to? Or alternatively, is there an opportunity to perhaps lock out competitors in the sense that you can establish a more exclusive, trusted relationship?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks for the question. As you mentioned, it is a very long-running and very strong relationship that we have with Facebook. We still have access to the data we need for our measurement products. For some of our products, the analytics products, we've had to make some process changes. We are in the process of making some process changes in order to accommodate some of their policy changes, but we're still able to deliver all those products to our clients in the marketplace, and we don't see any change in that going forward.","I think one of the reasons why we've weathered this period especially well, relatively well, better than I think a lot of the other data partners with Facebook is because we've always taken a more conservative approach with regard to consumer data protection, consumer data privacy. One thing we've said in the past in terms of how we use the data that we access from Facebook is that it's anonymized and aggregated before it's actually used in our services. And so there's a certain extra level of protection in terms of the data access we use and how it's deployed in our products.","So again, we're in a very good position. I think as we think about the implications of the Facebook situation and the implications of GDPR, we really think all of this plays as a net positive for our business and our position in the marketplace as it unfolds.","Operator","I'll turn the call back to Mitch Barns for closing remarks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Carol. And thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call. Let me just sum it up by saying we have these three really big and important transformations underway in our business. Watch is furthest along, obviously centered on Total Audience. The focus is on measuring it all, TV and digital, content and ads, linear and dynamic, and then providing the currency for all of it to both buyers and sellers in media.","We're investing to maintain and build on what is already a strong position and you see it in our results, especially the revenue growth for our Audience Measurement of Video and Text. In Buy, transformation there is progressing well and we have these three components to our strategy, each of which builds on the other. We're transforming our core products with the Connected System, we're investing in growth through our retailer initiatives, including Walmart and Sam's Club and others and we're continuing to expand our coverage of sales in a fragmenting retail environment through Total Consumer Measurement.","And our Operations transformation, this is the newest of three. Here, it's about driving increased efficiency and accelerated margin expansion through automation and consolidation. All of the components of our program are either on track or ahead of schedule.","Regarding the 2018 Upfronts, we're well positioned for incremental growth with a strong portfolio of both existing and new capabilities. And, finally, consumer data privacy, it's always been a high priority for us, both in the way we design our products and the way we run our operations. We're well prepared for GDPR and we're well positioned in the market.","So, thank you once again for joining us on the call this morning and we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming days and weeks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference and you may now disconnect."],"15581":["Nielsen N.V.

After the speakers remarks there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you and Ms. Kate Vanek, SVP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Kate Vanek","Aye good morning everybody and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen\u2019s first quarter 2015 financial performance. Joining me on today\u2019s call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, CEO; and Jamere Jackson, our CFO. A slide presentation that we\u2019ll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website at nielsen.com\\investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen\u2019s view as of today, April 22, 2015.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in Nielsen\u2019s 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find also on our website.","For Q&A as we did last quarter, we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question only so that we can accommodate everybody in the queue and we thank you in advance for that. Feel free to join the queue again and if time remains, we will certainly call on you.","For now to start the call I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CEO Mitch Barns.","Mitch Barns","Yes thank Kate. Good morning everyone thanks for joining us on the call. It\u2019s incredibly exciting time both for Nielsen and our clients. Pace of changes faster than ever, it starts with the relentless margin technology which is then driving this accelerating fragmentation in both media and retail worlds. That contributes to the growing of abundance of data which all of the players are waiting to put to use. Our mission to it all is to provide a clear and complete understanding of consumers and markets. Given the pace of change are priority [ph] that clarity more than ever. That\u2019s why when we look at everything happening around us, we say there\u2019s never been a better time to do what we do.","Let\u2019s take a look at the first quarter it was the great quarter, reflecting our solid business results and the progress we made in executing our strategy. First quarter revenues grew 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch revenues increased nearly 4% driven by strength in audience measurement and marketing effectiveness, partially offset by actions we took to prove our portfolio of some non-core products, as well as the expected ongoing runoff in our legacy online rankings product that will replaced by digital content ratings in the fall. Excluding these our Watch segment underpinned by our Total Audience Measurement strategy grew 5.8% on a constant currency basis.","Buy revenues were up 5% constant currency, and this includes 3% growth in developed markets and another quarter of double digit growth in emerging markets where the investments we made in expanding our coverage continue to pay off.","Next adjusted EBITDA was up approximately 7% constant currency, reflecting the scalability of our business model and the tremendous work by our teams around the globe who executed with discipline and delivered on productivity. Adjusted net income per share grew 18% constant currency to $0.46.","During the quarter, we also continued to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework, today we announced that our board has approved that dividend increase of 12%, increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share. We also continue to buyback our stock under our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which were on track to exhaust by mid-2016. Both of these actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value. Our resilient business model and strong free cash flow also enable us to pursue strategic acquisitions as we add to our capabilities in step of the evolving needs of our clients.","In March, we completed the acquisition of eXelate. This acquisition adds tremendous value to Nielsen in terms of capability. Actually thousands of behavioral and intend based audience segments, many which were built from Nielsen\u2019s data helps improve the precision of buying and selling decisions in the digital marketing and programmatic ecosystems.","Finally, so we do the changes in FX, since we last reported. We will be updating our 2015 guidance and Jamere talk more about this in a moment.","Next, I\u2019ll turn to our key strategic initiatives. Let\u2019s start with Watch. I first talk about our Total Audience Measurement and that remains our number one priority. We\u2019re sharply focused on first, providing our clients with the solutions they need for Total Audience Measurement. And second, guiding the industry towards redefining the currency, to capture more of the time consumer spend with video content across the growing variety of screens, devices and platforms they\u2019re using.","I want to spend a few minutes on those two topics. First, what is Total Audience Measurement? Total Audience Measurement is our framework for comprehensive measurement for our clients, following consumers wherever they go and however they view. Total Audience Measurement is itself not a product. Think of it as a framework that integrates our measurement capabilities both existing and the new capabilities that we continue to bring to the market as we follow the consumer, for instance, for a video, measuring the Total Audience means measuring live TV, time-shifted TV, over-the-top video on the TV screen, as well as video on a computer, tablet or smartphone. And here is another important point each of those measures needs to be comparable to the others so they can be combined to represent the Total Audience. This is what the market needs and Nielsen is uniquely positioned to deliver it.","On the second point, redefining the currency, let\u2019s revisit 2006 when C3 was adopted by the industries, as the current C. That process took about 12 months of negotiation, and collaboration between the agencies and the media companies before they reached agreement. The industry is going through with similar process now, except there\u2019s a new voice at the table, the Digital Voice, which adds another dimension to the discussion. We\u2019re in the early innings and we\u2019re doing all we can to help move this process along, but ultimately, it\u2019s the players in the market who determine the currency. What we can control is our own execution and we\u2019re moving rapidly to provide our clients with the solutions they need to see the Total Audience.","Meanwhile, we continue to renewal all of our major television audience measurement contracts. This business is rock solid, which is important because despite everything you may hear about the rising use of mobile devices, over 90% of the time spent watching premium video content is still on the TV, glass that includes live viewing and time-shifted viewing and viewing the content delivered to connected devices like Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, game consoles, and so on. That said, we follow the consumer, so when they use a computer or a mobile device to watch video, we\u2019ll also be there to measure it.","Next our video on-demand measurement, the capabilities are progressing nicely. In March we launched our newest measurement product, which uses the audio signature of a program to measure the audience. Any client who\u2019d like to measure the VOD viewing of their content on a television screen can simply provide us with the audio signature for the program and then we can measure it. So far we have 14 networks and studios signed up, and we expect those numbers to steadily increase. And in 2016 we\u2019ll add additional capability in this area.","On mobile measurement we are now working in the 49 broadcasting cable networks and 15 distributors including several MVPDs. These numbers are up shortly from just a few weeks ago when we were at 34 networks and eight distributors. In short we\u2019re gaining critical mass. We also made good progress on digital audio, where we\u2019re working with more than 30 players across the industry to implement our SDK in their apps and players.","We continue to see impressive growth in digital ad ratings, formerly called OCR. 20 of the top 25 advertisers have chosen Nielsen\u2019s measurements, and that's up from 18 of the top 25 that we sided in December. Renewals are strong, impressions are up, revenue nearly doubled in the quarter and we are on track to expand in the seven new international markets including China by the end of this year. This is a great product on its own. It will be even more valuable to our clients once our new Digital Content Ratings product goes out. Together these two measuring capabilities are important parts to the foundation of Total Audience Measurement.","Speaking of Digital Content Ratings our partnership with the Adobe is progressing very well. We\u2019re on schedule to launch our beta version this summer with the production launch targeted for September 30. In the meantime, we\u2019re already working with clients like Hulu and Sony Crackle to measure the audiences for their content. A place in the market see a lot of growth opportunity here, in fact in industry report published last week predicted it Web-TV advertising revenue could quadruple over the next five years, thanks to the arrival of Digital Content Ratings from Nielsen working with Adobe.","If that is an independent measurement, along with the precision and accountability to come with it will boost this market, as it has for so many other markets and this is great for Nielsen. A marketing effect in this practice has continued to see strong double digit growth in the quarter in fact it was north of 20%. In both Watch and Buy segments we expect measurement and analytics to continue to converge and that drives big improvements in the precision and optimization that needs a better return on investment in advertising. As the ROI of advertising increases, we expect that investment in advertising will also grow, and this too is great for Nielsen.","Let\u2019s now turn to the Buy business. Globally our Buy margins were up for the third straight quarter on a constant currency basis. This is as planned and there are longer-term trend lines which continue to be positive. In the develop markets our Buy business had a solid quarter with revenue growth of 3%, driven by our investments in our analytics products, as well as new client wins especially in the relatively faster drilling mid-tier and small client segments. Our Buy segment innovation practice had a strong quarter. This part of our business is focused on helping our FMCG clients with their new product launches. We forecast the sales potential and then we help them to optimize the launch. We\u2019ve been the global leader in this area for many years. New products are vital to this top line growth of our FMCG clients and we\u2019ve likely heard some of them talk more about this part of the business lately. This is encouraging for both our clients and for Nielsen.","In emerging markets, our business grew just about 10% for the third consecutive quarter. This is driven by growth with both our local clients and the multinationals. The growth was broad-based including Latin America with strong growth in our core measurement business. Southeast Asia with several new wins the Middle East with outstanding execution by our team there and a challenging environment and Greater China, where we continue to make incredible progress.","In fact let me say just a little bit more about China. You all have probably read that Chinese GDP growth in the first quarter was around 7% which is \u2013 it\u2019s been since 2009. Yet our growth in Mainland China was over 14%. We continue to make good progress with our e-commerce measurement, where we now cover over 70% of online FMCG sales in that market. We also expanded our relationship with our Alibaba by launching an automated new product testing capability, called New Offer Advisor on Alibaba\u2019s platform. Lastly, we\u2019re on track to launch Digital Ad Ratings in China in partnership with Tencent in early May. All in all, another great quarter of progress for Nielsen in China.","So as you can see, point 15 shaping upto the and extremely active and highly productive year for us. We still have a lot of work to do, but we feel great about the path we\u2019re on.","Over to you, Jamere.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch, and good morning everyone. Year is off to a good a start. We had good execution around the world with steady revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter. We are delivering on our capital allocation strategy by investing in assets to grow our business, executing on our share repurchase plan, and the Mitch, our Board of Directors approved the 12% quarterly dividend increase. Our business remains well positioned to deliver consistent growth of the cycles and our strong balance sheet and free cash generation capabilities enable us to grow our business, and return cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. Again a great start to the year.","First, I\u2019ll hit the total company results for the quarter. Revenue was just under $1.5 billion, up 4.4% constant currency with solid growth across both Watch and Buy. I\u2019ll highlight again that this marks the 31st [ph] consecutive quarter of constant currency revenue growth reflecting our remarkable consistency through the cycles.","Adjusted EBITDA was $380 million up 7.3% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 26.1% up 70 basis points on a constant currency basis, as we delivered strong productivity, while we continue to invest for long-term growth. Importantly we saw strong margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. Adjusted net income was $173 million, up 14.6% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.46, up 17.9% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. Our earnings growth was fueled by solid top line growth, strong operating leverage and our share repurchase plan as I will remind you is to execute $1 billion of share repurchases by mid-2016. In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares.","Finally, we had one million free cash flow uses in the quarter, down 14 million versus prior year due to timing on CapEx related to ratings enhancements which benefit both our local and national TV clients in the U.S. These are important commitments that we have made to our clients and we are executing.","Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. In the first quarter, our Watch business revenue was $660 million, up 3.6% constant currency. Now our revenue was dampened by a 220 basis points drag from actions we took to shed to non-core products, as well as the expected runoff of legacy online rankings products, which will be replaced by Digital Content Ratings in the fall. Excluding this impact, the Watch segment grew 5.8% constant currency. Audience measurement excluding Audio grew 5.5%, Audio grew right around 2% and Marketing Effectiveness grew 22.7%, building on the strong momentum we saw in the fourth quarter on increased demand for our Marketing ROI products. Well these three product lines which represent 93% of our business grew just shy of 6%. We also added the eXelate business in March and while the revenue contribution was small in 1Q, we are excited about the capabilities that we have to offer new and existing clients in this fast growing area of the industry.","Watch adjusted EBITDA was 278 million, up 6.1% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded nearly a four percentage point as we continue to drive productivity and operating leverage in the business. Our Watch segment has never been stronger. Over the past 18 months, every one of our national clients that has come up for renewal, has renewed their agreements with Nielsen and every major local client that has come up for renewal has also done so with Nielsen, including most recently narrative [ph]. This is the great business and we had another strong quarter.","Turning on to our Buy business, first quarter total Buy revenue was $798 million, up 5.1% on a constant currency basis, our business in the developed markets was $549 million, up 3% on a constant currency basis and our business in the emergency markets continues to deliver broad-based growth with revenue of $249 million, up 10.2% on a constant currency basis. In the developed markets, we continue to invest, resulting in growth in our subscription-based business, as well as good growth from client discretionary spending in areas like advanced analytics, segmentation and innovation.","Emerging markets continue to remain strong and in particular we saw double digit growth in Greater China, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Additionally, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe were all up mid-single digits. Our continued commitment to investing and coverage in analytics capability has delivered three straight quarters of double digit growth in the emerging markets.","Our EBITDA was a $110 million, up 8.9% constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were up 47 basis points in the quarter, as we improved profitability, while we continue to invest in emerging markets. Margin expansion in Buy has a big focus area for our teams and we\u2019ve started to see the benefits over the last three quarters. Overall we had a great quarter and Buy with solid revenue growth on a constant currency basis and strong margin expansion.","Next I\u2019ll move to foreign currency impacts. I want to remind you that we report revenue with EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don\u2019t pick on transactional risk so this slide focuses strictly on the translational impact for reporting purposes. And like many multinationals, we saw significant foreign currency impact that resulted in a 650 basis points drag on revenues and a 620 basis points drag on EBITDA during the quarter. The drive was about a 170 basis points greater on revenue and about 230 basis points greater on EBITDA than what we laid out on our 4Q earnings call, which is almost an incremental $0.02 impact on our earnings per share results in the first quarter. As yesterday\u2019s stock rates held constant through 2015 then we expect the 630 basis points drag on revenue and a 530 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2015. The currency impact represents $0.08 of share impact versus our February 12 update.","Turning now to 2015 guidance, we are updating our 2015 guidance to reflect the impact of foreign exchange rates as a result we now see adjusted net income per share in the $2.60 to $2.66 range, down from our previous range of $2.68 to $2.74 a share. This is $0.08 of share lower on the top and bottom end of the range and it\u2019s solely due to the impact of currency. On an operational basis, we remain confident in our plan to execute and deliver. All of the other metrics on the page remain unchanged versus our previous update, including our free cash flow guidance of $850 million to $900 million.","So to wrap up we are pleased with our execution in the first quarter, where we delivered steady consistent revenue growth and margin expansion. We are delivering on our commitments to grow our business with investments in key growth initiatives in both of our segments, as well as coverage [ph] expansion in the emerging markets.","Continued execution along with our plans to return over a $1 billion in cash back to shareholders in 2015 in the form of dividends and buybacks, gives us continued confidence that we have the elements in place to drive long-term shareholder value. And with that I will turn it back to Kate.","Kate Vanek","Operator, we\u2019d love the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from David Bank with RBC. Please go ahead.","David Bank","Start with \u2013 up to 30,000 feet that that\u2019s okay. As we kind of head into the upfront here, we\u2019ll find ourselves in middle of these debates about the future of video measurement and Nielsen\u2019s role and whether it should sort of center around the census spaces [ph] of set top box data, or panel base data and when we look at it, it seems like you solved that problem online by creating OCR, hybrid using Facebook data that kind of grows up the panel, right. So you use almost a census basis to gross up the online panel.","So where are we with that on the traditional TV side, why don\u2019t we have a version of OCR using set top box data? Is that the right answer? What would a cost, what would be a big incremental is that already sort of embedded in guidance that you\u2019ll do something like that and the way we think about long-term margin progression and it\u2019s the data actually for sale? Thank you.","Mitch Barns","Yes, thanks for the question David. We said back to our Analyst Day in December that the way we think about the future of measurement and this applies the Watch and the Buy side of our portfolio. The way we think about the future of measurement is that we will continue this on our high quality panels, which provide incredibly high level of quality and descriptiveness around consumers and also tapped into these growing numbers of big data set available to a single world, which provide granularity and they do it economically. We already do that in some parts of our portfolio, as you mentioned in the digital audience measurement. But the way we see the future of measurement across all parts of our portfolio is that this is the direction it\u2019ll go, it\u2019ll leverage our high quality panels and these big data sets in order to get the best of both worlds.","And yes, we do see that applying to television Audience Measurement in the future, as well. We\u2019ve been clear on that now for quite sometime and we\u2019re going to continue to head in that direction. The key obviously is the do it in a way that gives for visibility and comfort to the industry, as well.","You can use set-top box data for analytics, that\u2019s easier in fact we already do that, we do it quite productively in our portfolio in Nielsen Catalina Solutions, which is performing very well growing very well. It\u2019s a much more difficult proposition when it comes to measurement, but this goal doesn\u2019t scare it\u2019s way at all, we\u2019re still moving in that direction, we\u2019re looking to incorporate those powerful big data sets into our measurement portfolio including in television. And yes, you will see us continue to move that direction for the market. But we will do it with the market, with full visibility to them and with their full input, as well.","Again, we have access to all of these data already. We are always looking to increase our access to it and we will do that within the normal operating numbers so that we can see within our business.","Jamere, anything to add?","Jamere Jackson","Yes, you mentioned the upfront and one of the things that we\u2019ve seen as it relates to other data sets associated with the upfront is notion of marketing ROI products plan a more prominent role in the upfront. We have a couple of products there and our business in the first quarter was up 30% to 40% in areas like NCS and NDI. So right inline what David was suggesting and right in line with what we will expect to see at this time of the year.","David Bank","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. So I\u2019m just wondering about the quarter, where the product discontinuations and the declines in the legacy online rankings product included in the original guidance it just seem like the other component of Watch was furthermore negative than you had anticipated at the Analyst Day. So just wondering if that implies and Watch might be a little bit weaker than the original 4.5% to 6.5% constant currency range. Thank you.","Mitch Barns","So our Watch business is in great shape and this is the way that we plan the year and we expect sort of the year to be 4.5% of 6% business we laid of in December.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","Hi, I would like to take my one question and Jamere talk a little bit about capital structure if you would. Given the visibility and confidence you have in your continued revenue growth, the access to continued, relatively low cost borrowing and what I think of you is a low price of your stock, is there any reason you had, I mean, considering may be up in your leverage, borrowing some more money and buying back some more shares quicker, given all those elements come together. Thank you.","Jamere Jackson","So we do operate with our balance capital allocation approach. And if you recall last year we updated our leverage target to the three times area, we\u2019re conformable running business in this area. We think this gives us tremendous flexibility to both grow our business and return cash for the shareholders in a meaningful way. When we talked about our free cash flow allocation, we said that we would allocate roughly 45% to the dividend which we intend to grow inline with earnings. We said we toggled somewhere between, roughly 40% between buybacks and tuck-in M&A opportunities and the remainder to service a bit and so we\u2019re comfortable running in that area and we are executing a balance capital allocation approach that way and we expect to continue to run the business in the three times area going forward.","Mitch Barns","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. We like the question we talk about our sales on a regular basis. But we like where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go head.","Andrew Steinerman","Good morning guys. Jamere, I want to ask about how much was the buy discretionary revenue up year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis meaning taking out acquisitions from Harris and Afanova?","Jamere Jackson","Yes, so if you look at, Harris we did have a little bit of a Harris tough period there was about $8 million in revenue and then we have the Afanova business, which if you remember is a part of our innovation practice and will actually cannibalize some of our legacy basis business. So on an organic basis the Afanova business probably gave us about a point of list and then Harris $8 million on our Buy business is probably also another point.","Andrew Steinerman","Right. So how much was discretionary by organic?","Jamere Jackson","So our total Buy business was up $5 million in the quarter or 5% in the quarter, we had about two points from the acquisitions that we just talked about. And I would say our discretionary business was up in line with what we seen historically if you take those two things out.","Mitch Barns","I do want to reiterate Andrew we do continue to get new client wins. We mentioned relatively faster growing mid-tier and smaller client segments, we\u2019ve also continued to make some progress even with some of the bigger clients and some of the larger developed markets outside of Europe and the United States, most recently an example of that was Unilever in Australia and New Zealand who had been working with the other provider in those markets in fact for quite some time, recently decided to move their business back to Nielsen who couldn\u2019t be happier about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Thank you. Continuing on Buy, could you talk to us a bit about how Europe versus North America performed? And to the extended that you can break it out between the more stable formerly called the information business and the more discretionary spend that will be helpful. Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Yes sure, thank you Sara. So it\u2019s still relatively slower growth environment both in North America in our Buy business, as well as in Europe. One thing we did point to on discretionary side, is a little bit more sign of life within the new product innovation area, both within our portfolio and we see that picking up both at our clients, as well. One reason why we pointed out and it\u2019s noteworthy is at least historically, that\u2019s been kind of a lead indicator of a little bit more discretionary spend across our portfolio for our clients. I worked in this area of our business in the new product testing area innovation practices as we call it for more than half of my time at Nielsen so I know well I love it, and I recall that history, when you start to see a pickup how that often is the lead indicator for some of the other areas of discretionary spend.","Let me just add one other thing back to Europe. Again we\u2019re not changing our outlook for Europe, but there are in fact a few encouraging signs of life in terms of slightly better consumer confidence, so consumers are feeling a little bit better about their personal income, job security, may be showing a little bit more willingness to spend, off to a relatively low base, but we\u2019ve all been looking for early signs of life there in Europe and we\u2019re starting to see a few in pockets.","They haven\u2019t yet, translated into the numbers though, for our business and until that happens, we\u2019re not really going to change our outlook for that particular region of the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Ryan signing in for Manav. Can you just talk about kind of Nielsen\u2019s roll in those industry discussions around measurement you talked about? Obviously Megan has kind of pitched the idea of Total Audience in the public, but just kind of where does Nielsen sit in the negotiations between advertisers and kind of the video providers and have those talks started yet, or they just beginning or just a little bit of the timing around where we are with that?","Mitch Barns","Yes, hi Ryan thanks. Look, our first role obviously is to execute on our strategy, to deliver these capabilities that bring to life all of the elements of the Total Audience. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve been making great progress on every single front. Digital ad ratings continue to make progress on track with digital content ratings, our VOD Measurement, we upgraded with our launch of that new capability last month, and we have enhancement to our television audience measurement ratings both benefiting our local and our national TV clients as the year progresses. So executing is job number one for us.","Second though is of course having that data start to flow in particular for the mobile viewing for our clients, having to start to flow to their systems, having them start to see some incremental rating points, find their way into the currency, that\u2019s crucial. And then, the other big thing has to happen is redefining of the currency. And that\u2019s where some of the discussions are still in their early stages, but already underway. We\u2019re talking about that need for that to happen, there seems to be growing agreement that it certainly does. And then what are some of the options for, what it might be refined to \u2013 redefined to. And that will continue to progress and build consensus as the year progresses. And again our role is to foster that conversation, relate some real options out there, but ultimately any redefinition of the currency has to be made, that decision has to be made by the players in the industrial themselves.","So, yes, we will continue to update everybody on this as it progress, but those are the key sings that look for. We will continue to execute and data will increasingly start to flow where some of these new areas that consumers are moving to as they are finding their highly desired video content and then this discussion about redefining the currency. Those are the key signs that I\u2019d suggest that you look to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d like to follow-up on the mention you\u2019ve made of retiring of your legacy systems and some of the non-core products. I guess they don\u2019t really understand fully what that means. It feels like you\u2019ve done this before. So if you could explain it better what those things are that you are retiring. And the difference in Watch growth of 3.6% or 5.8% excluding those, I mean, should we expect this to be a recurring theme the next two quarters, or is this kind of a one-off shutdown and we will have a cleaner number going forward? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson","So let me add a little bit more clarity there. So first as I said, this is the way that we plan a year and we expect the total year to be a 4.5% to 6.5%. Now the other watch bucket was around $240 million, roughly half of that\u2019s either non-core businesses which we are approving and replacing with growth efforts like eXelate, or the legacy online rankings product which is being replaced by DCR when it launches in the fall. So this screening or sun setting of products is normal course of business for us inside Nielsen, and all-in-all we feel great about our total Watch growth for the fiscal year 4.5% to 6.5% which we provided in December.","Mitch Barns","Again, total Watch ads audience measurement which is growing very well, marketing effectiveness, which had a great quarter and then other. And there is a reason why it\u2019s called other. So it\u2019s from that other bucket that we pruned and that we have these legacy products that continue to rundown.","The pruning, let me give you one example of the pruning there. We have product that years ago came into our portfolio through an acquisition that was good to expect than, but no longer really fits with wherever going as a company, product called Flow Share and what it did was it looked at the market share and switching behavior of consumers in the telecomm world.","So when you would have your monthly mobile phone subscription, maybe it\u2019s with one company, you start to switch to another company Flow Share was a service that looked at that market share and switching activity. And well, it\u2019s just not aligned with where we\u2019re going from the strategy standpoint. So that was an example of a small part of our portfolio that we decided to prove. This is what good companies do. They don\u2019t just live with the portfolio you have, you always looking to bring great new capabilities in that are aligned with where you and your clients want to go, and you\u2019re always revaluating what\u2019s already there and asking yourself does that still make sense, is that still fair or is that more valuable at some other company. So that's what this one is about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Anjaneya Singh","Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can give us a bit more insight or talk a bit more about Nielsen audio, it seems to be two quarters of what\u2019s been anticipated growth wondering if the Q1 performance is in line with your expectations, if there any one off factors there that you can call out. And do you anticipate the progress in digital audio that you spoke to earlier provide to us \u2013 fiscal 2015? Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Yes, thanks. Look at this, its right in line with where we thought we would be on this more single-digit growth, we still have these other growth drivers that are going to be a little bit slower to build. Let me remind you what those other growth drivers are. First, it\u2019s about international expansion, and we said from the very start in this acquisition that these contracts were audio, Audience Measurement around the world always tend to come up every few years and so that\u2019s going to be a slower ramp. But we are already making progress on that front, we mentioned a couple of quarters to go about winning the Audience Measurement business in Turkey, that\u2019s one example. And we are always looking for more on the international front.","Second is bringing our analytics capabilities to the audio industry. In fact, our fitment from My Heart media was on, I believe it was CNBC just yesterday talking about exactly this question, where the radio industry has always had an opportunity to let a story more effectively about the return on investing in advertising on the radio platform and inside of Nielsen as helping in this issue to bring our analytic capabilities and showing what that return is, and in fact cited [ph] that is better than many people expected. So we\u2019ll continue to see a gradual build in our business with audio clients in our analytics capabilities.","And then lastly on digital, we mentioned that we now are working with more than 30 of the players in the marketplace with their Apps and with their audio players that work browsers. They implement our SDK, so that we can measure the audiences for their digital screening service. So that\u2019s a great sign of progress.","So what's going to happen in the audio world is very similar to what we referenced in the video world which is the digital players and the industrial players, as well as the media agencies that sit between need to come together and agree on how those audience metrics will be recorded as we bring together a terrestrial and digital parts of that market. And that still working progress, it is in fact progressing, but it is not across the line yet. So that\u2019s the summary of where we are. On audio we are right where we thought we would be, we feel very good about that progress and we look forward to seeing it continuing to unfold.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Bird with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bill Bird","Good morning, I was wondering if you talk about pricing for 2015, what does your pricing growth look like for each of Buy and Watch? And do you think you can sustain Watch pricing power given some of the headwinds that TV is experiencing. Thank you.","Jamere Jackson","Yes, so we said total company that, will get about 1.5 to 2 points of price and that\u2019s been consistent for the last several years and we look at where we are competitively at this point and we look at where we are with our client basically feel good about sustaining that that pricing power now and into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for taking the question. Another question on the pricing theme, I was wondering if you could talk about how you\u2019re thinking concepts about pricing the Digital Content Ratings product or alternately how you\u2019re thinking about those revenue generating potentials?","Jamere Jackson","Yes, thanks Brian. Well, it\u2019s going to probably play out somewhat differently depending on the client segment. For instance if you are one of the big media conglomerates and we already have a measurement contract relationship with you, then this product is going to be part of that portfolio where you\u2019re paying us to measure to you audience, no matter where, or how, or when they are consuming your content. And so it will be folded into that arrangement and may pay us fee for that measurement and we look that model, that model worked great for us historically.","If you are on the other hand digital first player, then our relationship with you might be at a different stage of development and might be more volume based. And now we\u2019re adding a new metric into that relationship where you might already be using digital add ratings where we are describing the size of the audience as you\u2019re ads that you\u2019re selling around your content. If you\u2019re an advertiser, the people are seeing ads for your brand. But if you\u2019re a digital first publisher, now you want to know, you want to have us measure the size of audiences but see the content, not just the add but the content as an additional metric and it\u2019ll probably follow the same path that digital ad ratings did once it was first launched into the market place for those kinds of client, the digital first players.","There are other segments as well, but I think those are the two key segments, the media conglomerates and digital first players.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Meuler","Yes, thank you. Mitch, what\u2019s your view on how the importance or the value of currency rating for video advertising changes and increasing the programatic world relative to that well?","Mitch Barns","Yes, thanks for the question. Well, it\u2019s interesting that when we launched Digital Ad Ratings that \u2013 the autumn of 2011 if I have it right. One of the segments in the marketplace, it\u2019s one of the earliest and strongest adopters of Digital Ad Ratings was the Ad\/Tech world, including the programmatic players. And I think the key reason for that is just because of the fundamental design of that product, it was really very well suited to that part of the market. And we\u2019ve continued to grow with them, as they\u2019ve continued to grow as a segment, so we feel really well positioned.","What is programmatic? It's at its essence automating a part of the process using an algorithm. People want that algorithm to be evaluated, in fact, they want it to be evaluated more than a person sometimes it\u2019s really important to have that discipline and that is what Digital Ad Rating brings to that part of that market. Now our metric works exceptionally well for those players.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on the competitive landscape, you\u2019ve had WPP Group make investments and rent track and come score recently and I just wanted to ask your thoughts on what that means for Nielsen in the measurement space and also the analytics space?","Mitch Barns","Thanks Bill. First, WEP is a big client of ours all around the world and we appreciate them as a client. We're going to continue to work with them that way. What we see then as the world's largest media agency is increasing their assets to data and technology, so that they can win more business and also run the businesses that they already have responsibility for better than ever. And we totally get that understand it and we help them do that every single day.","But it's important to see the distinction between what they're interested versus the core of our business. They are mostly about analytics, right, they want to use the data to drive the advertising services that they provided their clients and mostly in analytics application. That\u2019s separate from what measurement is all about, core measurement, where it\u2019s really fundamental to have independence. That\u2019s what the clients in the marketplace really require is independence, when it comes to the measurement that\u2019s used that the marketplace operates on.","So that\u2019s Nielsen's role in the marketplace is to provide that independent third-party measurement which is then also used not just as measurement, but also as fuel to drive a lot of those analytics that WBT and all of the other big media agencies, are increasingly relying on to run new businesses effectively.","That\u2019s the way we evaluate that Bill and then again there are big important client for us around the world. We look forward to continuing to work with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you. Good morning.","Mitch Barns","Good morning, Andre.","Andre Benjamin","I was wondering if you can provide an update on how the partnership with Google is going with regard to the Digital Ad Ratings product, how much of the growth that you cited is coming from that partnership versus the other way that people can use the product. Do you have a sense of many people are using VCE and any other update on whether users are opting inverse us out when they cite them?","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Andre going great. Google continues to be a very important growing client for us. And I think you might recall, few months ago we completed the integration of Digital Ad Ratings into the DoubleClick platform, that\u2019s working very well. We continue to work with Google in the direction of expanding the integration of Digital Ad Ratings into the DoubleClick platform to other markets around the world too. And so we are looking forward to making that happen and we expect that it will.","The DoubleClick platform largely focused on the display world, which is still very important. And so we are going to continue to stay focus on that, but, yes, as you mentioned as you referenced that is a more competitive part of the market. You think a video and then audio and then display advertising, we feel great about our position in video and our Total Audience Measurement strategy there, or like [ph] audio we\u2019re seeing great progress with the clients in that part of the market incorporating digital measurement. And then the text part of the world, where better display advertising are more prevalent, that\u2019s more of a dog fight. We are going to continue to work hard as we can that play as bigger world as we can there. And the DoubleClick platform, obviously, with the role place for the industry is an important area for us to do well. So we love the position we have on DoubleClick and with Google more generally.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Doug Arthur","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Jamere, you talked about the progress you are making on margins in the Buy segment. I guess the question is, is it a function of getting more operating leverage now that you\u2019re emerging market revenue growth constant currency is accelerating. Or you scaling back some of the investment? And so how do you see that playing out, say in 2016 in a constant currency basis. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson","So we continue to invest in a discipline way and expanding our coverage in the emerging markets. What you are starting to see as we said last year that some of those early investments are starting to scale. And as a result of that we are starting to see some margin expansion and this is a big focus area of our team as those businesses scale, we continue to drive cost out and productivity and you are going to see buy margins moving in the right direction. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress over the last three quarters. And as we look forward to 2016, we will continue to invest, but we expect the margin progress that we\u2019ve made particularly in emerging markets still continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisors. Please go ahead.","Tom Eagan","Thank you very much. I was hoping you could give us more detail about the Adobe partnership rollout. Specifically, what do you hope to accomplish by mid-2015 and end of year 2015. And then secondly what metrics where you use to gauge the success of that partnership? Thank you.","Mitch Barns","Thanks Tom. We\u2019re in the middle part of the years, when we are projecting to launch the beta version of this capability for Digital Content Ratings. That will give clients a first look at it and start to see some of the data, start to see how would fit into the systems that they use to run their business. And then what we\u2019re targeting for the full-scale commercial launch is that kind of 30, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll sort of turn the lights on and it will be operational if you will. And then we\u2019ll continue to see the business for that metric grow overtime.","Remember that we really aren\u2019t active in this particular space right now. You have Digital Ad Ratings out there that measures audience is correct and this metric Digital Content Ratings is about measuring audiences for content in the digital world. And the way clients like to use these two metrics is together. So the fact that we haven\u2019t yet launched Digital Content Ratings in the market really makes it that much more remarkable how well our Digital Ad Ratings product has done with clients.","20 of the top 25 advertisers, impressions are going rapidly, our revenue nearly doubled in the quarter, and we feel so good about it, we\u2019re really accelerating this international extension, as well. But once Digital Content Ratings comes out it kind of completes this system. Digital Ad Ratings will get that much stronger and more valuable because of the complementary nature of it with Digital Content Ratings. And it should really accelerate where we\u2019re going in this part of our portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO. Please go ahead.","Dan Salmon","Hi, good morning everyone. Mitch you talked a little bit about the eXelate acquisition in your prepared remarks and focused on their sort of original business around customer data segments into the programatic ecosystem and a lot of Nielsen data already being incorporated and that\u2019s bit more of the recent product launch would be the sort of ubiquitous term data management platform that we hear lot in that ecosystem, which can mean a lot of different things but to me really always includes the ability of mix and first party data from clients.","And so what I\u2019m curious is just hearing a little bit more about how you see the role of that product for Nielsen, you certainly don\u2019t think of the company as one that manages the first-party data on a regular basis. For advertisers that it would seem that your clients are likely asking for the ability to bring that in and mix it a little bit better with Nielsen products. And I\u2019d just like to hear from a high level, how that product within eXelate will help you with your clients going forward.","Mitch Barns","Great question, Dan you're spot on. We see two really great sources of value at least two from this acquisition. One is the business itself that we acquired in its current form. But then the second big source of value are the capabilities that reside inside of eXelate. And then how we line those up to what we see happening at our clients. And what that is, is our clients we see marketing, the activity of marketing in our client wanting to move through what we called the enterprise level, where it is much more system base, where the processors are much more connected, automated and the capabilities of eXelate see that desire, really, really well.","And then as you pointed out, a lot of these clients have a lot of their own first-party data. But a big challenge for them has been to connected usefully with data outside of their company and again that data management platform, DMP capability that eXelate is the prefect environment, which to do that. So you said of capabilities that eXelate has aligned perfectly with a lot of these changes we see happening in the marketing world where its wanting to move through the enterprise level, we are going to be able to help our clients do that better than ever, thanks to the capabilities that have coming to the Nielsen portfolios to our acquisition of eXelate. So, yes, we are really excited about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Ginocchio","Yes, I want to go back to the audience measurement pricing question that you said 1.5% to 2%, I would assume that it would have been a little bit higher because of the Digital Ad Ratings capabilities you are pushing through. Are you not getting any additional from those media conglomerates and can you remind us of the split between how you are going to regroup the investment of capture the opportunities in the Digital Ad Ratings between the media conglomerates and the digital first. Is it a 70\/30 split respectively? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson","So the 1.5, a few points that I talked about was the pricing that we get inside the total company and that mixes differently between Watch and Buy. Well, I\u2019ll say about pricing for Digital Ad Ratings in particular is, this is incremental pricing for us. So as Mitch talked about the discussions and the negotiations that we had with our exciting clients. Well, it is included as a part of our negotiation. This is how we justify the pricing increases that we have with those media clients. For the latest digital client, it\u2019s all incremental for us.","Now the good news is that, as we look at media fragmentation and the difficulty associated with finding those audiences, all of our clients know the technology that we built, they know the capabilities that we\u2019ve had. And these, quite frankly, have been pretty good pricing discussions for us. We have been able to get pricing and we also been able to get term associated with it as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. So my question is when Digital Content Ratings grows in what level of growth rate acceleration should we expect to see in the 4Q presumably by then the drag from legacy drawdown is gone and replaced by growth. And broadly speaking of remaining a measurement standard what is the alternative to your push towards Total Audience Measurement, how the different parts of the ecosystem thinking about this?","Mitch Barns","Okay, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. So just to clarify the 3.6% that we had in the first quarter is comparable for the 4.5% to 6.5% guidance that we gave for the full year. This is the way that we plan the year and if you remember we said Digital Content Ratings will show up in the back half of the year and that will begin to replace some of our legacy online ranking products. So you would expect us as that ramps up the digital legacy products will ramp down and you'll start to see some of that drag from the legacy products start to normalize.","The second piece to that is again, we've invested in eXelate, which is a faster growing business and that will also start to ramp up through the back half of the year. So that gives us confidence that we're at 3.6% in the first quarter, overall for the year we\u2019re going to be 4.5% to 6.5% just as we laid out and we\u2019re funding that guidance.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Kate Vanek","Sorry about that, Ashwin. That was a little awkward, but you know where to find us after the call to ask anything else that you need to. I just want to turn it back to our CEO, Mitch Barns for a few closing remarks and thank you all for tuning in today. Mitch?","Mitch Barns","Yes, thanks. Just a few closing comments, again a great quarter for us, solid financial performance, we\u2019re executing on all parts of our strategy, most notably our Total Audience Measurement strategy that all the feedback we get from the market says it\u2019s perfectly aligned with what our clients need, independent third-party measurement that brings comparable currency grade ratings to both Content and Ads across all these screen, devices and platforms that consumers are using today.","We\u2019re making progress on everyone of those fronts, Digital Ad Ratings, Digital Content Ratings, mobile measurement, we talked about the growth and the number of networks and distributors gain critical mass there. Our new VOD measurement capability that we launched last month and then still executing on good old television audience measurement with our rating enhancements plans there as well.","Our Marketing Effectiveness business had a great quarter double-digit growth in fact north of 20%. And again a third straight quarter of double-digit growth in emerging markets for the Buy side of our business. All that coupled with solid margin expansion in both Watch and Buy segments and then of course executing on our balanced approach to capital allocation, increasing our dividend that we announced this morning, we\u2019re continuing on our share buyback program, both of which deliver value back to our shareholders.","So with that, I\u2019ll just say once again thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking with you again in a few months, when we report on the second quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Financial Performance. Joining me on the call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. The slide presentation that we\u2019ll use on this call is available under the events section of our IR Web site at Nielsen.com\/investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations, and prospects, and are based on Nielsen\u2019s view as of today, February 11, 2016. We will be discussing non-GAAP measures during this morning\u2019s call for which we have provided reconciliations in the appendices of today\u2019s presentation, and will be posted on our Web site.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in Nielsen\u2019s 10-K and other filings and materials which you can also find on our Web site.

Feel free to join the queue again, if time remains, and we will recall you, and you know that you can always reach us immediately after the call.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Mitch Barns ","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. 2015 was a banner year for Nielsen. On a constant currency basis, we posted another year of mid-single-digit revenue growth, margin expansion and record free cash flow, despite the volatile economic backdrop. Steady, consistent and resilient, that\u2019s who we are. In 2015, our top priority and biggest accomplishment was total audience measurement, our comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement across all screens and platforms.","Today, total audience is here, it\u2019s in the market, and its gaining traction with our clients, and I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s execution. Looking at the business more broadly, leveraging our measurement and analytics to help our clients make the important connections that drive their business is what we've done for nearly 93 years. And in a world of growing complexity and speed, our platform-based system-oriented approach is nicely aligned with where our clients are going. It helped drive a number of wins across our watch and buy segments in 2015.","Let\u2019s take a quick look at our financial performance for the full year. First, we had strong revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, 2015 revenues grew 5%, 0.5 point better than our core revenue growth in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7.2% constant currency, reflecting the scalability of our business model and ongoing productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew 12.4% constant currency to $2.63. Free cash flow was a record $804 million, up 18% over the prior year. Our strong free cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, while also returning cash to our shareholders.","Through our dividend and share repurchases, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in 2015. In December, we announced an additional share buyback authorization of $500 million, bringing this to a total of approximately $850 million at year-end. Driving shareholder value through capital allocation remains a key priority for us. Acquisitions are also an integral part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, and the standout acquisition for us in 2015 was eXelate, which added to our ability to help buyers and sellers of advertising act with more precision and speed.","Importantly, we leveraged this acquisition to create an enterprise marketing platform, EMP. The system connects Nielsen data with a wide range of other data sources to help advertisers move from targeting segments of consumers to addressing individual consumers. It\u2019s a powerful capability.","Lastly, we are reiterating our guidance for 2016. Next, let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter highlights. First, watch. Fourth quarter watch revenues increased just over 5%. In addition to the growth from our traditional client base, we\u2019re also seeing faster growth with our digital clients, including the big players like Google and Facebook . By the way, we announced last month, that we'll be adding Facebook conversations to our existing Twitter feed to fuel our Nielsen social content ratings for TV programs, previously known as Nelson Twitter TV ratings. We also plan to add Instagram data in the near future. Our total audience measurement framework was a key driver of our performance in the quarter.","On our last call, we talked about the four phases we see as the industry moves toward adoption of the new currency, execute, evaluate, adopt, and transact. First, execute. We\u2019ve done this. The system is built, and it\u2019s available in the market. We brought more than two dozen deliverables to the marketplace in 2015 alone. Next, evaluate and adopt. These are iterative steps, and this is by design. Our clients need time to assess how the new metrics will impact their business. And they need flexibility, as they explore different ways to monetize their content, and we built that flexibility right into the system.","Let\u2019s look at some of the key components. First, digital ad ratings. Digital ad ratings is now in 17 countries, covering 85% of global digital ad spend. Revenue doubled in 2015. In January, we successfully completed our beta period on Google's DoubleClick platform. So we're now fully live with DoubleClick in eight countries, and ours is the only independent digital advertising metric available on the DoubleClick platform outside the US. We also continued to gain share with major advertisers, and the most recent is Mondelez, who has chosen Nielsen as its digital advertising measurement provider. Moving on to VOD, in 2015, we launched several new measurement solutions enabling us to cover a variety of video on demand viewing situations. If it's VOD or DVR viewing from your cable, satellite or telco provider, no matter whether it's seen within 3 days, 7 days, or up to 35 days of the original airing, we measure it. If it's VOD from one of the popular subscription based or ad supported VOD providers, we measure that too.","We're doing exactly that now for a wide range of networks and studios. We now cover over 6,000 different program episodes, most of which are viewed through Netflix. Altogether, our clients are using these various new metrics to drive both content licensing and advertising monetization decisions. Next, digital content ratings. Our progress with this roll out continued in Q4 and into this year. A diverse group of networks, MPDVs and publishers are already fully operational with another dozen or so currently in process. Notably, a major video digital platform will begin receiving data from us next week. As we said before, our approach to measuring each of the parts, in this case VOD, digital video and linear TV, is to ensure the measurement of each is comparable, so they can be put together to form total content ratings. The ability to provide this comprehensive view of the consumer is unique to Nielsen.","It's what enables us to provide our clients with a de-duplicated view of their total audience, putting television and digital video on an even playing field, which is crucial to how our clients think about their business going forward. We now have over 70 individual networks signed up for total content ratings, and as more clients enable measurement of their digital and VOD content, that number will continue to grow. We've also invested in our measurement of linear television viewing. In 2015, we effectively doubled the size of our gold standard US panel. The work is complete, and the ratings are live in the markets, and the larger panel provides greater rating stability, important especially for the smaller networks. It also adds more analytical power to our total audience measurement system.","In fact, all of these initiatives contribute to the growing adoption of Nielsen's total audience measurement system, which leads us to the fourth phase, transact. As we mentioned at our December Analyst Day, we've had successful meetings with a full range of key industry leaders, regarding the need to move the currency definition beyond the current C3 and C7. Additional meetings will occur over the next few weeks. Our clients are highly engaged, and there is broad based commitment to redefine the currency to one that's more reflective of how today's consumers watch content. We're confident that no matter how the currency is redefined, our total audience measurement system will support it. In the meantime, we know it's already helped shape how our clients are approaching and thinking about the 2016 up fronts. Before I leave watch, and turn to buy, I want to touch on marketing effectiveness business. We had another strong quarter, with revenue up more than 30%, as we continued to help both buyers and sellers of media drive the better marketing ROI. We strengthened our position in this area during the fourth quarter by increasing our stake in Nielsen Catalina Solutions, a business that's perfectly aligned with our strategy.","Turning to buy, as we closed 2015, our buy business continued to strengthen and expand. Revenues grew nearly 6% in the quarter, led by emerging markets, as well as a solid growth in key developed markets including the US and Europe. We continued to win new clients in the relatively faster growing mid tier and small client segments. Just last week, Dole Foods named Nielsen as their preferred provider of consumer information and analytics. We also continued to strengthen our positions with retailers around the world. Retailers are long time data partners for Nielsen but they also have a growing need for our analytics to help with their advertising, marketing, and merchandising decisions, both online and offline. Our business with retailers saw strong growth in 2015, boosted in part by 40 new ecommerce clients worldwide.","Emerging markets grew 8.4% in Q4, despite more challenging economic conditions in many key markets. You've heard us say before, that when our teams execute well, they are able to find growth even when GDP growth slows, because we're still gaining penetration in many emerging markets, and our results illustrate this. For example, in three key markets, Brazil, Russia and Turkey, our business grew double digits, well above the GDP growth in those markets. The secret here really isn't any secret, it comes down to good old fashioned execution by our teams, taking our proven product portfolio to new clients, while helping our existing clients manage through the changing market conditions. Our teams did a great job. Developed markets also exited the year with good momentum. Revenues increased 4.8% in Q4. And notably this was helped by Europe, where we're starting to see growth at the region level, low single-digits, but growth and we're happy to have it.","In parallel with total audience on the watch side, our buy business is building its own version called total consumer measurement. The idea is to measure all consumer purchases, as buying behavior continues to fragment across channels and segments. As millennials carve the path for a new way to buy, for instance, e-commerce, mobile devices and subscription models, we too, are carving out new ways to measure the full range of consumer purchasing, following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data, to provide the quality, granularity and efficiency that our clients require. Measurement is the core of our business, and our objective is full coverage, total audience in watch, total consumer in buy. We don't measure just one screen or one channel of distribution. Our objective is to measure all of them, and we do that by focusing on, and following the consumer.","Before I close, let me revisit the three major trends, and the related key investments that will drive our growth in 2016 and beyond. The first is the well-known trend that audiences are fragmenting across screens and platforms. And for us, that means our measurement needs to cover all viewing environments, providing comparable metrics for each. Our total audience measurement system does exactly that, and its adoption continues to grow among our clients. The second is, the consumers are reacting to ads and brands differently, and they're buying in new ways, and across new channels. Advertisers want to harness the power of big data to enable them to market to those changing consumers with greater precision, and with proven ROI on their marketing spend. This is what our enterprise marketing platform enables. ","The third trend is that our client's information and analytics needs are growing and changing. Clients want data and systems that help them to act, and they want more efficiency, speed and precision. This is the basis for our investment in eXelate and the enterprise marketing platform that I just talked about. But it's also the basis for our investment in our buy platform, the connected buy system that you heard us talk about at our Analyst Day in December. Clients want to know what consumers are buying, why they're buying it, and what action they should take next. In all three key areas, our platform-oriented, system-based approach provides scalability, flexibility, and speed, especially when our systems connect directly to our clients systems. And because we own the essential core data, no one is better positioned to do it than Nielsen.","To sum up, we feel great about our progress, and confident about the year ahead. While we certainly don't wish for difficult economic conditions, we're ready for them. In fact, we know from experience that when economic conditions grow more challenging, our business model's advantages and strengths show through more clearly. Over to you, Jamere.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. It was a great year for Nielsen, and I am especially proud of the contributions of my colleagues around the world. Our teams have had a laser-focus on execution, and our efforts are reflected in our fourth quarter and 2015 results. Our results are also indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model, and our ability to deliver solid results through the cycles. First, let me give a few more details on our 2015 performance. Revenue was just under 6.2 billion, up 5% constant currency, which is slightly above the high end of the revenue range we gave. We have delivered 38 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, behind solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our watch business grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis, and we enter 2016 with great momentum behind our total audience execution. Our buy business grew 5%, as our investments in the emerging markets and new client wins continue to deliver solid growth.","Adjusted EBITDA was just under 1.9 billion, up 7.2% at constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.1%, up 61 basis points on a constant currency basis, as we executed on our productivity initiatives, and delivered margin expansion in both our watch and buy segments. Adjusted net income was 975 million, up 8.5% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $2.63, up 12.4% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings, and execution of our share buyback program. We've generated record free cash flow of 804 million, up 18.1% versus a year ago. Our free cash flow conversion of adjusted net income was 82%, up 12 points versus a year ago, driven by EBITDA growth and working capital management. And as I look ahead, I continue to see opportunities for working capital efficiencies within our business that will continue to drive our free cash flow growth. And finally, we delivered a record 1.1 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2015, demonstrating our continued commitment to drive incremental shareholder value in capital allocations. Again, a great year and solid execution by our teams around the world.","Let me move to the fourth quarter. Revenue was 1.6 billion, up 5.6% at constant currency. We had a strong finish to the year, with solid revenue growth in both watch and buy. Adjusted EBITDA was 531 million, up 7.1% at constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.7%, up 45 basis points on a constant currency basis, as we delivered margin expansion in both our watch and buy segments for the sixth consecutive quarter. Adjusted net income was 300 million, up 3.1% at constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.82, up 7.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Finally, we generated $306 million in free cash flow, up an impressive 16.3% versus a year ago.","However, our cash flow performance was significantly impacted in the quarter by the severe flooding in one of our major collection centers in Chennai, India, as well as currency impacts from the stronger dollar. Despite this, we finished with our second highest quarterly free cash flow performance ever. As Mitch said, we finished the year on a strong note, and we have tremendous momentum heading into 2016. Next I\u2019ll move to the segments. First is our watch segment. Our watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $745 million, up 5.2% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well, as audience measurement ex-audio, which we now refer to as audience measurement of video and text was up 7.6%. As we talked about last quarter, audio was down 6.9%, as the timing of some deliveries were realized in the third quarter, which did not repeat in the fourth quarter.","And for those of you who have followed us since we acquired Arbitron, you will recall that our deliveries do not always sync up with the quarterly calendar, causing audio results to appear lumpy. But in 2015, the highly profitable audio business delivered low-single-digit revenue growth, outstanding margins, and strong free cash flow. Marketing and effectiveness was up 31.3% behind strong quarters in the eXelate product offerings, and the performance of the Nielsen Catalina Solutions or NCS joint venture, which we increased our ownership stake in, in fourth quarter as I mentioned at Analyst Day.","We\u2019ll also point out, that you will see in our filings and GAAP net income walk that we realized a $158 million non-operating gain on the step-up in our basis in NCS, as a result of our non-majority stake in the joint venture. Our majority ownership stake contributed about 1 point to our watch revenue growth in fourth quarter. In 2015, marketing effectiveness was up 21%, as we transformed the portfolio by making investments in eXelate and NCS, while meeting the market\u2019s growing demand for solutions that help publishers and advertisers better identify, acquire, and retain audiences across all screens, devices and formats.","As expected, and as we highlighted in our last quarterly call, we had nearly a 2 points drag on watch revenue from the products in our other watch bucket. We divested the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. And you should also note in our filings and GAAP income walk that we realized an $18 million non-operating gain on the transaction. Our growth initiatives are delivering. Digital ad ratings continued its momentum, reflecting strong demand from advertisers, agencies and media owners.","Digital ad ratings is an important offering in our total audience measurement framework. And in 2015, our revenue nearly doubled, as we added new clients, and existing clients increased the number of campaigns versus a year ago. Our subscription video-on-demand and digital Content ratings products continued to gain traction with our clients, giving us tremendous confidence and momentum heading into 2016. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $343 million, up 6.9% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded a strong 70 basis points on a constant currency basis, as we continued to drive operating leverage in the business. Our watch segment remains strong. We have executed on total audience measurement, invested to transform the portfolio, and our new products and initiatives are gaining momentum.","Turning to buy, our business had a strong fourth quarter and a solid year in 2015. Fourth quarter total buy revenue was $879 million, up 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $607 million, up 4.8% on a constant currency basis behind relative strength in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we saw some one-time discretionary spend pick up that led to a really strong quarter and finish to the year. Our business in the emerging markets was $272 million, up 8.4% on a constant currency basis.","Our teams are executing against a tough backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions. We saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Latin America, the Middle East, and Greater China, along with high-single-digits in Africa. Emerging market revenue grew 8.5% in 2015, and I\u2019m very pleased with our team\u2019s execution in these markets. Buy EBITDA was $195 million, up 7.1% constant currency. Our buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 25 basis points in the quarter.","This is the sixth straight quarter of buy margin expansion as we have worked to improve profitability, while we continue to invest in our products and expand coverage in the emerging markets. Overall, we had a great quarter in buy, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis. Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue in EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don\u2019t take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes.","In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 620 basis points drag on revenue, and a 580 basis points drag on EBITDA, which represented a $0.02 a share earnings headwind, versus our third quarter earnings call. For 2015, foreign currency impacted our adjusted net income per share results by $0.21. If yesterday\u2019s stock rates held constant through 2016, then we expect a 210 basis points drag on revenue, and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year of 2016, which represents an incremental $0.02 a share drag on the adjusted net income per share guidance that we gave in December. Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our 2016 and per share guidance, despite an additional $0.02 a share headwind from FX.","We remain confident in our plan to execute and deliver on all the operational elements that we laid out in December. So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter and 2015. We have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments as we head into 2016. And in addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure that will enable us to grow our business, and return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. And with that, I'll turn it back to Kate.","Kate Vanek","Great. Thank you. We'll now turn to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks so much. Good morning. Audience measurement growth was really strong this quarter, even with audio down more than expected. Could you just give us some additional color on what drove the core growth? Was it digital ad ratings, or was it something else? And if you could give us your updated thoughts on the total addressable market for digital, that would be really great? Thank you.","Mitch Barns ","Well, I will start, and then Jamere you can add. Toni, one thing I mentioned is that we're not only seeing the normal strong growth that we have with our traditional clients, but also we've seen accelerated growth with some of the digital clients that we're working with, pretty broad range of them in the market place. I mentioned Google and Facebook, but there is a number of others. One of the areas that has long been a strength, a strong grower for us in this area, is our work with the ad tech world, the ad exchanges, the ad platforms where our digital ad ratings metric in particular has played very well. And also as we bring eXelate into the picture, it just raises our game in that area, and so that's contributed. Jamere?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So as we mentioned, the core of our business remains very strong. And if you look at audience measurement in the quarter, which we are now calling audience measurement of video and text, it was up 7.6%. Now recall in the third quarter, we guided to a number that was in the 4% to 4.5% range. We came in a little hotter than that in the quarter, and the difference there are two things. One, the NCS joint venture, the majority stake closed a little bit sooner than we had anticipated, and NRG closed a little bit later than we anticipated, and as a result of that we were up about a point. And then I think your last question was on just to finish up, your last question was on the total opportunity as it relates to digital. Back a couple of years ago, we said that this was potentially a $500 million market opportunity. We still see that as being the case. And we're in the early innings of that obviously, but we are very confident in the products that we have in the marketplace, and in the adoption that we're seeing from our clients.","Kate Vanek ","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Yes, thanks. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on US and Europe, parts of the buy segment? I know you said new client wins, and you talked a little bit about that, but what's resonating with clients, and how much of that is a macro, indication of the activity there? And I guess, in the context of what you see or hear from them as you come into 2016 here?","Jamere Jackson","Yes, this is Jamere. So a couple of things, one, we see the discretionary spend environment as being pretty stable. We see our clients investing in analytics and innovation to help them drive top line growth. And you've seen from a number of CPG clients, as they've come out of a restructuring cycle, that they're pivoting to growth by investing in innovation. So the US for us was up low single digits in the fourth quarter, but up mid single digits for 2015. And in Western Europe, we saw our business being up mid single digits, behind strong results from new client wins and innovation. So we feel very good about where we are in the cycle, and our clients are starting to see some growth.","Mitch Barns","I'll just add that we have mentioned some of these client wins. We don't mention them all. We have a lot more that than what we mentioned. We don't always get the full support of our clients to broadcast these on these calls, but some that we have mentioned in previous calls [Indiscernible] are now known as RB & Cody, would obviously play into it, and on this call we mentioned Dole Foods earlier. Retailers is another thing I would call out. We've increased our focus on retailers over the past year. This is a global opportunity for our business, but in particular, an important opportunity for us in developed markets, where retail environments are a little more consolidated. And so, their profile in the market is raised.And what we find is while retailers have long been data partners for Nielsen, and they've also long been clients of our capabilities, both measurement and analytics, their need for the analytics capabilities we have has been growing in recent years, to help them with their pricing and their merchandising.","And now more recently were seeing their needs for our watch asset, to help them with their advertising decisions, growing as well. And they are big advertisers as you well know. And so, retailers have been an important part of our buy business growth, and in particular in developed markets, and we see very strong opportunity for our business with retailers going forward. And in fact, if we were to size it going forward, we would say that they represent as much as a 0.5 point of growth for our business over the next three to five years, 0.5 point per year over the next three to five years at a global level. That's how significant the opportunity we see with retailers is.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Dan Salmon","Good morning, everyone. Mitch, you mentioned before that the strength in the watch side was being helped by DARs, deeper penetration into the ad tech, and the programmatic marketplace. I'm curious, how much is eXelate helping open up those conversations for you? And would you consider those -- most of those clients to fall in the small and medium-sized client bucket? And then separate but relatedly, is eXelate helping you open up conversations with larger clients as well, that could be in the ad tech space? I know you've mentioned publicly, that Google being a growing client of yours. But maybe even in other parts of the business, where eXelate is opening up large client conversations?","Mitch Barns","That's a great question. I think what's implied by your question is, exactly what our experience has been that, the big clients, the small clients -- this is an ecosystem that is as connected as any other that we work in, across our business, around the world, and eXelate has helped us on every front. First, credibility, they have amazing talent, they have a proven, very strong capabilities. Those now being part of Nielsen portfolio gives us more credibility in this area, than we otherwise would of had, had we just continued down the path that we were on. We also bring a lot to the party, but connecting what Nielsen has historically had, and has been developing in recent years with eXelate, what they bring into our portfolio, has just accelerated our progress with both the small and with the larger players, because again, they are all connected at some level. And it's not just coincidence that Google has emerged over the last year or so to be one of our largest watch clients in the world. And so, yes, it really speaks to what underlies your question. So again, we feel great about the eXelate acquisition. The business itself that we acquired performed incredibly well in 2015. But even beyond that business, at P&L, it's the assets and the talent that came into Nielsen that are contributing all across our portfolio, that we're also seeing big value from that. Jamere, you have something to add?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. The thing that really stands out to us, and the reason that we're so excited about the acquisition, is that every client that we work with, on both the watch and the buy side of our business is looking for accurate data to target the right audience. And we have these relationships with over 200 online data providers, and we're working with over 125 media platforms. So we're in all right conversations, and we have an opportunity to address both large and small clients, just based on the footprint and capabilities inside this business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. ","Jeff Meuler","Yes, thank you. I know you guys in the past have highlighted some video audience measurement clients that are not ad supported. Could you just talk a bit more about how they use Nielsen data? And then, do they pay you similar rates for rating their content, as non ad supported clients, for as ad supported clients?","Mitch Barns","Well, what we're doing in this area, with respect to measurement of VOD, both ad supported and subscription-based, is really serving the entire market. Whether it's one of those platforms who is the source of that video content, or whether it's a network or studio who might be licensing that content to that same platform. So we've made these VOD measurement capabilities available, both VOD viewed through the cable or telco or satellite providers set-top-box, as well as VOD viewed over-the-top, if you will, through a connected device. And we're measuring all of those, different ways that consumers watch this content. I mentioned earlier, we're now covering more than 6,000 different program episodes in the marketplace, and serving a wide range of clients as we do that. And so, sometimes it is, the original owner of that content wants to make sure that they're licensing it to that platform for a fee that's consistent with what its value is, given the size of the audience, and the appetite for that content. In some cases, yes, it might be a studio who is producing it or a other player. So we're really serving a much broader range of needs, a much broader range of clients then just the original source of that content itself, the platform itself.","In some cases, the platform might say, well, look, I already have a lot of data about just how much viewing is happening on my platform. They might not feel a great need for what Nielsen brings the party there, and that's okay. We respect that, but they're still other players who are licensing that content to them, who do want more information about, how much viewing is happening, and how does it compare with the other places that they might choose to license that content instead.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. ","Tom Eagan","Great. Thank you very much. A question on 2016 margins, Jamere had mentioned at Analyst Day that buy margins would be a bigger contributor to overall margin growth in '16. Given the 50 to 70 basis point margin gain guidance, what does that mean for watch margins in '16? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson","Great. So we did give guidance for 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion, and that is on a total Company basis. And we do expect to buy to be a slightly bigger contributor in 2016. The reason for that is really two key drivers. Number one, we're continuing to scale in the emerging markets, and we have a focus on profitability. And as those investments that we've made in the emerging markets continue to scale, then buy margins are moving in the right direction. And you\u2019ve seen buy margins expand over the last six quarters, and we expect that to continue into 2016. And then, the second dynamic is that we\u2019re just running the place with intensity around costs and productivity. We\u2019ve done that for a number of years, and we\u2019re going to continue that in 2016.","So we feel good about the 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion in the company, and we expect buy to be a bigger contributor. Now in terms of watch in 2016, 2016 is an investment year for us, as we look to roll out our new product capabilities. And that investment, isn\u2019t necessarily in the traditional OpEx that you would expect, but we\u2019re going to add a lot of commercial capabilities to help us go after the growth opportunities with digital clients. And so, you can expect margins to be positive in watch, and we\u2019re going to manage the total company to 50 to 70 basis points, and you\u2019re going to expect buy to be a bigger contributor in 2016.","Tom Eagan","Great. Secondly, I have a question about the potential for CPM deflation. One concern I\u2019ve heard from TV networks about combining linear and digital video ratings is that there\u2019s a prospect for CPM deflation, meaning the higher CPM of digital video declining to the linear CPM. So any thoughts you have on how this can be avoided would be great? Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Yes, that\u2019s common conversation in the industry. And I think there\u2019s some things that will counter that, so we\u2019ll see some forces that will push it that direction. We\u2019ll see other forces that will counterbalance that, and one of them is precision. Because you have this, all these data sets that are being connected, great tools being built by Nielsen and others from an analytics capabilities, that enable more and more precision. Not only in the digital world, but even in the linear world going forward. And that increased precision means less waste in terms of advertising exposures that people pay for, and that will be a positive driver on costs, on CPMs.","And in addition, I think we\u2019re also continuing to see people realizing the importance of reach. While you can get incredible precision sometimes in the digital world, it\u2019s hard to have that and reach at the same time. And it\u2019s one reason why linear television continues to hold up so well, even with all of the forces trying to pull viewers away. Linear television still delivers incredible reach in the marketplace, and advertisers know that reach deserves a premium, in terms of getting their advertising message out to brands. The first exposure of my ad to a consumer is the best one, and so reach is what I am really seeking for, first and foremost. Not the only thing, but first and foremost. And so that will be a second positive force that will continue to support the evolution of these CPMs in the market place. Some pluses, some minuses, we\u2019ll see where it plays out, however it plays out. Our total audience measurement system will not only measure it, but enlighten people as to what they\u2019re actually getting in the marketplace, and how does it compare with what they hoped to get when they planned.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman ","Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. Two questions. Of the total 5.6% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, how much was organic, adjusting for both acquisitions and divestitures? And my second question is, could you just mention what the NCS JV ownership went from and to?","Jamere Jackson ","Yes. So on your second question on NCS JV, it went from 50% to 63.5%. And then, if you look at the pieces in terms of organic, you had about 1.5 point in the quarter that came from the NCS and eXelate pieces in the watch business. And then you had, in the buy businesses, are pretty clean from an organic standpoint in the quarter so.","Kate Vanek ","Next question, operator?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins","Hi. Thanks, good morning. Is there anything that you saw in late fourth quarter, early first quarter that makes you think that you\u2019d be at the higher or lower end of the ranges that you\u2019ve given, in some of the segment details at the Investor Day? As an example, 30% growth in marketing effectiveness, the guidance for next year is calling for 15% to 20%. And so, I look at that, and wonder if you\u2019re at, more comfortable at the higher end? But it\u2019s a broader question across both watch and buy?","Jamere Jackson ","Yes. So just to remind you on marketing effectiveness, we said in the third quarter that we saw some work push out from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and you saw that play out in our numbers, which is why we had a growth rate number that is higher than the, sort of the high end of the ranges that we gave. But we feel pretty good about what we gave at Analyst Day, and we\u2019re seeing the trend in the fourth quarter, and early in the first quarter line up very nicely with the ranges that we gave. And we\u2019ve reaffirmed the guidance accordingly.","Mitch Barns","And where we were in the third quarter, Jamere, is around 8%, something like that?","Jamere Jackson ","Yes, you saw marketing effectiveness at about 8%, and remember, marketing and effectiveness, a portion of that is discretionary, portion of that is subscription-based, and oftentimes you may have some work that leaves from one quarter to the other. We did get a little bit of a catch-up in a fourth quarter, but still very strong on an overall basis, and we feel good about the range of 15% to 20% heading into next year.","Mitch Barns","And so, Sara, looking back to last year, 8% in third quarter, a little bit more than 30% in the fourth quarter. And pretty, if you add those two together, pretty similar to our growth of just a little bit more than 20% for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington ","Good morning everyone. So first, I just want to say thank you for the additional disclosure on the watch segment. My question is around the increased ownership in Catalina. Why, and why now? And then also, do you feel that you have all the components necessary, in terms of tying together the watch data, and the point of sale data? And if not, what do you still need to add?","Mitch Barns","Yes, Bill, I'll start off, and Jamere can add. I mentioned in my opening comments how we see this Nielsen Catalina Solutions business as being perfectly aligned with our strategy. So let's take a look at what do they do? Well, they take information about what consumers buy, they connect it with information about what consumers watch, whether it's on television or in the digital world, and therefore their advertising exposure. And then they put that together to provide measurement and analytics capabilities to clients, to help clients first of all, find the right audiences for their advertising, and then also to assess the ROI on that advertising. This is Nielsen, this is right at the heart of our business. And so, while we've enjoyed this very positive and productive partnership with Catalina to put this business together, this is really right at the core of our business. And so, that's why we saw this as something that we really want to secure, the controlling stake in going forward. You see us dong this business by the way, focuses primarily on FMCG brands, consumer packaged goods in the marketplace. We have similar capabilities in our portfolio already, with more to come, that do pretty much the same thing in other verticals out there in the marketplace. So having the controlling stake in this joint venture, also allows us to develop a little bit more scale advantages as we develop similar capabilities to serve other verticals.","Jamere Jackson","Listen, advertisers are asking the question on ROI, and for the big branded advertisers, ROI is the Holy Grail. And you also saw for the media companies last year in the up fronts, where they were taking not only our ratings data, but also taking our marketing effectiveness products like Nielsen Buyer Insights, and Nielsen Catalina Solutions, packaging those together to amplify the value of their inventory. And so, as those market dynamics play out, we see this as a fast growing area of the business, and we've said that we're going to continue to invest in faster growing, high margin pieces of the business. And this is a great investment for us, and we're looking forward to the growth prospects going forward.","Mitch Barns","It's exciting what we're doing in this area, and really what's happening industry overall. I've been around long enough to remember the days when people asked these questions about the ROI on their advertising spend, and there was no answer. And so, then they just stopped asking the question. And here we are today with these data sources available, these tools that enable us to put them together. These questions can be answered now. And that's why you see such strong consistent growth in our marketing effectiveness business, 20% or more in 2015. Most of that coming by the way, from developed markets, because the capabilities are developing and accelerating so rapidly. And there is strong demand from clients all across the marketplace for what Nielsen does in this area and for what others do. So, look, we love what Nielsen Catalina Solutions brings to our portfolio. We love the opportunity now to make it more integrated and connected with similar capabilities that we already have, that serve other verticals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger ","Hi, thanks. You guys mentioned a few times in your prepared remarks, how your business model holds up so well, up and down through the cycles. I would love it if you could remind us going, looking back how Nielsen, the business performed through the previous recession cycles? And then, thinking about the changes in your footprint in the marketplace, how might we expect your business to perform through the next down cycle? That would be very helpful. Thanks.","Mitch Barns","Thanks, Todd, 38 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in our business. And if you draw the line back, that even goes through the big global economic downturn that occurred from late 2007 through 2009. And it's a result of our business model. We're in 106 countries around the world. We serve a broad range of clients. We have a broad portfolio of capabilities, many of which are must have information for clients to run their business with. And in fact, they need some of the kinds of things we do even more, when economic conditions get difficult. So we will shift our focus to those parts of our portfolio that become even more important, when economic conditions grow more complicated, or more challenging for our clients. That enables us to deliver this steady consistent performance in our business around the world.","Jamere Jackson","Yes, and if you look at our core revenue growth, 2008 to 2010, our core revenue grew 4.6%. And again, that speaks to the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen business model. And it's all the things that we've touted for a number of years, being in syndicated businesses, long-term contracts that go three to nine years. We get good pricing, our teams are doing a fantastic job on delivering on productivity through the cycles. And so, in good cycles and bad cycles, the attributes of this business hold up very, very well.","Mitch Barns","Our focus on productivity is especially important here because we are always starting the year developing our own reserve for how to invest back into our business. We are not waiting for the growth to happen, to create the opportunity to invest in the future of our business. We always start with productivity. This is been a real strength of our Company. And I think it's one of the reasons why we move through more challenging economic conditions better than the other companies who operate in the same space that we do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Ryan Leonard","Hi, this is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just want to talk on, I know you don't report the buy insight business, but I think generally that's been a pretty good indicator of future expected growth in that part of the business. There's some concern, I guess, that emerging markets are starting to slow down, and particularly China, you guys have called out the past. Can you just touch on anything you're seeing in emerging markets, and how that more discretionary-based spend is looking for clients, particularly exiting the fourth quarter and into the beginning of the year, just given some of the more choppiness we're seeing out there?","Mitch Barns","Hey, Ryan. Thanks for mentioning China. I always love talking about China, my old home. Our business held up incredibly well in Mainland China in 2015, double-digit growth, even with what was happening in the -- well, the financial markets and the market overall. I think the key reason for that, is in addition to our teams staying focused and executing well and continuing to gain penetration, like I mentioned for our teams what they've done in Brazil, Russia and Turkey, China was very similar for us. The other thing is, we're focused on the consumer, and the consumer markets and retail sales and digital, and other media consumption, the consumer focus of our business. And in China that is largely separate, frankly, from a lot of the turmoil that you've seen any financial markets which has dominated the press about the China market recently. And so, I think it's -- those two things go together, for why we still had a strong year of double-digit growth in Mainland China in 2015.","Jamere Jackson","Yes, listen, I'm encouraged, because what I've seen is really broad based growth. So if you look at Latin America, which is our largest region, it was up double-digits, with one of our largest markets, Brazil being up in the mid-teens. China, our second-largest region was up double-digits in the fourth quarter. The Middle East was up double-digits. Africa which is our fastest growing region, is up single-digits. So we've seen broad-based growth across the markets. I think the other dynamic that really stands out for me, is that in the emerging markets where multi-nationals make up about 65% of our business, we really did see them pivot to growth there over the last year or so. And the growth in the emerging markets for multi-nationals was about on par with what we've seen in locals, where locals at one point were growing significantly faster than the multi-nationals. So broad-based growth, and you've got health in really both segments of the market, in terms of multi-nationals and locals.","Mitch Barns","And into your question about insights specifically, I prefer to think of it as our -- the analytics portion of our business. Again, when the economic conditions get a little bit more difficult and clients are starting to look for direction, and the analytics portfolio that we have is what gives a lot of those answers. So we'll help them with pricing decisions, we'll help them be more efficient with their assortment, we'll help them think differently, about how they market to consumers to be more efficient with their marketing spend. All of these kinds of things tap directly into our analytics portfolio. Not to mention, our leading analytics capabilities around new product innovation. Which we continue to invest in, and believe in the importance of -- the important role it plays in our business going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Andre Benjamin","Good morning. I know its early going, but I was wondering if you could provide some color on what some of the more critical feedback has been so far, with digital content rating and total audience? It's pretty easy to imagine what the positive ones are, given the needs that you address? And then, when should we expect some syndication on those products, and how much of your total client base is currently testing them?","Jamere Jackson","Andrew, we don't do negatives. ","Mitch Barns","I'll be happy to go into a little bit more detail on those, Andre, thanks for the question. Digital content ratings, I mentioned earlier, the roll out is progressing well. We have a diverse range of clients, networks, MVPDs, publishers some -- a number of them fully operational already, more in process, soon to be operational. I mentioned we have a major digital video player to be added in the coming weeks. So we're excited about that and also just strong engagement from the industry broadly, dozens of clients participating on our client advisory board. With regard to syndication of digital content ratings, we said on our last call in quarter three, that we're on track for syndication in the first part of this year, and we remain on track for syndication in the first part of this year. It's likely to be sometime in the early to middle part of the second quarter, but we'll do that with the guidance from our clients. And our upcoming client advisory board will help us firm up, what is the right timing for our clients. That's really where it starts, always where it starts and ends with us, is to do it at the right time, in the right way to best serve their needs in the market. So that's digital content ratings. And then total content ratings, digital content ratings obviously flows into and plays a big part in total content ratings, along with the audience measurement we have of a linear television, video on demand, and everything else. And we're well on track for syndication of total content ratings as well. We would peg that one right around the end of the second quarter of the year right now.","But we already have 70-plus networks that are receiving data from total content ratings. All of that along with everything else from our total audience measurement system is already informing and supporting our client\u2019s thinking and decision making as they approach the 2016 up-fronts. So we already know that it\u2019s being useful to the marketplace, and we\u2019re obviously thrilled about that. And so, one other thing on total content ratings that I think is just interesting to note. We did a recent analysis of, a sampling of shows that we can see through total content ratings. And what we did is we look at the ratings they would get out of total content ratings, and we compared it to the ratings you would get, if you just looked at our audience measurement of linear television. In this case, there are number of people who saw the linear television, either live or through a DVR up to seven days after the live viewing.","So compare total content ratings to linear television ratings, what we see is that in total content ratings, ratings are at least 10% higher in most cases, and in some cases, as much as 50% higher. And so, we know that the system is working and it\u2019s really showing the broader range and the lift that\u2019s available to the clients in the industry, as they contemplate how to redefine the currency. What to include in that new definition of the currency, which is of course, the focus of those ongoing client discussions and meetings that I referred to earlier. So it\u2019s exciting to see where this is going to go in the marketplace, and exciting to see the role that our total audience measurement system is playing in it, in all of it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser ","Hi, it\u2019s Brian Wieser here. Thanks for taking the question. Two I have, first, there seems to be a fair amount of misinformation, even among the CEOs with some of your clients, around some elements of your data. And to the extent that there\u2019s been attacks on, what seemed to be attacks on credibility of the data in some ways, it makes me wonder how, what you\u2019re doing to address it, those attacks in the public sphere? I understand you can\u2019t necessarily correct your clients as much as maybe might be appropriate, or might be needed. But I\u2019m curious about how you\u2019re thinking about that dynamic in general? Separately, I saw your recently resigned Hearst and Media General. And of course, I think you signed Sinclair and Tribune last year on the local side. I\u2019m just curious how the terms of your deals with local station groups are evolving, in terms of term length, price escalators, product extensions or otherwise? Thanks for any thoughts.","Mitch Barns","Yes, thanks, Brian. Great questions. First, on the comments or criticisms, sometimes that we\u2019ll hear from our clients in the marketplace. Look, we understand that, first of all, what I take away from it very initially is, it\u2019s always positive when our clients are talking about us in the marketplace. Because what it says is, we\u2019re highly relevant, and that\u2019s always a good thing. But, of course, I prefer that they are saying good things, as opposed to criticisms. When they\u2019re making criticisms we listen. That\u2019s always the first thing we have to do. And we have to ask ourselves, is that criticism valid? Or is it based on misinformation, or maybe incomplete information? And then we respond accordingly.","And what we almost always do is, we, when we hear a comment like this in the marketplace, we follow up. And we follow-up and we say, look, we would like to understand, we saw or we heard what you said. We\u2019d like to understand a little bit more about why you said that? And that often gives us a case to bring that particular client up to date on something. It gives us a chance to make our case on something. And in some cases, it gives us a chance to learn, and we get better from that. And so, it\u2019s always productive, when we respond to it in the right way. And we\u2019ve been very focused on doing exactly that in the past year, and we\u2019re going to continue that in the year ahead.","While we don\u2019t, never expect those kinds of comments to go away entirely, we do see, and we have heard others say, that when we\u2019re making progress on that front. And so, we feel good about that, and we\u2019re going to stay focused on it. On your other question about Hearst and Media General, you also mentioned Sinclair and Tribune. We\u2019re thrilled, whether it\u2019s a client who signing a contract with us for the first time, or whether it\u2019s the 50th time, we\u2019re always thrilled by those. And so, the renewals here that are happening in our local television business, they really are renewals, they\u2019re just that.","And the terms reflect I think where we are in this part of the business. The local television business has been over the last several years, the trend line has been low-single-digit growth, and the contract renewals reflect that, and are consistent with that. What you\u2019re also seeing though, with the, for instance the Hearst renewal recently, is it\u2019s not just focused on local television, linear television audience measurement. But also they\u2019re starting to tap increasingly into the broader range of capabilities we can bring to them, both for digital measurement, and also for analytics that help them better sell their ad inventory to their advertiser clients in the marketplace. And so, we\u2019re seeing these relationships broaden a bit to utilize more of the capabilities we bring to the marketplace. That\u2019s a big positive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen","Hi. Thank you. My question is about total audience measurement, and I wonder if you could help me, let me know if I\u2019m thinking about this the right way? Back in the day, Nielsen TV ratings were basically the only way for a TV network to monetize advertising. Now there are other ways. There are competitors to some degree, TV networks that have their own apps, can collect their own data, to use that to sell ads. So my question is, I don't think anybody questions the relevancy of Nielsen total audience measurement, but is it possible to break down how the revenue streams may look as in, will you sell total audience measurement as a data source, as a subscription as you always have your ratings? And then, is there a separate element of selling data with fees in the programmatic buying exchanges? I just if you could maybe help us understand, how we should think about the total audience measurement revenue stream? Does that make sense?","Mitch Barns","Yes, it does. I'll share a few thoughts on that and maybe Jamere will have something to add First, with regard to competitors or networks or publishers who have their own data, there are two things that we bring that are highly differentiated, versus anybody else out there. One is, we bring a comprehensive view, especially when it comes to video, we are able to bring the full range of places and ways that consumers view video content. That's our total audience measurement system. That's what it's about. Nobody else has that comprehensive view with the level of quality and granularity that we bring to the market. So that's one. And then the other is independence, which is incredibly important in the marketplace. For instance, if I am a digital publisher and I have my own data, I can share that with an advertiser. So that's great, in terms of helping that advertiser understand what's possible on my particular platform. But what I can't put that in context, relative to the rest of the options available to that advertiser, and I'm also not an independent provider of that information. And so, advertisers ultimately want that independence, so that things are looked at in the same way, with objectivity. Not only in that particular publisher's platform, but across other platforms. And to your point about subscription versus maybe more volume based, as might be more typical these days in the ad tech world. And then, there's another dimension which is measurement versus analytics. Yes, I think that's exactly consistent with our experience over the past two years. We see a wider range of business models, and expressed in the way we've contracted with or engaged with our clients. ","And part of that is just a state of the fragmentation, and the pace of change in the industry. And it likely will converge to be a narrower range of business models going forward, but it's helpful for clients to have that flexibility right now, as everything's changing so fast in the marketplace. For instance, if I am going to sign up for a fee based service, then I need to know whether or not I'm going to really get value out of that fee based service over the course of the year, that there are maybe multiple years of that contract applies to. But if it's something that's emerging in the marketplace rapidly, it's kind of hard to know, where it's going to be a year or two or three years down the road. And so, I might prefer to instead sign up for more of a volume based contract right now, because I don't know if it's going to be 2 times bigger next year or 5 time or 10 times bigger next year. So volume based would be a better way to contract, and we offer the kind of flexibility to our clients. And I think that serves us well. Jamere?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So just a couple things. One, today, we have the ratings data on a subscription basis, but we sell data sets into agencies and programmatic networks today. And so, that model will continue in the future. In terms of the way contracts will be structured, we anticipate having our large media clients continue to do the broad MSAs with us, but we're also signing up a number of native digital clients. And those are all new clients for us and new opportunities to grow our business. So as Mitch said, were pretty flexible in terms of the business model. But you'll continue to see us have consistent, steady long-term contracts with our big clients, and we're signing up new native digital clients, and we're pumping data into programmatic networks today, largely through our eXelate acquisition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Young with Evercore. Your line is open.","Kate Vanek","Tracy, did we lose you?","Tracy Young","I'm sorry. I had mute on. When we I know you don't break out the buy margin segments between developing and emerging markets, but should we think about the ability for you for the margins in emerging to be similar to developed? Thank you.","Jamere Jackson","So, the margins in the emerging markets are still quite a bit lower than what they are in the developed world. And as I said before, the reason that we're seeing margin expansion is that those margins in the emerging markets are actually improving. So as you continue to build scale in those markets, and you get your margins to move in the right direction. So we still have some runway in terms of margin inside buy, and it's the reason we had confidence going forward, that our buy margins will continue to expand in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mitch, I turn the call back over to you.","Mitch Barns","Thank you. Well, just a few final words before we wrap up. Look, we're thrilled with how 2015 unfolded for us, banner year, showing our steady, consistent and resilient business model and execution by our teams. We're all about measuring performance for our clients and helping them improve. And by doing that well, we deliver value to our shareholders, puts us in that position. As we look to 2016, we're going to stay focused on these three key strategic initiatives, total audience on the watch"],"15580":["Nielsen N.V.

[Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Nielsen. Please go ahead.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Good morning, everybody, and thanks so much for joining us today to discuss Nielsen's fourth quarter and full year 2014 performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, CEO; and Jamere Jackson, CFO. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our IR website at nielsen.com\\investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of '95. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, February 12, 2015.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties.

Then Jamere will discuss financials for the quarter and the year and will also provide updates on our full year guidance. [Operator Instructions] Know that as always, the IR team is here to answer any questions after the call.","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today.","Look, 2014 was a terrific year. Our steady, consistent financial performance reflects solid execution by our teams against the commitments we laid out a year ago, including our commitment to delivering value for our shareholders.","But it's not just our financial performance that made 2014 great. We're also stronger than we were a year ago thanks to the progress we made on our key initiatives. Top to bottom, all across our company, there's a high level of energy and optimism about our future and the opportunities ahead. But before we talk about what's ahead, let's take a look at the full year numbers for 2014.","First, we had solid revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, 2014 revenues grew 12.4%. Excluding the Arbitron and Harris acquisitions, our core revenue growth was 4.5%. That's more than 0.5 point better than in 2013.","Core Watch revenues increased by nearly 6%, including a 6.3% increase in Audience Measurement. And our local television revenues grew at the highest rate we've seen in several years, up 4.5%. That's a fact that might be surprising to some of you.","Core Buy revenues were up approximately 4%, including a 9.5% increase in emerging markets.","Next, adjusted EBITDA was up 13.6% or 16.5% constant currency, reflecting the scalability of our business model. Adjusted net income per share grew 30% constant currency to $2.52. Free cash flow was a record $681 million, up 19% over the prior year.","Our powerful business model enables us to invest in key growth initiatives while also returning cash to our shareholders. In 2014, we returned over $800 million in cash to shareholders, and we have plans to deliver an additional $1.6 billion by mid-2016 through a growing dividend and our previously announced share repurchase program.","Acquisitions are another part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, and our team continued to prove themselves as highly effective integrators through their work on 2 big acquisitions in 2014, Arbitron and Harris Interactive. We delivered on our expected cost synergies, and we brought new capabilities and product enhancements to clients.","While our teams continue to be fully focused on execution and innovation for 2015, as a global company, we're facing the same FX headwinds as our multinational peers, and I know that isn't a surprise to any of you. Jamere will cover how that will impact our guidance for 2015.","Let's turn to 2015. I'll cover some of our fundamental strengths and why we're bullish on the year ahead.","First, Audience Measurement. Media fragmentation continues to accelerate. The consumers have more choice and more control than ever, and it shows in the growing diversity of how people consume media content. Our response is to focus on the consumer. That's what we do. We follow consumers and measure them no matter how, where and when they watch. It's exactly what the market needs: independent, third-party measurement based on currency grade ratings that are comparable across all screens, platforms and ad models that roll up to represent the total audience. You'll see us continue to invest and innovate against that objective.","You'll also see us step up our communication to the market. We'll simplify the language we use to describe our measurement system, making it easier for our clients and our investors to see how all of the parts fit together to represent the total audience.","We'll also continue to work with the market to update the rules regarding what viewing can be included in the currency ratings in response to changing consumer viewing habits. This is important for the monetization of audiences and the overall efficiency of the market.","So let's talk about where we are today and what you can expect us to deliver in 2015. Today, there's no doubt in our minds that we're winning. In linear television measurement, we have the world's highest-quality panel, the gold standard source of truth. Our panels remain essential, and they're a key differentiator for us even as our approach to measurement evolves, and it will.","As we said at our December Analyst Day, the future of measurement is not about choosing between panels and big data. Instead, it's about combining high-quality panels with highly granular big datasets to have the best of both worlds. This is the direction we're taking with our entire measurement portfolio, including Audience Measurement.","We also continue to add to our measurement coverage. A key area of focus for us right now is Video On Demand, both subscription-based and ad-supported models. Capturing these fast-growing slices of over-the-top viewing is a key next step in our effort to provide clients with a complete picture of the total audience in 2015.","We're also working to enhance our measurement system for local television markets, and our clients are responding well to our plan. Specifically, later this year, we'll bring electronic measurement to 14 additional markets and improve demographic measurement to all 31 set meter markets. We're also taking steps to improve the stability of the ratings.","These are important steps forward, and it's worth noting that in 2014, we successfully renewed every major local television contract that was up for renewal. But having said that, it remains true that local will continue to be a more challenging part of the market, and we're fully focused on carrying out our product improvement plans for our clients.","In Digital, we, of course, have OCR, which built great momentum in 2014, and that's carried into early 2015. In the U.S., 19 out of the top 25 advertisers now endorse OCR. Major publishers tell us that the RFPs they're receiving from advertisers are specifically requesting or even requiring OCR. And overall, we're seeing the same high renewal rates that we see in television, and importantly, pricing remains strong.","Our relationship with Google is proceeding well. Our integration with DoubleClick is complete, and a growing number of major clients are now engaging through the DoubleClick platform, for example, the Mediabrands agencies within IPG. And of course, YouTube is offering OCR guarantees to advertisers for their media buys.","We're also making good progress on OCR's international expansion, with Japan and China next up. In Japan, we formed a joint venture with Intage, and in the second quarter, we'll launch OCR through that partnership. In China, we're partnering with Tencent, a leading provider of comprehensive Internet services in that market. And we're on track for an April launch in China.","On another front, we're progressing extremely well in our partnership with Adobe, working on the rollout of Digital Content Ratings. We expect the beta rollout in mid-2015 and full production mode later in the year. As you may recall, Digital Content Ratings measure audiences for digital content, using the same measurement architecture as OCR, which measures ads. Feedback from clients has been extremely positive. They see immense value in a single source of truth that brings together Adobe's analytics with Nielsen's ratings for digital content.","So that's a high-level overview of our positioning and plans for a total Audience Measurement. We're creating a measurement system where all viewing can be consistently and comparably measured with independent currency grade ratings for both content and ads. That's what total Audience Measurement is all about.","In our Buy business, our global presence is unmatched. And our growth continues to be fueled by powerful long-term tailwinds: population growth, the rise of the middle class and urbanization. We've been investing consistently behind these trends, and it's paying off, evidenced by both the revenue growth and an improving margin trend.","In 2014, our emerging markets business grew 9.5%, and that's up from 7% in 2013. The growth is accelerating. We continue to be underpenetrated in emerging markets, so we have plenty of runway for growth, with both the big multinationals as well as with the local and regional players.","In developed markets, conditions are a bit more challenging, but we continue to win clients, and we've recently seen some improvement in discretionary spend. For instance, in the fourth quarter in North America, we saw stronger client demand in our innovation practice. This part of our business has often been a leading indicator that clients are investing in growth.","Touching on e-commerce. The launch of our Alibaba omni-channel measurement in China has seen a nice take-up rate from manufacturers. And we continue to make similar progress in several other markets around the world. With the rapidly growing role of e-commerce and the ongoing importance of retailers to all parts of our business, we recently made the decision to organize around retailers as a vertical to increase our focus and speed of development in this area. This is an important move for us, and we'll have more to say as our plans unfold.","Finally, turning to Marketing Effectiveness, formerly called Advertiser Solutions. We continue to see strong growth, with revenue up more than 13% in 2014. Chief marketing officers turn to Nielsen to help them measure and improve the ROI of their marketing spend with a level of precision and actionability not previously available. In short, we're helping clients trim waste from their marketing programs, not just in our core verticals of consumer packaged goods and media but also in the auto, financial, telecom, entertainment and retail verticals.","I'll close my remarks by saying, we're entering 2015 in a position of strength. The energy and optimism I see from my Nielsen colleagues around the world give me a great deal of confidence that we'll continue to execute and deliver. Jamere, over to you.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. First, let me give a few more details on our 2014 performance and how that stacked up relative to the guidance we gave in December.","Revenue was $6.3 billion, up 12.4% constant currency, which is slightly above the 12% growth rate we gave. Excluding the impact of the Arbitron and Harris acquisitions, revenue grew 4.5% constant currency.","Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion, up 16.5% constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.2%, up 101 basis points on a constant currency basis as we executed on our productivity initiatives and successfully integrated the Arbitron business.","Adjusted net income was $970 million, up 30.9% constant currency. And diluted adjusted net income per share was $2.52, in the middle of the $2.50 to $2.55 range we gave and up 29.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis.","Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $681 million, up 19% versus a year ago. There was a $15 million impact from FX, so we were actually closer to the $700 million guidance we gave when you exclude the rate impact.","Once again, we had good execution around the world, and we delivered consistent, steady revenue growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow results in 2014. In addition, we returned over $800 million to shareholders as we increased the dividend by 25% and executed approximately $500 million in share repurchases.","Our business remains well positioned to deliver consistent growth through the cycles, and our strong balance sheet and accelerating free cash flow enable us to grow our business and return cash to shareholders in a meaningful way.","Moving to the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5.4% constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Arbitron and Harris acquisitions, revenue grew 4.4% constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was $524 million, up 6.9% constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.1%, up 48 basis points as we delivered a very strong 119 basis points expansion in Watch margins and 21 basis points expansion in Buy margins, both on a constant currency basis.","Adjusted net income was $309 million, up 18.8% constant currency. And diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.81, up 19.1% versus prior year on a constant currency basis.","Finally, we generated $263 million in free cash flow, up 12.4% versus a year ago. As Mitch said, we finished the year on a strong note, and we have tremendous momentum heading into 2015.","Next, I'll move to segment revenue and give you a little color on the pieces. As I mentioned, revenue was up 5.4% for the quarter, and we saw strength in both Watch and Buy. This also marks the 34th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for our business, reflecting our remarkable consistency and resiliency through the cycles.","Now first let me highlight that we're changing the way we present our Buy segment in order to provide a better depiction of our Buy business. As we illustrated when we broke down our 2015 guidance levers, we'll be speaking about the segment in terms of developed markets and emerging markets as opposed to a view on information versus insights. Now the mix of the business remains fairly constant at roughly 75% information, which tends to be recurring in nature, and 25% insights, which tend to be more discretionary in nature. As we've talked in the past, we are increasingly linking our Information and Insights offerings together to help our clients both measure their performance as well as improve their performance.","Secondly, this presentation mirrors how we manage the business, and importantly, we will continue to provide color on the discretionary spend environment and the impact it has on our performance and growth rates.","With that, let me turn to the Buy business. Total Buy revenue was $908 million, up 6.4% in constant currency and up 3.8% excluding the Harris acquisition. The Buy business continues to operate in a 2-speed world, with developed markets revenue of $611 million, up 4.8%, which grew just under 1% excluding the Harris acquisition, while emerging markets continue to deliver broad-based growth, with revenue of $297 million, up 10%. In particular, we saw strong growth in Greater China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, which were all up double digits. Our continued commitment to investing in coverage and analytics capability has delivered back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth in the emerging markets.","For reference in the closeout 2014 and to help you with your modeling, our Information revenue was $648 million, up almost 1%, and our Insights revenue was $260 million, up 23.8% constant currency. Excluding Harris, Insights was up 12.9%. The Insights growth x Harris was a result of a modest rebound in discretionary spending in areas like advanced analytics, segmentation and innovation. And as John Lewis spoke about at our Investor Day, we have added capabilities in the innovation space, which we are very excited about.","Our Watch business revenue was $725 million, up 4% constant currency or 5.5% excluding Arbitron. We saw continued strength in Audience Measurement, which excluding Audio, was up 6.5%.","Our Digital business, which is included in Audience Measurement, has great momentum as revenues doubled, albeit on a small base.","Marketing Effectiveness grew 17.5%, which is a reflection of increased penetration with both CPG and non-CPG clients. So again, another quarter of consistent, steady revenue growth for Nielsen.","Moving to profitability. Buy EBITDA was $202 million, up 7.4% constant currency. I am happy to report that Buy margins were up 21 basis points in the quarter and moving in the right direction while we continue to invest in emerging markets. Margin expansion will continue to be a big focus area for our team as we support our clients, gain scale and drive efficiencies.","On the Watch side, EBITDA was $329 million, up 6.8% constant currency. Watch margins were up 119 basis points as we continue to drive productivity and operating leverage in our Audience Measurement business.","Overall, profitability remains strong. Total company margins were up 48 basis points on a constant currency basis, in line with our long-term historical performance as we continue to invest in our key growth catalysts.","Next, I'll move to foreign currency. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on third-party transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes.","Now like many multinationals, we saw significant foreign currency impacts that resulted in a 400 basis point drag on revenue and a 380 basis points drag on EBITDA during the quarter. The drag was about 110 basis points greater on revenue and about 80 basis points greater on EBITDA than what we laid out on our 3Q earnings call, which is about $0.01 a share impact on our adjusted net income.","Separately, we took a $29 million charge on 12\/31 related to the revaluation impacts from the Venezuelan bolivar to the SICAD II rates. If February 10 spot rates held constant in 2015, then we expect a 390 basis points drag on revenue and a 300 basis points drag on EBITDA in 2015. This movement in rates represents a $0.12 a share impact versus our December Analyst Day guidance.","Next, I'll move to the balance sheet and key metrics. On the top left are some of the key financial metrics, which were all pretty much in line with what we said previously. On the bottom left is our net debt ratio. Our gross debt is $6.9 billion, with $273 million in cash to get to $6.6 billion of net debt and a 3.59x net ratio.","On the capital table on the right, our debt ticked slightly higher since 3Q as we executed on our capital allocation strategy. And our weighted average interest rate is down slightly at 3.79%.","Next, I'll flip to 2015 guidance. We are updating our 2015 guidance to reflect the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a result, we now see adjusted net income per share in the $2.68 to $2.74 range, which is $0.12 lower on the top and bottom end of the range. This is a combination of the impact due to the stronger dollar and the Venezuela revaluation that I mentioned earlier.","Also, based on foreign exchange rates, we have updated our 2015 cash flow to a range of $850 million to $900 million. We also plan to hold leverage roughly where we ended 2014 in the 3.6x area, and we're reaffirming all of the other metrics on the page.","So let me wrap up. We are pleased with our execution in 4Q and 2014 where we delivered steady consistent revenue growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow. We are delivering on our commitment to grow our business with investments in acquisitions and key growth initiatives. And executing on these initiatives, combined with our plans to return roughly $1.6 billion in cash back to shareholders over the next 1.5 years, gives us confidence we have the elements in place to continue to drive long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Kate.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Laurel, we'd like to start Q&A now if you could turn to the first person in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with BOA Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk about, over the long term, margin expansion potential? And given all the investments that you're making, particularly on the Watch side but also continuing on the Buy side, does that hamper margin expansion going forward?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks, Sara, for the question. Look, our business model has this scalable nature to it. So much of our revenues are subscription-based and long-term contracts. And we've consistently been able to expand margins across our entire business, both Watch and Buy, in the range of 40 to 60 basis points a year. And that allows us to -- more than enough flexibility to continue to invest back in our business, which we've done, including those investments in emerging markets that we've been very consistent about now for several years in a row. And you see that pay off as our emerging markets growth rate has accelerated from 7% in 2013, 9.5% in 2014. The second half of 2014 was even a little better than the first half. So we're able to do both. That's the beauty of our business model. Jamere, anything to add to that?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So as you saw in the quarter, we were up 21 basis points on a constant currency basis in our Buy margins in the fourth quarter after being flat in the third quarter. And so for the total year 2014, we were down 30 basis points. And if you recall, in 2013, we were down 66 basis points. So Buy margins are definitely moving in the right direction. And what we've said is that some of the emerging market investments are starting to scale, and margins as a result of that are starting to move in the right direction. As Mitch said, we're going to continue to invest in a disciplined way. We'll give you more color as the year goes on. But we are still committing total company in the 50 to 70 basis points margin expansion for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So you guys have been an early mover internationally, particularly in the emerging markets, and you're seeing really nice growth there. I'm wondering if you can speak to how the competitive landscape might be changing and how that's trending outside of the U.S., especially in light of the recently announced alliance of some of your competitors.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, thanks for the question, Anj. First, on the Buy side of our business, it's one of the beauties of the Buy side of our business is we are the one who is willing to go into many of these markets that are incredibly difficult to measure, where the retail environment is dominated by the traditional trade, and it takes an incredible amount of execution, ability and discipline to measure these markets exactly what the consumer packaged goods companies need. And we've done a very good job at that, and we still have a lot more work to do and a lot more runway for growth on that side of our business. On the Watch side of our business, look, we love our position. We have our Audience Measurement capabilities on the linear television side now, more than 30 markets around the world, which is a fantastic footprint. On the Digital side, we've been making great progress in expanding OCR to new markets. We're already in 8 of the most important markets outside the U.S. And then we have plans in 2015 to roll to an additional 7 markets above and beyond those 8, 5 in Southeast Asia, plus Japan and China, which I've mentioned in my remarks at the outset of the call. So look, we love where we are, we love our plan, and we're going to execute against it. And we think in many respects, what you're seeing from competition is that they're playing catch-up in a world we're already in a lot of these markets, the most important ones, with both measurement capabilities on the television and the digital side. And they see the need to -- you can't play in just one part of the market anymore. It's really about measuring the total audience, and you got to have the full set of assets and capabilities. And I think some of the other players have realized that they're missing important parts of the total picture.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess this one's really for Mitch. It seems to us that there's always kind of an awful lot of chatter in the marketplace right now around competitors offering potential alternatives for measurement, suggesting that there should potentially be pricing pressure or share loss for you. And what's really remarkable about this quarter and the year that just finished, I think, is basically how little they seem to suggest any of this controversy is playing out in the marketplace. So how do you reconcile the noise with the consistency of the results? What -- how do you -- you have looks like kind of consistent 5% constant currency growth through the year, and it sounds like you're seeing more of the same. What is the noise versus what's really going on?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question, David. Yes, you're right. I mean, even our local business, if we mention that very solid growth in 2014, a lot of noise in that part of the market, but really all across the board. I think the difference is a lot of the other players are looking at just a slice of the market. They're measuring a piece of it. And while that's interesting, what the major players need is they need the complete picture, the total audience, as we describe it. And so you have to have comparable metrics across each of these individual slices. You have to deliver those metrics at currency grade, and you have to be able to put them all together to represent the total picture. And we're working against that objective. We have that plan laid out. We know it's perfectly aligned with where our clients go because they told us as much, and we're executing against it. So other players who might be looking at a particular piece of the market, that's not perfectly aligned with where the market knows it's going longer term. A second thing that I'll mention here, though, is sometimes there is a difference between what is about measurement and what is about analytics. And in some cases, you'll find other services that are out there, other datasets that will be available to clients that they're using not to measure their performance but to add additional diagnostic metrics and additional characteristics about the audiences. And in those instances, what you'll find is those things are very complementary to the core of our business. And so that's one reason why you don't see that competitive impact on our financial performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I had a question on the Watch business. The constant currency reported growth of 4%, but then excluding Arbitron, the constant currency reported growth was 5.5%. And so I just wanted to double-check on what was going on with Arbitron and whether I had those numbers right.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So on Audio, it was 150 basis points drag on the overall growth rate. The revenue was down 1% in the quarter, which is only about $2 million, and it was mainly due to timing. Overall for the year, the business finished where we thought it would, and so that was the only impact that you saw in the quarter is a timing difference between the third and the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Andrew. Jamere, I wanted to ask you about Arbitron. I remember that it closed in September 2013, so that would be included in a organic number in the fourth quarter. And so my question also is, what would be a pure organic revenue growth, pure organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter if we included Arbitron but excluded some of the small acquisitions of 2014?","Jamere Jackson","So what we said is our Watch revenue, excluding Audio, was about 5.5% in the quarter. The Audio revenue was about 150 basis points drag. So if you included both, you'd be at the number that we actually reported there.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","But 150 basis points drag at least in part due to the timing issue you mentioned before.","Jamere Jackson","Exactly. And so on an ongoing basis, you would expect that our Audience Measurement business, growing at 6%. We talked about Marketing Effectiveness growing at double digits, a little bit of drag in the other Watch business. So for the total year, our Watch business x Audio was about 5.8% or almost 6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Phil calling in for Ashwin. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the organic growth rate, I guess, from an overall perspective. So you came in about 4.5% for the year and the quarter, you're guiding to 4% to 6%. Just wondering, if you ended up coming in at the high end of the range for 2015, what do you think the drivers might be to get you to that 6% range?","Jamere Jackson","So we talked about it when we laid out our 2015 guidance, when we broke down the elements. And what we said there is that our Watch business would grow somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.5% to 6.5%, and it's driven based on 3 factors. One is the ongoing success with our total Audience Measurement business. As Mitch talked about, we're making great progress there. We have continued traction with our digital ratings, and then the momentum that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness. Those things going very, very well gets us to a 4.5% to 6.5% range there. And then on the Buy side of the business, we said, look, we have a 2-speed world here. In the developed world, we see 1.5% to 3.5%, and in emerging markets, 8% to 10%, which gets you to somewhere in the 3.5% to 5.5% range on the Buy side of the business. And the catalysts there will be continued progress with new client wins, some moderate recovery in the global discretionary spend environment, which we've talked a little bit about here in the quarter, and then continuing progress with the emerging markets, fueled by our local clients, which has been a great story for us this year. So that gives you a little bit of the pieces on how we see next year. And again, how these range drivers go will determine where we ultimately end up in the 4% to 6% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I'm going to stick with a question around Arbitron, too, but not so much impact in the quarter or the year, but just maybe an update on the innovation there. I remember when the acquisition closed, you talked a lot about taking some steps to integrate it with the Marketing Effectiveness products, eventually to roll out maybe some streaming products. And just interested in an update there on where the product innovation is headed these days.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Dan. We're making great progress on that front. There are 3 components in particular that we talk a lot about internally. One of them is international expansion, which, of course, we have the global footprint and relationships in a lot of these key parts of the world. And we'd made some progress there. We, I think on the previous earnings call, mentioned Turkey as one of our new market expansions. We've been successful also in extending some of our radio Audience Measurement contracts in some other key markets, in particular in Southeast Asia. So we feel good about the progress we're making there. As we always said, that will be a slow one because a lot of those are multiyear contracts, and you have to wait for them to come available. On Marketing Effectiveness, it's bringing together the listening data with the purchasing data. We've run a number of studies on that front, which we've shared with the market. And it's generated a tremendous amount of interest and excitement because it's shown that there's a very good return on investment in radio advertising for the right brand, done in the right way. And we've seen nice uptake in additional studies of our -- and leveraging our analytics capability in that area. Then finally, on digital streaming, this is one that we have made some good progress in terms of aligning the industry. We're not quite across the finish line yet. Just to say another word about that, we have the technical measurement capability. We already have that. That's not the issue. It leverages our OCR architecture. So we're able to measure digital streaming. It's more about how it gets reported and getting the different players in the marketplace to align and agree on how it will be reported in the marketplace. And we've made progress on that conversation with the market over the last few months, but we're not quite all the way there yet, and so we have more work to do. And we're hopeful, optimistic that we'll bring that one across the finish line sometime later this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","My question was actually exactly on what you were just saying, Mitch, which was about the steps to adoption of a broader rating system. At least 2 of your major TV companies, when they reported, said some very positive things about the progress that you have been making in incorporating digital measurement. I wonder if you can just maybe explain what the steps are left to do. I guess the technology is there. You're getting your SDK embedded on some of the pay TV platforms. Is it really just about kind of getting the industry to discuss what a new rating standard means? And if that's the case, you mentioned later this year -- I mean, does that mean by maybe the upfront market in 2016 that we'll be talking about a broader Nielsen rating standard? If you can just walk us through the time line there and what finally really actually does get us over the hump.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, sure. There's a lot of activity here. It all fits under the banner of our total audience framework, which continues to serve us incredibly well. One of the pieces that we have on our product road map for 2015 is bringing enhanced Video On Demand measurement capabilities to the market. I mentioned these in my prepared comments, but this is about better measurement of subscription and advertising supported Video On Demand. So the subscription part of that, of course, would include Netflix. So we have our product development plans on that. We'll roll out those capabilities later this year, and we're well on track on that front. Then on the mobile front where clients have a number of steps they have to go through, one is to decide on their business model. Do they want to include mobile viewing in the currency TV ratings? Or do they want to measure it as -- and monetize it as digital viewing? So they have to make that decision. Then their engineers have to embed software code into their apps, and then they have to organize their business around it. And so that dictates the time line to some degree on that front. Then there is also the definition of the currency rating out there in the marketplace. And I mentioned that we're engaging with the market around looking at that definition, updating it, changing it so that it captures more of the viewing that's happening, giving all of the changes in consumer viewing habits that have run forward in recent years. That's another really important step. And then finally, it's also about clients organizing their teams with -- and their business models around this new way of thinking about the future in the media world. All of that then plays into the upfronts. So we've seen the upfronts evolve over the last few years, and you're going to see that evolution continue and probably in a big way for this next set of upfronts that we'll go into. I think more clients will be thinking about the total audience, both digital and linear TV as opposed to them being 2 separate and distinct worlds. More of them are going to approach that as one big picture and look to monetize across these platforms. And we'll have the framework in place for them to do that, with more of the pieces filled in, in that puzzle, of course, by the fall of 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just a question on the local television growth. I think it was better than some people expected. Just how does that compare to prior years? And I think you said that the market was still challenging, I think was the word you used. Is that just in terms of the local advertisers? Or is that in terms of competition?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Local business grew with the best rate we've seen in the past several years in 2014. There are a number of factors there. We had some new capabilities we brought to the market. Our contract renewals were very solid, as I mentioned. There's also an election year, which was a little bit of a tailwind in 2014, that of course won't recur as early as 2015, come back in 2016 again, of course. But with those 3 factors together, that drove that solid 4.5% growth rate on our local television business in 2014. Yes, our product improvement needs, we've been very clear about those. Our clients have been very clear about their need to see us improve the product to keep up with the impact of media fragmentation that's occurred in the market. The second thing that we know a lot of our local clients are looking for is help as they seek to monetize viewing that's happening on digital and mobile platforms. And by the way, we're very well positioned to help them on those fronts. It's an area that will probably create some new growth opportunities as we move through 2015 and beyond. So more work to do there, but bringing that electronic measurement to 14 new markets, better demographics to the 31 set meter markets and then increased rating stability by increasing the sample sizes and bringing some very sophisticated statistical modeling to the picture, these are going to be some really important product improvements in 2015, and we like our position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sticking on a longer-term theme here, there are all sorts of theories about how advertising mix and spend by marketers will evolve in the states over time. But one theory that seems to be becoming increasingly popular is a scenario where television advertising revenue maybe slows down in its growth rate or maybe even starts to decline in an absolute sense but probably be picked up in that scenario with some expected growth on the digital side. If that were a scenario that played out, what does that mean to Nielsen over the long term, especially as you think of your mix of your products and your customers in terms of your revenue growth rate and impact on margins?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question, Todd. It's a great one. Look, what that will mean is that we made exactly the right move with respect to this total audience framework because that framework is, in fact, designed to capture all that viewing no matter where that consumer goes. Starts with the consumer, follows the consumer, no matter where, how and when the consumer views the video content. The idea about television versus a lot of these new areas where consumers can go, the attraction of the digital side of the world is precision. You can more precisely find the specific consumer that your brand really wants to focus on. And that precision is appealing, and it's important, and there's a lot of value in that precision. But here is the other thing. There's another side to this equation, which is weak. And one of the things that the digital world doesn't yet deliver, as well as the traditional television world, is those big reach numbers. And reach is still really important to brand marketers. There's a reach premium that gets paid in the television world, and I don't think that's ever going to change. I think that there will always be a reach premium. Television will always be in a good position to deliver that reach. Digital world will eventually figure out how to deliver big reach numbers, too, but TV's got a big leg up on that front. So it will be that push and pull between the desire for precision, which digital delivers really well, and the need for reach. And that's really what's going to dictate just how this one unfolds. Either way, our total audience framework positions us to capture it, to measure it and help our clients monetize it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I just want to revisit the topic of the noise around the marketplace that's been going on, in particular this morning's news. And I guess I just wanted to get your current thoughts on the idea that it's not just your competitors, it's strictly your customers that are driving a lot of the noise. And at the same time, they're not using your products any less. They continue to depend on them more than ever in many cases, and yet they're noisier than ever. I just want to hear your thoughts on why you think that noise is in the marketplace. Is it just an attempt to get better leverage in negotiations or something else?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. Well, certainly, one of the issues here is one that we're very well aligned with our clients. And that's what I mentioned before about the definition of what gets included in the Nielsen ratings. And sometimes when our clients refer to Nielsen, they're referring to that rating, that traditional television rating. And they're frustrated with that because it's not as broadly defined as they know it needs to be given the changes in consumer viewing habits that have unfolded in recent years. But they still use the single word Nielsen to refer to their frustration with that. And sometimes people, I think, hear that and get confused. They think they're talking about the company. But we join them in that concern. We join them in the idea that, that definition needs to be reevaluated. It needs to be expanded to include more of the viewing that's happening out there, much of the viewing, by the way, that we are already capturing and reporting to our clients. But the more of that viewing that gets included in the currency TV rating, the more certainty they have about their business, in many respects, the easier it is for them to monetize that viewing. So we understand why they want that to be relooked, and that's a big objective of ours, to lead that conversation in the industry. It's not a decision we can make on our own unilaterally. It's one that the industry really has to come together on and decide, and we can play a role in that, but we need everybody to come together, both sides of the table. But that's the big one. On the competitive side, look, I mentioned before about some of the announcements that you saw this morning. A lot of that is I think companies playing catch-up with where we already are, realizing that you can't have just a piece of the puzzle, and also the increasing interest that clients have in looking at these key markets around the world. And we like our digital position, our television Audience Measurement position across the most important media markets around the world. And we're going to continue to expand that footprint, as I mentioned, on the digital front, adding 7 additional markets during the year. And China's really a big one, by the way. Of course, world's largest population of Internet users, world's most important growth market. We're allied with the best possible partner in that market in Tencent. So yes, those are my thoughts back to you, Brian, on your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question is also on the local TV market. I know we've talked in the past about bringing some of the set top box data products that can run alongside your core Nielsen rating. I was wondering where you stand on the launch of some of those products. And just any update on where you stand on the timing on whether or not the scale of those products in terms of the -- I guess, the number of boxes measured or partnerships should be comparable to your competitors?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Good one, Andre. Thanks for the question. We mentioned this concept of the -- how we view the future of measurement before, and it's really very closely aligned with your question. The future of measurement for us is about taking our high-quality panels, which we have both on the Watch and on the Buy side of our business, and combining them with these big datasets, these highly granular big datasets that are increasingly available across different parts of the market. That's the direction we see our entire measurement portfolio going. Not just local television, not just Audience Measurement but across both Watch and Buy. And we're already moving in that direction in certain parts of our portfolio. For example, OCR, that's exactly the way OCR works. It leverages a high-quality panel and a very big dataset known as the Facebook user registration database as well as other datasets from Experian and others, bringing the strengths, the respective strengths of those 2 sources of information together to have the best of both worlds. We're looking to bring that same idea, that same concept to local television Audience Measurement and every other part of our measurement portfolio in our company. That is the future of measurement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for Jamere. Jamere, with the additional FX headwinds, have you -- and to keep margins expanding 50 to 70 basis points, have you had to be a little -- sort of tighten up the belt on internal spend? Or has there been no change of plans?","Jamere Jackson","First, let me say that fundamentally, we run the business the same way that we always have. So nothing's changed there. We underwrite new business to include appropriate pricing mechanisms, to protect us against hyperinflation or devaluation in certain markets. So in some cases, that means either bigger price escalators or more frequent pricing changes. And so we haven't changed the way that we run the business. We're not going to constrain our growth. We're going to continue to invest in a disciplined way and continue to run the plays that we've been running.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You guys are hard at work innovating on the Audio side, digital audio, international, but if I'm hearing you right, some of that probably isn't a big 2015 revenue opportunity. So Jamere, questions for you. What are you guys assuming in your guidance in terms of Audio growth or what type of headwind to your organic growth Audio's going to be?","Jamere Jackson","So what we've said in total was that Audience Measurement is going to be in the 5% to 6% growth rate range. That includes Audio. So if you think about where we've exited 2014, our Watch business x Audio is growing in the 6% ZIP code. When you combine Audio with that, that's gets you in the 5% to 6% ZIP code. So Audio is growing low single digits in the framework that we've given you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I'd be really interested in you guys talking about Europe and what you're seeing in the various countries in Europe in terms of softness in those markets more generally than just your products and whether you think '15 towards the end of the year will see some robustness in Europe. You guys have such have a unique seat. And then going back to this -- a prior question on the set top box data, I know that your philosophy, you've sort of articulated twice, is to integrate big datasets into the core products. But could you talk about, are you buying set top box data? And at the end of the day, do you have to buy all 26 million set top box households that are now available for purchase? And should we expect to see that sort of cost step up in your income statement as you integrate more set top box data into the big data attributes of these products?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Laura. First, on Europe, we're not expecting a big change in Europe relative to what we've seen over the last couple of years. That's the way we build it into our plans, and so that picture does improve. That would be good news to us, but we're not expecting it. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard executing a tough growth environment. They're finding some new pockets of growth. They continue to operate with a very high level of discipline from cost perspective, which is exactly what you need in that market. I was just in Europe a few weeks ago, spent some time with our Nielsen teams in both Germany and in France. And both of those markets, in fact, they have some very good things going on. They continue to innovate, especially around the new issues that have risen to the top of the agenda for clients in that market. How to compete more effectively and manage price more efficiently, for example, is one, and also how to be more efficient with the assortment of products that they bring to the shelf. And so we have some fantastic capabilities in those areas, and we're elevating those capabilities to try to be right on top of the agenda of what's most important to our clients. Turning to your set top box question for a moment, look, we already have access to quite a bit of set top box data. And we use it quite productively in our Nielsen Catalina Solutions business, which falls into our Marketing Effectiveness practice that's been a very strong performing part of our business. It leverages the set top box data in a analytical product that looks at what consumers view on television and then looks at those same consumers to see what they purchase in the store, connecting Watch and Buy, answering that marketing ROI question that's high on the agenda of nearly every CMO at the big CPG companies we work with. So we're already well familiar with set top box data. And we'll look to acquire more of it, of course, because it fits perfectly with our concept of what the future of measurement is all about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I actually just want to ask another question around OCR and VC and current market traction. I know you mentioned you have -- 19 of the 25 largest advertisers are using it. But I assume a lot of those brands would have adopted OCR earlier -- early on in its availability. I'm curious, big costs are going on all the time. I was just curious how you feel you're doing currently, how you monitor it, how your current market share trends are in terms of ongoing licensing to clients.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. We feel great about it, Brian. Thanks for the question. It was 18 when we had our Analyst Day in December, so we've moved up one notch to 19. We're going to continue to move up. We feel good. The 6 that -- on that list that we don't have, by the way, have not -- some -- not all of them have made up their mind yet. So it's not like we have 19, and somebody else has 6. We have 19, and there's a few maybe in the other guys' camp and a few that are still working on it. So we're going to keep working very hard on this front. And one of the other things that we feel really good about is when you talk to the power users, in particular at the big agency holding companies, you talk to the power users, the people who are really in the weeds in terms of understanding these products, understanding the underlying quality of them, the utility of them, power users almost to a person, they prefer OCR. They understand the strength of OCR, the quality of it. We feel good about that. That, in the long term, will be a really good support of our continued progress in this particular part of the market. But ultimately, again, it's -- this is an important component, OCR. And OCR is also a set of capabilities that inform a lot of other things we do both in Digital. It's part of the architecture for Digital Content Ratings. It's a key part of our overall total audience framework. In the longer term, as you go out more in time, total audience is really what the game is going to be.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. And I would add to that, Brian. The one thing that is a good sign for us, and we saw this as we had our operating reviews with the teams, is that many of the original deals that you referred to were all pretty short-term deals, and the renewals have been incredibly strong. And so that is a very encouraging sign that Mitch talked about is the adoption and the renewals combined so that we're doing very well in the marketplace today.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call back to CEO, Mitch Barns, for closing remarks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Laurel. Look, before we close, what I'd like to do is just briefly summarize, very briefly the key points we hope you all take away from the morning's call. I hope you find this to be helpful. So let me just walk through them. I'll do it very quickly.","First, I want you to hear it again: our business has fundamental strength. We're seeing broad-based double-digit growth in emerging markets, continued double-digit growth in our Marketing Effectiveness practice. Our e-commerce development is progressing well and is proving a great fit for our product portfolio.","We're succeeding through strategic value-added partnerships. It's core part of our operating philosophy, to partner with other world-class firms, firms like Alibaba, Adobe, Facebook, Intage, Tencent and more, and you're going to see more to come.","We're positioned incredibly well to leverage big data. The future of measurement is about combining our high-quality panels with highly granular big datasets to get the best of both worlds, and we're uniquely positioned to do this. We're already doing it with OCR, and we're extending that concept to the rest of our portfolio.","You're seeing continued strong growth in our Audience Measurement business. It's broad-based. It's led by OCR but also with our local business showing solid growth, as we mentioned.","And speaking of OCR, strong momentum, 19 of the top 25 advertisers. We are pleased that the major digital publishers are receiving or requesting or, even in some cases, requiring it. And our international expansion will add the 7 new markets this year, including China.","We're on track with our development of Digital Content Ratings via our Adobe relationship, and this one is going to be a game changer. And our total audience framework, it's perfectly aligned with what the market needs, independent third-party measurement following consumers no matter how, when or where they watch, bringing comparable currency grade ratings of both content and ads across all screens, platforms and ad models. That's what total Audience Measurement is about.","And even as we invest in growth, our strong business model enables us to return cash back to shareholders. It will be about $1.6 billion in cash back to shareholders over the next 1.5 years.","And finally, we have a strong team, teams full of energy, optimism. They're focused on executing and delivering in 2015. We're bullish on the year ahead.","So with that, I'll say thanks again for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking more with you soon.","Kathryn H.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to the host, Ms. Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Vanek, please proceed.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thank you so much. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's first quarter 2014 financial performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, CEO; Jamere Jackson, CFO; and Brian West, our COO. A slide presentation that we'll use on the call today is available under the Events section of our IR website at nielsen.com\/investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, as I always have to do, I need to remind you all that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, April 24, 2014. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties, both of which are outlined in our 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find, again, on our website.","For today's call, Mitch will start with some comments on our results for the quarter and an overview of the key highlights, and he will then provide an update on key growth catalysts that we have here at the company. Then Jamere will discuss financials for the quarter, and obviously touch on guidance as well. [Operator Instructions] And now, to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. We appreciate the opportunity to update you on our business.","Look, we had a great first quarter, with growth from all across our global client base and from all regions of the world. Let's walk through a high-level look at the numbers for the quarter.","First, revenue. Revenue grew a little better than 15% on a constant currency basis. If we exclude our acquisitions of Arbitron and Harris Interactive, the core top line growth was just under 5%. Watch side of our business had a strong second quarter, with -- grew just over 6%, and that reflects our increasing momentum in Digital and continued strong growth in Ad Solutions.","On the Buy side, growth came in just under 4%, driven by developing markets, client wins and steady, consistent performance in developed markets. Next, adjusted EBITDA. It was up 19.4% or just under 23% on a constant currency basis. And adjusted net income per share, it grew 48%, coming in at $0.43 for the quarter.","We continue to execute on the integration of Nielsen Audio and the positive impact from that is reflected in our numbers. Two other highlights for the quarter that I want to call to your attention: First, as many of you know, we recently executed a series of transactions in the debt markets, and those moves further strengthened our balance sheet and improved the economics of our debt structure. The moves were supportive of our long-term capital plan, which we continue to feel very good about.","Just as a reminder, our long-term capital plan follows a balanced approach. It starts with the dividend, which is a great fit with our steady, consistent business model. We'll continue to grow the dividend, at least in line with earnings. For our net debt leverage, we recently reset our target to the 3x area, and that gives us flexibility: flexibility for M&A, flexibility for share repurchases.","Separately, on the heels of another secondary offering by our private equity sponsors during the first quarter, approximately 75% of Nielsen's shares are now publicly held. And we're pleased to reiterate our guidance for 2014. So big picture, we're off to a good start to the year, well positioned to deliver steady, consistent growth on our core business throughout the rest of 2014 and beyond.","Now population growth and media fragmentation, these continue to be the big long-term trends that inform our growth strategies. Our response to both of these is coverage: coverage of what consumers watch and listen to, and coverage of what they buy. And then we connect the 2 sides. We connect what people watch with what they buy and we use that to help our clients improve the effectiveness of their marketing. These are things that every client needs and these are things we can do better than anybody else. Let's take a closer look at some of the specific efforts that we're working on against these objectives.","The first one is our investments in our Buy business focused on the key developing markets: China, India, Indonesia, Africa, Mexico, Brazil. We love markets with growing populations, a rising middle class and growing disposable incomes. We'll continue investing for growth in markets like these all day long. China is a great example, and I'm sure you've all seen stories in the press about growth slowing in China. But our business in China saw strong double-digit growth in the first quarter, driven by both local clients and multinationals.","Another source of strength for our Buy business are things that leverage our global presence and scale. One example we've been rolling out over the past year is a product called Global Track Complete. This product provides C-level executives at the headquarters of our largest global consumer packaged goods clients a simple and clear view of their sales volume and market share, harmonized globally but with the ability to drill down and see region, country or even city-level views. This really delivers on the promise of Nielsen's global presence. And our clients love it. It's one of the reasons why we're winning in our Buy business.","In our Watch business, we're making great progress on our audience measurement initiatives. TV, of course, remains the major platform and our franchise there continues to be rock solid. But the growth of digital video continues to build momentum. And as it does, the major digital players, they're increasingly aligning themselves with the metrics of the TV world. And they're doing this to meet the requirements of advertisers, who insist on the kind of independent, third-party measurement that Nielsen provides. We like this trend.","Our Online Campaign Ratings metric, or OCR, is perfectly in tune with where the market is going. And as a result, it continues to gain broader acceptance and its extension into mobile advertising, which continues to grow rapidly, is an important part of that.","You've seen some examples of our progress in this area in our recent announcements related to Google and Facebook in particular. We're also leveraging OCR's infrastructure to support our Digital Program Ratings metric, which is set for launch in Q2. And finally, one of our most important plays in this area will happen in July, with our full-scale launch of mobile video measurement, when mobile viewing of television content will begin to be included in the C3 currency metric that the market trades on, and we couldn't be happier with this one.","Next is e-commerce. This is truly one of the most exciting developing areas for our business these days. At its most basic level, you can think of e-commerce as another retail channel, and so we simply need to measure it for our coverage of what consumers buy. But e-commerce is developing into much more than just a retail channel. E-commerce providers are also playing a growing role as marketing platforms, driving off-line sales for brands, and they're converging with location-based marketing in terms of how consumers access and use them, especially from their mobile devices.","Ultimately, we predict that e-commerce will prove to be the perfect environment for the full range of Nielsen's Watch and Buy capabilities. And it's all digital, fueled by highly granular, real-time data. We're excited about our developing relationships with the likes of Alibaba, Tencent and Yihaodian in China; Amazon here in the U.S.; and a number of other e-commerce players around the world. A lot more to come on this one, so stay tuned.","I mentioned earlier the continued strong growth we're seeing in Advertiser Solutions. This is where Watch meets Buy in our business and the work we do here helps our clients improve the precision of their marketing. This trims waste from the system and significantly improves their marketing ROI. This aligns well with the objectives of CMOs at nearly all of our major CPG clients, but also with our media clients and clients in a number of other big verticals, including auto, financial services and retailing. We still see a lot of runway in this area, so our product development and business development efforts won't slow down one bit.","Finally, Nielsen Audio. I mentioned earlier that the integration and the resulting cost synergies are all on track. We're also making good progress on our growth initiatives. We recently presented our work linking radio advertising to its resulting sales impact at a big industry conference. And this is a great example of big data informing the effectiveness of a traditional form of media. The work we presented made a strong case for the ROI of radio advertising and it's being incredibly well received by the key industry players. We're also hard at work developing our Digital Audio measurement capabilities, which the market very much needs. And we've only just begun to develop the global growth opportunity for Audio.","I said at the outset that our strong first quarter is a result of our clear focus on our clients' key priorities. These efforts we've just walked through are examples of how we're responding to the opportunities that we see. We're confident in our choices, and we're confident that our success with these efforts will continue to drive our growth throughout 2014 and beyond. Given what the long-term trends say about where consumers and markets are heading, we're perfectly positioned for steady and consistent growth, both for today and into the future.","And now I'll turn it over to Jamere and he'll give you a deeper look at the numbers.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch. As Mitch indicated, we delivered a solid first quarter performance, reflecting strong execution and our proven business model. Revenue was roughly $1.5 billion, up 15.1% constant currency. Excluding the impact of Arbitron and Harris, revenues grew 4.8% constant currency.","Adjusted EBITDA was $376 million, up 22.9% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 25.3%, up a strong 160 basis points, due to the integration of Arbitron, operating leverage and good execution on our productivity initiatives. Adjusted net income was $165 million, up 48.6% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.43, up 48.3% versus prior year. Finally, we generated $13 million of free cash flow, up $28 million versus a year ago.","Next, on Page 9, I'll move to segment revenue and give you a little color on the pieces. Total Buy revenue was $837 million, up 5.9% in constant currency and up 3.9%, excluding the Harris acquisition. Our information business grew 4% to $656 million constant currency. We saw increased demand for our retail measurement services, pockets of strength in developing markets and the benefits of recent client wins in the developed markets.","Our Insights business was $181 million, up 13.8% constant currency, or up 3.8% excluding Harris, due to strengths in developing markets and modest growth in developed markets. Developing markets were up 7.6%, as we saw broad-based growth driven by our local clients and steady progress with our multinational clients as well. This growth continues to fuel our conviction in investing in coverage and capability to help our clients capitalize on the growth opportunities in these markets.","Finally, our Watch business was $652 million, up 29.4% constant currency, or 6.2% excluding Arbitron. As Mitch said, the Arbitron acquisition is progressing well. We saw a continued strength in audience measurement, which includes Digital, and we see double-digit growth in Ad Solutions. And as Mitch mentioned, our Digital initiatives continue to gain traction and we're pleased with the results we're seeing. Again, broad-based, solid revenue growth for the quarter.","Moving to profitability. Buy EBITDA was $118 million, up 1.7% constant currency. And there are 2 key drivers here: One, we continue to invest in a very disciplined way in developing market coverage to fuel long-term growth and support our clients. And two, we are investing in our platforms ahead of new client wins. We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic and explore only those investments that makes sense for our business and our clients, which in turn will be accretive to shareholders. We have a strong track record of investing through the cycles and monetizing these investments over the long term. On the Watch side, EBITDA grew 34.8% to $267 million constant currency, driven by the addition of the Arbitron business, and the scalability and operating leverage capability of our business model.","Flipping to Page 11. I want to remind you that we report on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We don't take on transactional risk. This is strictly the translation impact for reporting purposes. Hence, in the quarter, we saw foreign currency impacts that resulted in a 220-basis-points drag on revenue and a 350-basis-point drag on EBITDA, in the ballpark of what we laid out in our February call.","Separately, we took a $20 million charge related to revaluation impacts from the Venezuelan bolivar. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through the rest of the year, then the estimates you see here are the projected impact on future revenue and EBITDA. As we previously indicated, the anticipated drag based on today's rates is included in our full year ANI outlook and will be offset entirely by the acquisition -- Harris, and the accretion associated with it.","Moving to the balance sheet and some of the key financial metrics. On the top left, you see some of the key financial metrics. Note, we generated $13 million in free cash flow this quarter, up $28 million versus prior year, due to our solid operating performance and the benefit from lower interest expense.","On the bottom left is our pro forma net debt ratio. Our gross debt is $6.7 billion, with roughly $300 million in cash to get to $6.4 billion in net debt and a 3.6x ratio. On the capital table on the right, you can see that we've remixed our debt based on some of the recent refinancing options, which I'll cover in more detail on the next page. And based on these recent refinancing activities, our weighted average interest rate is approximately 4.25%, which remains largely unchanged.","On Page 13, a few comments on our capital structure. We have proactively addressed our capital structure and made great progress on extending maturities at attractive rates. Since our March 26 update, we've executed more than $4 billion of refinancing activities, with increased tenure by 2.4 years, at attractive rates that have significantly strengthened our balance sheet.","The refinancing has also resulted in a flatter maturity profile, with fewer peaks in any given year. We were able to secure investment-grade-like covenants and we received favorable reaction from the credit agencies. We still have a little juice left, as we turn our attention to the $800 million of 7 3\/4% notes that are callable in the second half of the year.","And as you can see on the bottom graph, after we refinanced the 2018 notes, we will not have any significant maturities until 2019. Importantly, as you know, we updated our net debt leverage target to the 3x area, which gives us tremendous flexibility to grow our business and return capital to our shareholders. We'll continue to update our capital structure, and I look forward to updating you on future earnings call.","Finally, on Page 14, we're reaffirming our 2014 guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 adjusted net income per share, with no changes to the underlying levers. However, in light of the recent refinancing activities, which I covered, we're -- it's going to be closer to the lower end of the net book interest range we provided. We're also reaffirming our full year free cash flow guidance of roughly $700 million.","So to wrap up, the year's off to a strong start, due to solid execution, the underlying strength of our business model and disciplined investments, all of which enable us to continue to deepen our relationships with our clients. And this puts us in a great position to continue to deliver strong return for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Kate.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks so much, Jamere. Operator, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess 2 questions, the first for Mitch specifically. You mentioned a little bit of this in conjunction with your comments around e-commerce, and even a little bit around the acquisition, at the time, of Harris. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your extension into other verticals, and how you see that progressing. You have a little tiny toehold in it, and maybe with the Harris? And how do you see that developing over time, early results? The second question is more, I guess, on the operating leverage on the Buy side. We -- I think you've made it clear what the investment strategy is, and it makes a tremendous amount of sense. But no good deed goes unpunished. I was wondering if I could push a little further to see if we can get a little bit more visibility in terms of the timing of kind of a return to a little bit stronger operating leverage gains in that business?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, thanks, David. All right, let's start with your first question, where you're asking about extension to other verticals. First, to step back from that, we're always first and fully focused on the core verticals that we serve. The core verticals for us, of course, being consumer packaged goods and media. So we always start there. Our Ad Solutions business, though, which of course is focused just as much on those 2 verticals, is one of those great places that the capabilities in Ad Solutions are just as useful, just as important, just as valuable to advertisers across a whole number of verticals. And so that's one of the most natural places for our business to serve a lot of these other verticals: auto, financial, retail in particular, are some that we've been especially active in lately. And then, yes, to your point, of course, our work with Harris just simply adds to that, and e-commerce takes you into a lot more verticals as well. But we continue to stay focused on those core verticals and then let the sort of the natural development happen in those other verticals, primarily through our Ad Solutions business right now.","On the Buy business, the thing I always want to go back to here is these developing markets have such great underlying fundamentals, but they're developing over the longer term: population growth, rise of the middle class, rising incomes, and in some of these markets also, urbanization. And these things will play out over, not just the next couple of quarters, but we're really talking about several years, and even decades. And that's the way we approach these markets. So we invest for that longer term.","Second thing to remind you is we invest in multiple ways here. So initially we go into a market, we gain broad coverage of the market so that there is broad understanding of sales and market share performance for our clients. And increasingly over time, they push us to go to subsequent ways of investment to provide more granularity of the market, city-level views, channel-specific views and additional views like that. And so that's the way these markets tend to develop over time, and we'll invest like that all day long because again, each wave of that investment produces a good return for us and the long-term opportunity in these markets is fantastic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Buy information. I was intrigued about the acceleration here in the first quarter just reported. The year-ago comp is still a bit tough there. It's still a part of the new Walmart product ramp a year ago. And so I wanted you to go a little bit deeper into, say, increased global demand for retail measurement. What does that mean? Is it related to the comment that Mitch said about the Global Track Complete product? And more importantly, heading into second quarter, where the comp gets a lot easier, should Buy information accelerate further?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well yes, thanks, Andrew. We do feel great about our Buy business. We have momentum on a number of fronts: momentum in the developing markets, momentum in terms of new client wins, and yes, we do see momentum in terms of global demand. Our Buy business too, another thing to just try to highlight for you is we have the measurement side of our business and the analytics side of our business, and we do well on both of those fronts. But increasingly, what we see from the big global clients is they want to go deep in terms of integrating the measurement side of our business and the analytics side of our business, and that really plays to our strength in the Buy business. Because if they want to have deep link -- linkage between measurement and analytics, then that's perfect for Nielsen. Our broad portfolio, we tie those 2 things together to drive more value. It also gives them a more forward-looking view of their business, to help them find the growth opportunities in the markets, whether it's developing or developed markets. And that's one of the reasons why our client relationships are growing stronger and broader at the same time. That's one of the reasons why we're winning clients. And yes, Global Track Complete that I mentioned earlier is a part of that, but it's only one of several parts in the reason why our Buy business is showing so much strength right now.","Brian J. West","The only thing, Andrew, I would add to that is that, in terms of your question about the forward, we haven't seen broad-based acceleration. But to Mitch's point, we're just seeing nice, steady consistency between the full offering to our clients, whether it's the measurement or the analytics. And that feels great and we'll take 4% any day of the week.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But the year-over-year comp matters, right? It gets a lot easier?","Brian J. West","Yes, you know what though, as Mitch said, is that we're starting to necessarily see comps one quarter versus another versus info versus Insights. More and more, clients are really talking about trying to increase their level of investments, increasing their demand for our tools, and overall, Buy growing a little faster feels good and a point matters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Following up on that, could you give us an update on what you're seeing in Europe? It's been a drag, and I'm wondering if there's any potential easing there that might have contributed to the almost 4% organic growth in Buy?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, look our outlook on Europe really hasn't changed: flat, plus or minus 1 somewhere. That's still the way we are planning for our year to unfold. I was in Europe just last week. I was in our U.K. business in particular. And while we're not changing our longer-term outlook for what we should expect in Europe, I can say that there's more life and optimism and energy right now in Europe than what I've seen in the recent past. The team -- in fact, the office environment, if I can talk about inside baseball here, our Nielsen office environment would rival the office environment of Nielsen anywhere else in the world, including the developing markets right now. They just feel good. I think it's partly that maybe things have stabilized a little bit now. They're out there hunting, and in our U.K. business in particular, a little bit different, maybe, from the rest of Europe. They are getting some wins right now and they put together a few good quarters of some growth here and there. So yes, we feel a little bit better about it, but we're not really changing our outlook for it right now.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then turning to Digital. There have been a number of announcements recently around Google partnerships with you and with comScore, and a number of products that are being rolled out. Could you maybe just walk us through the latest, in particular the activity with Google? And to any extent that you can distinguish what you're doing versus what comScore is doing, I think that would be helpful.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, sure, Sara, thanks. Well, the bigger picture here, we said it a quarter ago, when we were with you all on this call, that the bigger picture here, the good news is that the market, Google in particular, continues to open itself up to third -- independent third-party measurement, the kind of independent third-party measurement that Nielsen provides. And we think that's a good trend for the overall market, not just us, of course. And the reason why that's happening is primarily because advertisers are insisting on it. They are. And they're insisting on having the same kind of metric in the digital world that they have enjoyed for a long time in the TV world, and so that's why these digital players increasingly are aligning themselves in the digital world, with the metrics of the TV world, so that there's comparability across the choices that advertisers have. And so that to us is a very positive trend, certainly for our business. And that's what is really behind, to a very large extent, what you've seen in terms of the developments with Google.","We initially announced our agreement with Google with regard to YouTube back in November of last year, went through beta mode and now, moving out of beta into full-scale mode. And so OCR tagging for their premium content on YouTube will now just be a normal thing, and so that's incredibly positive for us. And then also, OCR integration into their DoubleClick platform, to make it as simple and seamless for advertisers as possible it could be, is also very positive for our business.","And on the Facebook front, we're also obviously a very big part of their advertising growth, in particular with mobile. They've called that out. I think they even called that on -- that out on their own earnings call yesterday, in terms of how they view Nielsen OCR and the role that it plays in terms of putting them on a level playing field with the TV world for advertisers, and that's the game they want to play. So again, we think OCR is perfectly positioned for where the market is going. And we're very happy with the momentum that we continue to gain and the broader and broader acceptance that we continue to build in the marketplace. And it's part of that broader audience measurement strategy that we have and that we feel great about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mitch, when you talked about the e-commerce opportunity, you mentioned your relationship with Amazon. I'm just curious, can you talk about the nature of this relationship and has anything changed there?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","It's a relationship that's been around for a while. We work with them in a number of fronts, helping them with their business questions, like we do with a lot of our clients. And that relationship will continue to grow and build over time. They are, as I mentioned, very much like a lot of the other e-commerce players. They are not just a retail outlet; they're also an advertiser. And so we have capabilities that can help advertisers, of course. They also are a video platform, with Amazon Prime video, and so we have opportunity to help them in terms of their decisions that they might make there. Similar with that, Amazon -- we deal with a lot of the other e-commerce players in a very broad way, not just in terms of retail measurement. And we're really still at the very early stages of these relationships, very early stages. So we're excited about how much opportunity there really still is out there.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and this is the first quarter in a while you haven't mentioned the Twitter TV Ratings. I'm just wondering how that's progressing? And do you expect that to be meaningful at some point from a revenue perspective?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well look, social for us is going great. It's big, almost 1 billion tweets about TV in 2013, is a stat that our social group just put out not too long ago. We're now involved with -- more than 90% of the TV networks using our service; agencies, our relationships with agencies in this area growing, too. Got more than 90 clients signed on. New capabilities rolling out. We're also expanding to other markets around the world. We announced expansion plan for Italy and Australia, which will happen later this year. And I think you'll see Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings playing a bigger role this year than ever before, of course, in the upcoming TV upfronts. So we're very happy about it in terms of it addressing a very important area for our clients. They're very curious about the role social, in particular Twitter, in terms of the impact it can have on their programming, on their ratings, and also what they can learn from it to make decisions for the future. And so that's what we're doing in this part of the business, is we're addressing an area of great curiosity and great opportunity for our clients. And it's natural for Nielsen to do that, given our historical role in TV.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd [indiscernible] with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A question on share count, then a quick follow-up on Buy. Just on the share count side, it looks like you kicked in the use of your buyback this quarter. So good to see that. But on top of that, the shares did creep up a little bit, not just from the convert, I think, but probably from some new shares issued. So if you could just talk about the progression of how you see that playing out over the year in terms of dilution and then offsetting that dilution from the buyback and what we should expect from that in terms of the use of cash?","And then the quick follow-up on Buy, a lot of this has been asked, but I'm just -- I'm really particularly interested in -- I know there was a new -- a big new customer win I think that you cited. I'm just wondering how much was that a contributor generally to the acceleration we saw in the core Buy business. If you could dimensionalize the importance of that versus other just strengths, that would be great.","Brian J. West","Todd, I'll help out with the share count question. The fourth quarter was up 5% on a GAAP basis. And that really wasn't creep. That was -- 3 points is just the impact you have to adjust for related to the mandatory convert. When you adjust for that, the fourth quarter was under 2%. Last year, it was under 1.5%. The first quarter is under 1.5%. And that is pretty consistent. And as you mentioned, we got this opportunity around the buyback that we could lean more heavily in over time with all the capital priorities that we've mentioned. So I'm glad you asked that question. I want to make sure there's no confusion out there. So that, we really don't see that impact as \"creep,\" it really is just an adjustment we have to work our way through. And as you probably know, we disclosed that in the release, in the appendices in the press release and the 10-K filings. So it's just one of those things that we'll work our way through, through the course of this year. But it will be over by the time we exit this year, because the comp issue will be behind us.","Jamere Jackson","Yes, I think the other thing is, we haven't changed our guidance in terms of what we put out there in terms of weighted average diluted shares. And as you mentioned, we did have some pretty good progress in the quarter. We bought back about 350,000 shares as part of our buyback. So pretty good progress there and we're executing on the strategy that we laid out.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","And Todd, I'll take your question on the Buy business. Yes, again the bigger picture here, we continue to feel great about our Buy business momentum across the world, momentum in terms of these client wins. The client win that you asked about that we mentioned last quarter was Mars, where we extended our relationship with them across a number of additional markets around the world and that's now very active. We're working with them to drive growth in their business every day now, and we feel great about that. But it's an example of a broader slate of client wins that our teams are out there battling for and succeeding with every single day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I was wondering, can you talk about the growth of Ad Solutions in the quarter? And separately I guess, or maybe relatedly, I was wondering how you think alternative data guarantees being used in the upfront, maybe using that or using Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings or anything else? But does that make any difference for you financially? Or do you see it more as just helpful in entrenching the existing relationships and product traction that you have?","Jamere Jackson","Well, I'll take your question on Ad Solutions, and I'll let Mitch address the guarantees piece of it. Ad Solutions continues to trend very, very well for us. We continue to see it as a key growth driver in the Watch business. And growth in the quarter was at the low end of the double-digit range. So again, very strong growth on Ad Solutions. We feel good about its contributions to the Watch business at this point.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","On the guarantees in the upfronts, it's still underpinned, of course, by the ratings. And then we haven't seen anything changing on that anytime soon, of course. That's just where the market continues to be focused. But I think increasingly, it's multilayered. So it's the ratings, and then there's an additional layer where they'll look at characteristics that might come from our Ad -- some of our Ad Solutions capabilities, brand effect, for example, might look at some of our Watch, Buy connection-type capabilities as well. And then also social plays a role into it as well, programs that are associated with higher levels of social media activity, more tweets online. It will be a tiebreaker or an enhancement in terms of how somebody will view that underlying rating. And that's the way the market increasingly is playing. So the ratings still underpins it and the other things sort of add color and allow people to make choices between things that otherwise might look pretty similar, just on the basis of the core age, gender rating metric.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Sure, I guess I'm just wondering, do you get paid more if there are more guarantees being used? Or is it more you're getting paid in the context of just the overall annual use of the products?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, to the extent that our clients see value in those services, that provide those additional layers, that's where it would add some growth to our business. And so, yes, to some degree, that contributes to the development of our Nielsen Social business and also the development of our Ad Solutions business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Bird with FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","My first question is for Brian. Could you talk about your new role as COO? Your perspective on your first 90 days? And your key priorities? Then I have a follow-up.","Brian J. West","Sure, Bill. So for me personally, it's an opportunity to look under the hood. And when you look under the hood, you feel better and better about this business and unique abilities that we enjoy. And the angle is one that I'm having fun with. Priority wise, look, client delivery is job 1, right? Making sure we can have a consistent, high-quality, on-time product is something we ought to keep focus on. We do a great job. Because when you do that well, then you get to go work on innovation and investments and we have a full plate of programs that we're working hard on to deliver and execute as we find those vital consumers and try to characterize them on behalf of our clients, because ultimately, what's going to drive the growth. And then finally, leadership development side, I get to work with our great team. They truly are the highest-caliber folks in the industry and that's fun -- creating opportunities for them and giving them fun stuff to work on. So I'm completely fired up and I'm learning a ton.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And a follow-up for Mitch, anything to read into the slight growth moderation we saw in Insights?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, look, we love our Insights business. It is the choppier side of our Buy business though. Information tends to be a little bit more stable. Insights tends to move around a little bit more quarter-to-quarter. But the longer-term trend on Insights is still great within our business. And again, as I mentioned earlier, I think in response to a question from Sara, clients increasingly want us to link the information Insights part of our business more closely and more deeply, and that just plays to Nielsen's strengths and the breadth of our portfolio. So yes, that's what I would say about Insights.","Brian J. West","Another angle, Bill, just because Andrew asked something similar, is this phenomenon Mitch has mentioned, clearly is happening. At the same time, we exited last year with one where they were investing, investing a little heavily in the analytics and not as much in the info. And this quarter actually, they're investing in some data sets that is helping drive their growth questions. So like you said, it's a mix. We enjoyed some nice Insights lift. We probably saw a little pop at our info, based on off-the-shelf data sets. But overall, our Buy business growing at 4% is one we're really proud of.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And in developing markets, do you have any broader perspective on, I guess, how the business feels in that part of the world? Any insight on whether the quarter strengthened throughout? Or any change in trend we should expect coming up in developing markets?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Sure. Well, I was just in China 2 weeks ago and once again reminded what's true in China is true in a lot of these developing markets. Our business is still very under-penetrated in these markets. So I know a lot of times, people see the GDP numbers and they think that, that -- our business is going to be tightly correlated to changes in GDP. But it's just really not very much the case at all, because of this under-penetration that our business still has in these markets. There's still lots of opportunities out there. And the other thing is the strength of our business with the local companies, not just the multinationals, but the local companies in these markets. And again, China's a great example where the local companies are actually winning against their global competitors. And it's something that the local companies are very proud of and the multinationals are very much aware of. And it's a very active topic of conversation with CEOs with the multinationals in the China market. In fact, I had some of those conversations while I was there. So the fact that our client base stretches across the multinationals and the local companies, that helps our growth in these markets. True in China, true in India, true in Southeast Asia and a lot of these developing markets as well. But again, the under-penetration is the opportunity for us to continue to grow, even when the overall market growth rate that you might read about in the press might move up or down quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess my first question is on Nielsen Audio, the potential revenue synergies that you're looking at now that the cost synergies are sort of behind you. Could you give us maybe a timeline for things such as international potential, maybe going after clients such as Pandora, things like that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Sure, Ashwin. Look, we're still very early in terms of pursuing the top line growth opportunities for our Audio business. Our focus initially was on integration, realizing cost synergies, and we've done very well executing on that front. We're still relatively early in terms of our development of some of the growth opportunities. I mentioned a few of them in my opening comments, global being one of them. But in global, one of the things to note there is in a lot of these markets, the radio measurement service is managed through joint industry committees, or JICs as they're often known, they're usually multiyear contracts. And so while we now have a global role to play in that market, those contracts don't necessarily all come up each year. You have to wait for some of them to come up in those markets. So it's a little bit longer-term play and it'll be a little bit slower to develop on the global front.","On Digital Audio measurement, exciting thing there is we're able to leverage our OCR capability, get even more value out of that fantastic capability that we have, and bring that to Digital Audio measurement and the market very much wants it and needs it. But it's similar in audio as it is in video, in that there's a role that Nielsen plays and then there's some things that clients also need to do to make the whole thing work. One of them is to incorporate our code, if you will, into their apps. And then the market also needs to align around how the metric will be reported out to the market. And there's often winners and losers in that process and it takes some time to play out. And so that's where we are on that one. And so one way of saying don't really have a clear timeline or specific numbers to give you on the growth front. We like where it's going. We think we're doing all the right things, we're getting all the right feedback from the marketplace, so stay tuned.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","God it. The second question is just back to the Buy business. And you guys have done over the last 2, 3 years, actually longer, but it's been more focused, it seems like, on the developing country side. And wanted to understand better how the economics of a typical developing-country client contract works relative to the multinationals? I mean, from a profitability standpoint, I guess I would expect them to be smaller currently. What kind of products do they take up, things like that. If you could have some comments, that'd be useful.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Are you referring to the local companies in these markets? Is that what you're asking about, Ashwin?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, the local companies.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, that one's evolving. Look, we -- first thing to say is we serve all -- we serve an entire market. We don't serve just one part of the market. We think that's very important to the way Nielsen is viewed in the marketplace, so we have to serve the entire market, not just one client or not just one segment of clients. And so the local clients are a big part of that story. In some of these developing markets, they're evolving, I think, in terms of how they operate, whether they're operating according to local standards, international business standards, and we need to be right there with them at whatever stage of development that they're in. Initially, our experience with local clients is that their needs start out being fairly basic. They want just basic measurement of the marketplace. But over time, our relationships with them develops and looks very much like it does with the global players, where they want to get involved with some of the analytics capabilities, things that help them not just measure their performance, but also improve their performance over time. And then what I would say about what we see in the most recent year or 2 is more and more of these larger local giants within the developing markets, we're seeing more of the people that we knew from the multinationals in those markets now showing up in leadership roles at these local companies. And that, of course, is a -- it's a positive for us, because these are people that are familiar with Nielsen, familiar how to access the value that we can provide. And I think it's one of the reasons why our business has performed so well with the local giants in the developing world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mobile measurement sounds like it's one of the biggest issues on clients' minds these days. And could you walk us through the Nielsen solutions in that area and where they are in the adoption cycle? And how they're going to fit into the audience measurement landscape this fall?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, the broader audience measurement picture, of course, is we measure the consumer. So we're not measuring -- we're not thinking about measuring just one channel, like mobile or online or just TV. We measure the consumer and we're going to measure the consumer wherever, however, and whenever the consumer is accessing content, whether that's video, audio or text. Mobile is obviously a growing and important part of that. Our OCR capability is, again, perfectly positioned to help us on that front. And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much momentum in the marketplace right now. Mobile video, in particular, is a hot area of focus. And as we mentioned, our mobile video measurement capability will roll out full-scale starting in July, and the television viewing portion of that viewing -- of that content will begin to be included in the C3 currency metric that the market trades on starting in the fall. And so, yes, we're in everywhere we need to be in terms of mobile measurement and we're getting great feedback from the marketplace and from the clients, and it fits perfectly into our broader audience measurement strategy.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then the CPG companies seem to cycle between emphasizing revenue growth and emphasizing margin preservation. Could you comment on where we are in that cycle and how it's impacting the Insights business?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, I think you should ask them. They're probably the better voice on this. But I think your question's a good one, and we do see a little bit of a swing in the broader market right now, with variance across specific clients. But I think there was a heavy leaning in the last couple of years into, call it, efficiency. And now people are leaning a little bit more into the things that are going to drive a little bit more top line growth for them going forward. And that's natural, the swings back and forth in the marketplace. Some things are being written right now about a little bit less focus on scale and allowing a little bit more variation in the business in order to pursue that top line growth opportunity. That's going to play to our advantage, because of the ways that our portfolio looks and feels to clients and what it helps them do in terms of finding those growth opportunities, helping improve their performance in the market. And so we're ready for them whenever they're ready to do it.","Brian J. West","Another angle on that, Bill, is that before, several quarters, when you would go talk to a client, the thing on the top of their mind probably was some uncertainty they couldn't control: a regional meltdown, a fiscal policy, an election, a financial crisis. Now what's on top of their mind? Growth. And that's good for them and long term, good for us, and it's a different conversation, and it's fun.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I know you're not going to give us any numbers, but I'm just curious, again, on OCR. Moving into the upfront season here, you signed up Google and Facebook. I know you've had customers like ESPN, for example, for some time. How much could you say does this become more of a contributor to your P&L now during the upfront season, as presumably with some of the big gorillas in the industry starting to use it, that should attract others, both competitors, as well as their customers, the advertisers, to the platform. And separately but relatedly, could you just talk a little bit more about your Digital Program Ratings? How much of that is a support mechanism for OCR and TV Ratings versus a new separate product that you'll be selling?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, Tim, well, the -- on your first question, we said that our core Watch growth is 6.2% and the role that Digital plays is not just -- there's not just a Digital slice. Digital is part of the overall business picture for us, because even our traditional media clients, one reason why our business is strong and healthy with our traditional media clients, who are primarily focused on television, is that they have confidence in what we're doing on the Digital front. And so they continue to invest with us so that we can continue to do what's important for their future growth. So it even has a -- Digital and what we're doing with OCR plays a broader role than just the specific purchases of the OCR service itself. So that's the way we think about it. That's the way I would encourage all of you to think about it as well. And one of the reasons why our core Watch business did so well in the first quarter.","On DPR, it is -- yes, it is a complementary metric to OCR, in that DPR is measuring content, OCR is focused on the ads or the campaigns. One's used more for the planning phase and the other is used more for the post-buy and the guarantee aspect of the advertising process. And the 2 fitting together so well completes the system, allows each of them to become more valuable when they're both present in the marketplace, as opposed to if it's only one or the other. And that's the way the marketplace sees it and that's exactly what we're going after -- exactly what we're going after, too. But you're right, no numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I actually just had a quick question on margins. We saw a pretty significant year-over-year expansion, larger than we've historically seen. How should we think about that as we go through the year? I think if we extrapolated the 140 basis point expansion over the rest of the year, it put us at the upper end of the 29% to 30% guidance range. Are there any onetime elements that we should be thinking about, the impact of integrating Harris or the Buy-side expansion? Any of that stuff that can kind of put us at the upper versus the lower end?","Jamere Jackson","Yes, so we feel pretty good about what we've laid out in terms of guidance this year. And we see the margin progress as we go through the year being pretty steady. As I said in my comments, we're seeing the benefits of a couple of things: One, obviously the integration of Arbitron and the progress that we're making on the synergies there. But we're also making very good progress on executing on some of the productivity initiatives and that bodes very, very well for the margin story that we have. So feel pretty good with where we are, and we'll see steady progress throughout the year and don't expect any major onetimers to swing it one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Adrienne Colby for Paul Ginocchio. Beyond the July rollout of the mobile video measurement, what other milestones should we be looking for in terms of the development of your measurement footprint going forward?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","So thinking broadly about audience measurement, I think another thing to look for is, we had a question asked before about Audio coming into that picture. If we want to focus on the video or the tech side of the world, I think the growing role that these measurements play, that we provide in the upfronts, the new fronts and then how that plays out in the fall season, and then how to roll into next year, where you'll see the, I think again, just another step change forward in terms of how digital world will continue to increasingly align itself more broadly, more deeply with these metrics that look more like what the TV world has traditionally used. And you're just going to see it really become much more of a video market as opposed to a separate TV -- traditional TV and then digital market. And I think that's what we would expect to happen, and I think that our strategy is perfectly positioned for where the market wants to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just following up on Andre's question. Jamere, if I look at the Watch EBITDA growth and take out the Arbitron impact, both in terms of what they grew at and the synergies, is it fair to say that Watch EBITDA was sort of up high-single digit on a pro forma basis? And that -- and if you trickle that down to total EBITDA, the total EBITDA, x the Arbitron impact, was up about mid-single digit for the company. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Jamere Jackson","Well, we don't look at the business that way. We've been hard at work sort of wiring the place together, if you will, on the Arbitron acquisition. And so what you'll see is that we, again, made very steady progress on integrating the business. We're continuing to see steady-margin progress, which we've historically been accustomed to at our -- in our Watch business. And you're seeing the benefit of the execution on the productivity initiatives that we've been working on throughout the year. So in total, we feel good about where our margins are and how they're progressing and we feel very good about our execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Mitch, I just had kind of a big picture question, similar to a few that have been asked here about how you sell your products. And so just in the context, say, of the Watch business, obviously, with a lot of the new Digital products, you're selling those into your current large customers, large media customers that you've had for a long time, but also some new clients. Some of them are big players like a Google, where I'm sure it's still a high-touch, hands-on sort of relationship. But obviously what Digital does in the media world is bring fragmentation in the long tail. And so especially as we talk about things like currency adoption and whatnot, how do you think about selling into that say, longer group of smaller clients, the long tail of the media ecosystem that builds out as Digital takes over? And I think the question could apply to the Buy business as well, as the role of e-commerce changes the way you sell your products there as well?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, fragmentation, I guess, is the driver of the basis for your question. And fragmentation, whether it's in the Watch part of the world for us or the Buy part of the world, it's our friend. It creates opportunity for us. It means there are more things to measure. And then there's a need to stitch all those things together, so basically, you have more ways to add value into the marketplace. And so that's the way we approach it.","In terms of a long tail of clients being out there, where it's the big clients or whether it's smaller or medium-sized clients in the longer tail, we always start with the client need. We focus on the client need, make sure we understand their business and then we organize ourselves around that. Obviously, we have to do that in a way that makes economic sense and also fits with the business process for whoever the client happens to be.","In the Buy side of our business, we've been doing this for a long time, where we do have big global clients that we work with, but we work with a lot of smaller players and we have a different business approach that we take there. And it's very healthy, very fast-growing part of our business year-to-year. And we're able to do that on the Watch side of our business, too, within the digital world. It's a different approach, necessarily so, but it's one that fits with what the client need is and with the economics of those relationships.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And so as that transition plays out over a long period of time, one of the things that I thought stuck out from your Investor Day was the Nielsen Marketplace initiative, where building more server-to-server, API-driven delivery of your information products. Is that a type of thing that, again, over a longer-term perspective, that'll start to become more important?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","It could. But that one's still pretty early in terms of development right now, so too soon to say exactly what role that might play. And I think Nielsen Marketplace is probably focused on people who might draw value from the kind of information we have that really even aren't in our current client base right now. That's more what we're focused on with Nielsen Marketplace. But yes, it's possible that it might also have applicability to the clients that we're already currently working with. We'll see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On Nielsen Audio, specifically on Arbitron, I know you haven't quantified revenue synergies specifically. But maybe give us a sense of what the timing of that looks like. You had spoken about using your global footprint to go after non-U.S. listeners, as well as some other stuff. Maybe just update us on how we should think about that progress?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, one that's already active is the one I mentioned, where we've presented some of our initial R&D work at a big industry conference, where we're linking the radio advertising activity to its resulting sales impact in the marketplace. That capability is already live. It's already one that an increasing number of clients are interested in and starting to tap into, so that's that one.","As far as the global opportunities, I mentioned earlier a lot of these markets around the world manage the radio measurement market through Joint Industry Committees, long-term contracts. And so there's a bit of a waiting game in some of these markets for the contract to come up for RFP. And then we will make our pitch and we will win some of those. But it'll happen and develop over several-year period, as opposed to something that you should expect to really start to play a meaningful role in 2014 for us.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, and just to follow up. Within the Buy segment, could you give us a high-level sense of what the growth rate looks like for local clients versus multinationals? Are local clients growing high-single digit? Are multinationals growing low-single digits? Any overall sense you can give us? And any sense of change of tone on the multinational side versus last quarter?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","It varies a lot market by market, client by client. We've said before that in China last year, if you think about our business with local clients versus multinationals, we grew a lot more with local clients in China last year than we did with multinationals. I can't remember the exact numbers, but it was certainly high-double digits with the locals and mid-singles with the multinationals. And that will probably look something like that again this year, and you'll see a similar pattern in some of the other markets. But it does vary quite a bit market to market, and that's the way our business looks with them. If you look at how their business is performing in the marketplace, it's similar, right? They are gaining market share. They are growing and a lot of it is because they aren't trying to take a scale play into the market. They're really much more in tune with some of the local market variation. For example, in a market like China, it is incredibly diverse, that market is. And the local players are just a little bit better tuned to the diversity in that market and are able to take advantage of some of the growth opportunities more quickly. They're more agile than some of the global players are. The global players are learning from it though, they'll catch up. And I think you'll see this balance out over time, because there's smart people across all of these clients, and it's really fun to be a part of it and really fun to watch it unfold.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You guys are obviously making a lot of progress in the market with new deals around OCR and you started calling out Digital audience measurement in terms of a revenue needle mover. You were kind enough to give us a framework for how you're thinking about the multiyear opportunity in terms of revenue around OCR and the related products. I was wondering if you could give us a similar framework for how we should think about incremental margins as that comes online, given that you've already made a lot of the investment?","Brian J. West","Let me take a shot at that one. The beauty of the space around Digital is that from a margin standpoint, and your question is that, largely investment is behind us. So the incremental return in drop-in [ph] rates will be high. And as you can hear from Mitch, the momentum in the marketplace gets better and better.","More broadly speaking I would say, I'd also point out the fact that, that opportunity is going to unfold over the next few years, right, so some of those targets were in the 2017 time frame that we're excited to go after. I would just remind you and everybody that we laid out a pretty specifically framework for revenue growth at the beginning of the year of the piece and the components, more transparency than we ever given. And the good news is that things like Digital and Ad Solutions are helping us get to the higher end on the Watch business. In the Buy business, there's some things that are going some high, some low, kind of ending up in the middle. And that's a good spot for us, because it's more fun to be showing a close to 5% growth rate than a 4% growth rate. So we have a long year to go ahead in front of us. We're confident, but all of those things together, I think, are just going to be continuing momentum for us.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and then you said more to come after talking about e-commerce. And you also said that shortly after wrapping up the e-commerce section with the Amazon commentary. Was that comment meant to imply more to Amazon, more to e-commerce generally, or both?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","How about neither? How about that? No, I think we fully expect to have very positive developments across a number of areas that we're working on with a variety of players in e-commerce. And I wouldn't -- I would encourage you not to just focus on the big player in the U.S. There's big and very active, very successful players in the e-commerce world in other markets, China is a great example. And we're confident that we're going to have very exciting things to share on a number of fronts related to e-commerce in the months and years ahead.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's second quarter financial performance. Joining me on today's call is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer; and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Feel free to join the queue again, and if time remains, we will call on you.","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Good morning, everyone, I want to open the call with a few words about two announcements we made this morning not pertaining to our quarterly results.","First, as you probably have seen, I plan to retire from the company at the end of this year. Until then, I'll be actively engaged in running the business day to day along with Jim Attwood, our newly named Executive Chairman, who's been on the Nielsen Board of Directors for the past 12 years. Jim will also oversee the board's search for my successor.","I spent the majority of my career at Nielsen, starting more than 20 years ago in our BASES business. I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend my career. Although the company is going through a challenging time, the fact is we have two great franchises, Watch and Buy, and we are the undisputed global leaders of measurement and analytics in the media and fast-moving consumer goods industry. It's been a privilege to lead this great company in such a transformative period in its 95-year history and to have the opportunity to work with such talented colleagues around the world.","We have an outstanding leadership team that, with strong support from our board, is committed to driving forward our strategic priorities, including Total Audience Measurement, the Connected System and the transformation of our operations function.","In parallel with these strategic priorities, the board of directors, together with management, is conducting an in-depth strategic review of our Buy segment. We're committed to driving sustainable, long-term, incremental value for shareholders. The board doesn't have a fixed timetable for the review, nor has it made any decisions yet at this time. We recognize this is a significant piece of news and that you might have questions. However, this is all we have to say on this for now, and we'll provide updates when further disclosure is deemed appropriate.","Jamere is on the call with me today as usual, and I'll now turn it over to him to review our results. Before doing so, I'd like to thank you for your trust and investment in Nielsen. Jamere?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Mitch. And before I get started, I just wanted to say congratulations on your retirement and thank you for your tremendous contribution to the company. We've been incredibly blessed to have you as a leader, and you'll certainly be missed.","Let me jump into our results. The second quarter was one of the most challenging quarters for our business in over a decade. We are disappointed with our performance. We're sharply focused on our initiatives across Watch, Buy and Operations to drive improved results and long-term shareholder value.","In our Buy segment, revenue remains weak as a result of the increasingly challenging fast-moving consumer goods environment. In our Watch segment, our core measurement business remains strong. However, the changing data privacy landscape has caused a near-term deceleration in our Marketing Effectiveness momentum.","The strength of our franchises in Watch and Buy remains intact, providing our clients with mission-critical measurement and analytics to drive their business decisions. However, given our results in the second quarter and our second half outlook, we are resetting our guidance for 2018.","Let's start with the total company performance in the quarter. On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.65 billion, up 20 basis points on a reported basis, driven by growth in our Watch segment and a 90 basis points foreign currency benefit offset by continued weakness in our Buy segment.","Net income was $72 million, and net income per share was $0.20, down from $0.37 a year ago. Our net income per share results were driven by restructuring charges of $0.12 a share and higher spending to support our growth and cost-out initiatives across Watch and Buy. The restructuring charges reflect our continuing efforts to right-size the company to reflect the current market realities and accelerate our cost-out initiatives.","Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was down 70 basis points constant currency and on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $468 million, down 8.2% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.4%, down 232 basis points on a constant currency basis. Margins were impacted by softer revenue and continued investments in our Watch and Buy segments. This was partly offset by our productivity initiatives.","Free cash flow was $124 million, down from a record $162 million a year ago. This was primarily driven by lower net income and higher CapEx investments, partially offset by improved working capital management.","Next, I'll move to the segments, starting with Watch. The key takeaway is that the fundamentals of our Watch segment remain strong. This includes strong growth in Audience Measurement of Video and Text, the core of our Watch franchise. However, we are seeing some short-term pressure from GDPR and privacy changes that are impacting our second quarter results and our 2018 outlook.","Revenue was $858 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis and on an organic basis. Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 6.7% constant currency and organically led by strength in Total Audience Measurement, National TV, and Digital Ad Ratings. Gracenote had a particularly strong quarter driven by strong volume growth and is up significantly in the first half.","We've continued to make great progress on advancing Total Audience Measurement. The investments that we made in this strategy since 2015 continue to serve us well as the media ecosystem evolves. Despite the changes in the markets we serve, the need for independent, comparable and de-duplicated measurement is stronger than ever. This is evidenced by the ongoing strength of our National TV Measurement business which was up mid-single digits in the second quarter.","Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up a strong 82% in the quarter. We've expanded our capabilities within Digital Ad Ratings, adding duration-weighted impressions, viewability and fraud detection as planned. The integrity and quality of our measurement have enabled us to win in digital, driving widespread adoption of our Total Audience Measurement offerings.","Marketing Effectiveness was up 6% constant currency and 1% organically, which adjusts for the Visual IQ acquisition and the exit of TV Brand Effect. Our results are significantly below our expectations as revenues were impacted by GDPR and changes to the consumer data privacy landscape. We have several hundred clients and data partners in this space and market changes have been disruptive.","There are a few dynamics that caused us to have a more conservative outlook for 2018. First, the digital advertising ecosystem saw a disruption in the second quarter as large digital platforms made changes to their offerings to increase security for consumer data. Second, we expect operational and policy changes on third-party targeting to contribute to a slowdown in the back half of the year. Third, GDPR and changes in the consumer data privacy landscape is a near-term challenge that has clients and data suppliers working towards compliance as it relates to targeting and data usage rights. Now, this is a short-term disruption, but it may take some time before the market stabilizes. As such, we're moderating our second half outlook in Marketing Effectiveness accordingly.","Despite the headwinds, we see strengths in other areas of our Marketing Effectiveness portfolio. For example, we've seen our strong demand for Advanced Audience segments that are underpinning audience-based buying systems such as OpenAP. Last week we announced of these premium audience segments will also be available on Snapchat's ad-buying platform through the Nielsen Marketing Cloud. Longer term, we remain bullish on the ongoing growth opportunity in this part of our business.","As expected, Audio was flat in the quarter and Other Watch was down 21.3% constant currency, reflecting continued pruning of noncore assets and runoff of legacy digital assets. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $368 million, up 2.8% constant currency. Watch margins were 42.9%, down 50 basis points constant currency as price and volume growth were offset by unfavorable mix.","To sum up on Watch, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, as the investments we've made in Total Audience Measurement continue to serve us well. We have a strong foundation from which to evolve our business along with changes in the marketplace, and Marketing Effectiveness outcome-based metrics are becoming increasingly important to clients and we're well-positioned to capture significant growth in this part of our business long term.","Near term, however, we expect our second half results to be impacted by the changing consumer data privacy landscape, as I mentioned, and we're lowering our 2018 Watch revenue outlook to approximately 2.5% growth on a constant currency basis.","Turning to Buy, the key takeaway is that the pressure in the fast-moving consumer goods industry among global multinationals does not show signs of abating in the near term. We're now seeing this in both Developed and Emerging Markets which impacted our 2Q results and 2018 outlook. We are focused on our key initiatives to drive improved results over time despite the environment.","Second quarter total Buy revenue was $789 million, down 5.4% on a constant currency basis and organically. Our revenue in the Developed Markets was $488 million, down 6.9% constant currency behind increased weakness from global multinationals. Our business in the Emerging Markets was also impacted by weakness in global multinationals. Revenue was $293 million, up 30 basis points constant currency.","While we continue to see growth from local clients in these markets, multinational spend, which represents approximately 60% of our revenue, has weakened significantly. This is especially true in markets in Southeast Asia and Greater China, two important growth regions. The pressure in these markets for multinationals overshadowed solid growth in some markets in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa. We are sharply focused on our efforts to drive incremental value for our clients to improve our top line results. This includes investing in more coverage and granularity and increasing the penetration of the broader Nielsen product portfolio. Our Corporate Buy revenue was down $9 million or 55.6% constant currency, reflecting our pruning of noncore Buy assets.","As a result of the increased pressure in the Buy segment, we are lowering our 2018 revenue outlook to negative 4.5% on a constant currency basis. We are focused on our three strategic initiatives to drive improved results: one, the Connected System; two, driving growth through retailer partnerships; and three, Total Consumer Measurements. I'll make a few comments on each of these.","First, the Connected System platform enables us to integrate our core measurement data with our analytics data, driving faster decision-making for our clients. The feedback from clients continues to be extremely positive. We now have 48 connected partners who have analytics apps running on our platform, 230 clients using at least one component of the system, and we're in the process of deploying the full-scale end-to-end system.","Second, retailer partnerships. We've seen great traction with the Walmart and Sam's Club supplier collaboration programs and have signed up nearly 400 manufacturing clients since launching these programs earlier in the year. We also recently added to our relationship with Walmart when they chose us as their preferred provider of consumer panel data services.","Third, Total Consumer Measurement. E-commerce is a key area of focus both in Developed and Emerging Markets. We're continuing to work towards solutions that will enable clients to have the same level of granularity in the online world as they do offline. More broadly, we are focused on adapting our coverage to include all of the emerging channels that matter most to our clients.","Buy EBITDA was $110 million, down 32.1% constant currency, driven by softer-than-expected revenue, as well as continued investments in our retailer initiatives and the Connected System. We are accelerating our efforts to reduce head count and drive cost out to reflect the current market realities and improve the margin profile of the Buy segment.","A big part of this is our plan to transform our operations function, which includes consolidating platforms and operations teams and automating and digitizing many of our operations processes. Our teams have been executing extremely well, we are ahead of schedule, and we simply need to do more given the challenges in our end markets. We've increased our three-year cost-out target to approximately $650 million, up from the previous $500 million target.","Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes.","In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 90 basis points benefit on revenue and a 10 basis points benefit on EBITDA. If yesterday's spot rates hold constant through 2018, then we expect a 20 basis points benefit on revenue and a 30 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year. Our updated currency forecast represents a $0.06 a share drag on EPS versus previous guidance.","Moving to 2018 guidance, our second quarter results and second half outlook are significantly below our previous forecast, and we're lowering our guidance accordingly. We now expect total company revenue to decline by approximately 1% on a constant currency basis. In this construction, we expect Watch revenue to grow 2.5% and Buy revenue to decline by 4.5%, both on a constant currency basis.","We are lowering our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to decline 2.3 points and our full-year EPS guidance to $0.95 to $1 per share. While we're very focused on lowering our cost structure, these efforts do not fully offset the impact from the lowered revenue outlook in the short term.","We're lowering our free cash flow guidance to approximately $550 million to $575 million primarily to reflect lower EBITDA and higher cash restructuring. It is important to note that we remain committed to our long-term capital structure and capital allocation approach. We expect our free cash flow to improve significantly in 2019 as we get past the onetime investment in the retailer initiatives and have lower spend on the Connected System. This will enable us to de-lever and maintain the dividend at current levels. Given the lower 2018 cash outlook, we plan to moderate the pace of share buybacks over the next 12 months. We've given you a few additional model details on the right-hand side of the page.","On the next two pages, we've updated the revenue framework that we typically give at the beginning of the year. As you will note, in Watch, we are tightening the range for Audience Measurement of Video and Text to 5.5% to 6%. We expect Marketing Effectiveness to be flat to up low-single digits, which assumes the market challenges I talked about earlier will persist through the back half. This construction gets us to total Watch constant currency revenue growth of approximately 2.5% for 2018 compared to our previous estimate of 5% to 6% growth.","In Buy, we expect Developed Buy revenue to be down mid-single digits and Emerging Markets to be roughly flat. We are pleased with the progress from our initiatives, but we assume the most recent pressure in multinational client spend continues. This construction gets us to a total Buy constant currency revenue decline of approximately 4.5% for 2018 compared to our previous estimate of minus 1% to plus 1%.","Regarding our 2020 plan, we remain focused on all of the same initiatives to drive growth and margin expansion over time for both Watch and Buy. Given our 2018 forecast, the growth and margin trajectory will obviously change, but we're committed to the same goals to return to mid-single digit top-line growth and annual margin expansion over time.","So to wrap up, look, this is a difficult and disappointing result, but we remain committing to turning around our performance. We've worked appropriately to de-risk the back-half forecast and we're focused on delivering our revised guidance.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Jamere. Carol, we're ready to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for additional questions. Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I just wanted to get a better sense of Buy Developed Markets. It seems like you're pointing to the end market to have kind of increased pressure this quarter. Obviously, the pressure from fast-moving consumer packaged goods and U.S. food in particular has been around for a while. When we look at the Nielsen data in particular about their volumes, it doesn't seem like it got much worse in the second quarter. So could you just give a little more explanation of why you show more intensity from your CPG clients second quarter?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, thanks, Andrew. I think broadly speaking, there's more volatility and uncertainty in Buy just due to the environment in the FMCG end markets. We saw increased pressure on client spend in the Developed Markets in Q2 and as multinationals spending weakened further, and our guidance assumes a similar environment to what we saw in the second quarter.","Now, the initiatives that we've spoken about, the retailer initiatives, the Connected System are on track and they'll help in the second half. But given the pressures that we see across the business and some of our data and some of our analytics projects, we felt it appropriate to de-risk the back half of the forecast for the revenue declines.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about Emerging. In past quarters, it seemed like you were convinced that there really wasn't too much of an issue there, there were some sort of isolated things in China and with natural disasters in the fourth quarter and then things were getting a little bit back to normal. And so, basically, I guess what really happened? Is it the market trends? Is it specific large clients that are multinationals that were pulling back? It sounds like \u2013 you're sounding like now that it is pretty broad-based, but like I guess why wasn't this sort of a little bit more known before? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, thanks, Toni. As I mentioned before, broadly speaking, there's simply more volatility and uncertainty in the environment. The environment has gotten worse than what we expected. We saw a fairly significant pullback in multinational clients spend really across the Emerging Markets as we went through the quarter. And as I said before, we're not expecting this pressure to abate.","The softness is primarily in China and Southeast Asia. And as I said before, this actually overshadowed some strong performances elsewhere, markets in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa. What we're seeing, broadly speaking, is that local giants are continuing to show growth. However, the multinationals are under pressure. And this pressure is working its way through the Emerging Markets and, as such, we've lowered our guidance appropriately.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Just given the Buy strategic review and I guess the magnitude of the free cash flow guidance cut, can you give us any sense of what is the free cash flow breakdown between the two segments? And then just I saw the dividend declaration today, but what are the board's thoughts on the dividend payout? Why is this the right one now that you're expecting to exit the year at 4.3 times net leverage? Thank you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yes, first on free cash flow, I'll remind you that the third quarter and the fourth quarter drive the majority of our free cash flow due to seasonality. I'll remind you again that one quarter was \u2013 the first quarter was particularly light due to the retailer investments, and the lower forecast that we had this year is really based on the revenue reduction that I talked about.","I think you if you look at free cash flow more broadly, as I mentioned, this is an investment year for us. We have onetime investments in the retailer initiatives and the Connected System that are naturally going to roll off next year. So our free cash for 2019 will be up significantly. As we've spoken before, we maintain our commitment to our capital structure and our long-term free cash flow allocation approach. Given the lower investment profile next year, we expect to be able to de-lever and still protect the dividend. So we've reviewed this in detail with the board, and we remain committed going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. My question is broadly just on the issue of visibility I guess you have as a company or maybe the financial forecasting here. I mean, you've had several opportunities here to reset, but even just from last quarter, I think last quarter and even intra-quarter conferences, you had said GDPR was a net positive and you cut the Watch guidance in half. You said free cash flow you were confident on the $800 million and you lowered that $250 million. And then you just addressed the Emerging Markets cut as well. So I guess I'm just curious like what changes in two months that causes such a big disruption and maybe you can address those specific items as well?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Sure. Thanks, Manav. As I said before, there simply is more volatility and uncertainty in Buy due to the environment. This is particularly true with multinationals, and it's now starting to impact both the Developed and the Emerging Markets. If I look at the changes that we made in Watch, the fallout of GDPR and the changing data privacy landscape impacted our Marketing Effectiveness more than we anticipated. This is a short-term impact.","And then if I speak more broadly as it relates to the actions that we've taken around guidance cuts, make no mistake about it, we're disappointed in our performance across the board. We don't make excuses. Our focus is on execution in the difficult environment that has more volatility and uncertainty. We'll continue to be transparent about what we see when we see it and the impact on our financial performance.","The challenges that we're experiencing in the business are largely market-driven. We have been facing some headwinds here, but we continue to work to improve our processes across the company. And where there are issues, we are swift to address them. The other thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to make sure that we appropriately de-risked the back half of the year.","Let me move into your point on GDPR, and I just want to be really clear. We were ready. What we're seeing in the marketplace is that it's taking clients longer to absorb the changes. What we said last quarter is that we didn't expect Measurement to be impacted, and it wasn't. So our Digital Ad Ratings product, we had all the data that we needed, and campaigns were up 82%.","What did happen, though, is we underestimated the impact on targeting and our data suppliers working towards compliance. It's a pretty complex environment. We have several hundred clients and over 200 data partners in this space. And GDPR and changes in the landscape is a near-term challenge that we're working through.","And then your last point around free cash flow, clearly with a reduced revenue guidance for this year, we took the EBITDA guidance down. We had higher restructuring associated with our cost-out initiatives, and so it just follows that we had to reduce the guidance. So the changes in the business rippled through the income statement and that flowed all the way through to the free cash flow portion of it. So that's what we're focused on is execution, de-risk in the back half of the year. We're disappointed in the performance, but we're focused on delivering on the guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Oh, hi. Could I follow up again on the GDPR point, please? I guess it's probably not the biggest driver of the miss here, but I still don't quite understand why this became a problem in the quarter. I mean, you're not really involved in actually buying ads yourself if it's in the Marketing Effectiveness business. That's, I thought, more of a subscription type of a service to the data feeds. I mean, could you just explain a little bit more, please, why it became a bigger issue in the quarter? I'm still not quite clear. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yes. So as I talked about, the entire ecosystem saw some disruption as some of the big platforms made some changes to their offerings. The second thing that happened was, if you look at third-party targeting, there are lots of operational and policy changes that are impacting targeting, and it's taking longer for those things to sort of ripple their way through our data \u2013 our clients and our data partners. So we expect this to take some time to stabilize, and we've moderated our second half outlook accordingly.","I think the other thing I want to make sure that you understand is that in terms of the overall impact on media spend, it's not surprising that a number of companies haven't seen an impact, but there's a clear delineation between advertising and the analytics that come with it. So things in our portfolio like multitouch attribution, like some of the work that we're doing in Nielsen Catalina Solutions, some of the work that we're doing in the Nielsen Marketing Cloud are definitely impacted by the changes that our clients see and our data partners see and, as a result, it's an impact on our business.","So from a Measurement standpoint, media spend is continuing, we're continuing to measure that and it's not being impacted in the near term, but the analytics around some of that activity is being impacted in the near term and that's what we've tried to reflect in our forecast.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","What I'll add to that, Tim, this is Mitch. One way to think about all the services we have in our Marketing Effectiveness area that relate to targeting, you can divide them into two categories.","One is services that help advertisers target segments of consumers, and the other is services that help advertisers target individual consumers or personalized marketing. And it's that second category, personalized, that has had a bigger effect in the short term from the GDPR and the changes in the consumer data privacy landscape.","And it's pretty reasonable when we think it through that while the dust is still settling, a lot of our clients are saying, I'm not sure it makes sense to spend money on these kinds of analytics right now because I use these to guide some future behaviors and maybe I'll let things stabilize before I spend the money. So they're not backing off on the advertising activity itself, but what they are backing off on is some of the analytics that inform that advertising activity. And it's pretty logical when we think about it that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the Buy segment, I was curious if you could talk about the like-for-like client trends. To what degree is competition impacting you, for example, providing clients with some leverage to drive prices down versus is it more purely that the like-for-like client is just on their own independently saying we have less budget?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, I think there are a couple of dynamics there. Number one, it's very clearly a very competitive environment in some markets, particularly the U.S. market. That environment hasn't changed dramatically. I would say as it relates to our clients who are experiencing difficulty finding growth, there are just pressures in overall spend in the marketplace, and having a competitive environment exacerbates that to a certain extent.","But the pressures that we've been seeing, as it relates our big multinational clients, is largely driven by the pressures that they're facing in the end markets, both with the changes in consumer tastes, the changes that are happening at retail. These are things that are impacting our clients. And so what we've been focused on is how do we help those clients pivot to growth. And the initiatives that we're working on with the Connected System, which will give them an opportunity to have better data in a challenging environment, the initiatives that we have around retailer initiatives, the initiatives that we have around Total Consumer Measurement, these are all things that are going to help our clients.","I would say the other thing from a competitive standpoint is that while the environment is pretty challenging in certain markets, particularly in the U.S., we are the only global competitor, so that long-term competitive advantage we have as being the market leader globally serves us well as we look at renewing our existing client base and growing our business in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. Thank you. Man, I'm sorry to keep going back to this GDRP thing, it seems to be the topic of the day. Can I ask this question, please? I'm just trying to understand how it specifically impacts your major data sets? So, for instance, your panels, all of your panels, are obviously, I would hope, unaffected. I would think that the co-op contributing to the Buy retail point-of-sale data set ought to be safe, if I can call it that. But I'd love to hear, it seems that maybe your partnership with Facebook specifically on your non-officially collected Internet data set, I would just love to just hear some reassurance from you exactly what's going on then in your continued access to that data set. And then I guess also, Catalina, your partner and the shopping cart data set, are you \u2013 just let me hear your confidence that those two data sets you can still employ as far as you know going forward. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, thanks, Todd. So you're exactly right. All the data that we need from a measurement standpoint is intact. So we continue to get the data sets that we need to do Digital Ad Ratings, and we're doing that in a compliant fashion and we were ready. As it relates to our core data sets around panel, those are inherently compliant just based on the nature and the way that we build our panels and the company.","The place where we see challenges, and it's largely tied to the challenges that our clients and our data partners are having to basically get themselves in a position to be compliant, are things like multitouch attribution, things like the Nielsen Marketing Cloud where we provide targeting and segmenting data, and it's largely based on our aggregation of data from a number of data partners to do so. Those are the places where we see some challenges. And so as those challenges sort of ripple their way through the marketplace, obviously, it's disruptive to clients that are signing up new contracts with us, our ability to go close revenue.","Again, this is a near-term challenge. We expect the market to stabilize. We're being conservative in terms of saying that we're going to moderate our second half outlook accordingly and not assuming there will be an immediate snapback because it could take some time for some of these changes to work their way through the marketplace and stabilize.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","But you're right, Todd. Our proprietary data sets, including the data that comes from our panels which are opt-in from the start, no issue there. It's really the third-party data sets, and there's a lot of them because that's the way measurement and, more importantly in this case, analytics works these days. It's a team sport, as our colleague Megan Clarken often says. And a lot of these products these days, what it's all about is integrating a variety of data sets to create something that is better and can do more than any one data set can do. And, well, that's in the long run a great thing, but in the short run with some of these changes in the privacy landscape is posing some of these challenges for our partners.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, guys. My question's on Marketing Effectiveness specifically, and I guess there's kind of two parts to it, maybe one for Mitch and one for Jamere. Just, Mitch, I know you don't want to speak any further about the strategic review process, but obviously Marketing Effectiveness taps into elements of Buy to create its product suite. So I just would love to hear some high-level thoughts on how you expect that to carry forward if there is a transaction consummated, whether that's some type of commercial agreements with the buyer, that type of thing.","And then just second, Jamere, maybe rather than try to approach the question around shortfall due to GDPR for the mechanisms that go on with the different data sets, could you just tell us a little bit more about kind of what came up short in your model? I would think it's volumes, but is it volumes? Is it price? A little color there would help. Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Marketing Effectiveness, Dan, remains a really big and important part of our future. We're incredibly well-positioned. The answer to these age-old questions about what do I get for my advertising is hard to answer if you go back as recently as five years ago, and today we're able to answer this question better than we ever have before at scale, almost in real time and with the level of actionability that's just completely unprecedented at any other time in my career.","And it's only going to keep getting better. It's only going to keep getting better, the capabilities in this area, and we're just amazingly well-positioned. And so we're long term bullish on this area even though, as we mentioned, we see some near-term pressures, and really nothing related to strategic review of Buy changes that view of the future with respect to Marketing Effectiveness.","So, Jamere, over to you.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And in terms of your question, where we are we seeing the pressure? It's clearly volume. It's around being able to get contracts closed and being able to execute on those just given the changes that are impacting our clients and our data partners.","So, as Mitch said, there's incredible long-term demand there. I think the things that we're offering in Marketing Effectiveness have never been more important as you think about the ecosystem and sort of a modern media company, if you will. And we built a portfolio accordingly. So we're seeing some near-term volume pressures, and we're assuming that those volume pressures don't snap back immediately. And there's a pretty significant backlog of work that we'll be doing for clients once we work our way through these changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to dive a little bit deeper into the Buy segment dynamics. Can you elaborate on, in the Developed CPG end markets, specifically where the new headwinds are rising, I guess emphasis on new versus what you didn't know about a quarter ago? And then also talk about the competitive dynamics specifically IRI, how they're pricing relative to Nielsen and whether you're seeing pressure there. And then lastly around execution issues that you've been seeing in the Emerging Markets, how that's playing into your revised Emerging Market growth outlook in Buy as well.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. I would say very broadly speaking, there's more volatility and uncertainty in Buy just due to the environment in the FMCG end markets. We've seen the challenges associated with a number of our clients as it relates to the ability to find volume and price growth in the marketplace. We've seen the impact of challenger brands. And very candidly, the most challenging end markets are places where the strength of the Nielsen client base, being the multinational clients, actually place. And so we're seeing that pressure roll through our forecast, and we're forecasting accordingly.","As I mentioned in terms of the competitive dynamics, there's really no change in those competitive dynamics. We've always been in a very competitive market, particularly in the U.S., less so in the emerging markets. There's really no changes in the dynamics there. However, when you're in an environment where clients are under pressure, the impact of a competitive environment on the margins can be a little bit more significant on the business.","I would say the other thing to think about as it relates to our forecast is we're de-risking the back half of the year. The initiatives that we're working on position us well competitively for the long term and we're focused on executing on those.","And then the last point that you made about execution in the Emerging Markets, before, we've talked about China, we've talked about our business in China being pressured this quarter. You have the dynamic of the additional pressure from FMCGs. Quite frankly, we still have more work to do operationally there. And as I said before, we have to get China right in order for our Emerging Markets to grow. And we're focused on those challenges. We've made some changes in those marketplaces that are going to help us longer term, but we still have a little bit more work to do there operationally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Surinder Singh from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Surinder Singh Thind - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just following up on an earlier question about guidance. How much confidence should we have in your guidance at this point given the repeated misses, or maybe given if there's as much volatility and uncertainty as you say, why you can give guidance?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yes, so what we've done in the forecast is we've spent time with our teams completing deep-dive reviews of the business, and we've reduced our outlook in the back half to reflect the moderating spend in both Buy and parts of our Watch portfolio. We've assumed a tough environment in the Developed and the Emerging Markets in the back half due to a more challenging environment. There's a recognition that there's more volatility and uncertainty. We know that the Watch volatility is short term in nature, but the Buy volatility we're not assuming that there's going to be a snapback. So with this lower guidance, we believe we've appropriately de-risked the back half of the year, and our teams are executing and focused on delivering.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Respecting you don't want to talk about the strategic review, maybe I can ask a question this way. Did the board contemplate a strategic review of the whole firm, given the overlap between Buy and Watch?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yes, here's what I'll say the board is working with. We have two great franchises. We have blue-chip clients with mission-critical data, we have a global footprint. We have lots of optionality. And so what we're going to do is we're going to do a deep dive to establish the blueprint going forward, and we're looking forward to working with the board on this in the future.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","But the focus really will be on the Buy segment with the strategic review, just to be clear.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Watts from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Aaron L. Watts - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Guys, thanks for having me on. As I sit with my credit hat, a positive attribute of the company has always been your conservative approach to leverage, if not marching towards investment grade and certainly staying within shouting distance. So just a couple quick questions on that. I guess as you think about the various directions your strategic review could go, would it be fair to say that you would aim to come out the other end with leverage maintained or perhaps improved?","And then I guess second, with leverage creeping higher over the past year, and you've got it to 4.3 times at the end of this year, can you remind us where you'd like to see that leverage at over the next few years? I suppose I'm asking you what your latest target leverage is in light of recent performance. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So we have reviewed leverage in detail with the board. There's no change to our long-term leverage target, which we've defined as being in the 3 times area. Obviously, it's elevated in the near term due to the investments that we're making in CapEx. We have higher restructuring. We have some investments that we've made in retailer initiatives, and then we took the revenue forecast down this year.","As I mentioned a little bit earlier, the free cash flow number pops up next year just based on the fact that we've had some onetime initiatives this year. We're comfortable running the business in the 3 times area long term, and we'll naturally de-lever in 2019 just based on some of the things that we've talked about in terms of investments that are rolling off.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Oh, thanks for taking the extra question here. Question about your thoughts on now that you've seen the impact of GDPR in Europe, curious about your thoughts on the California law and just kind of your expectations longer run. And to the extent that marketers are more conscious of the notion of ethical data very broad sense, notwithstanding the vast majority of your data is obviously going to be past any test the market will have. To what degree are you thinking about how this plays out in the United States over the next few years?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. I think a couple of things stand out to me. This is an evolving area, but our approach at least inside the company is twofold. Number one, privacy is sort of designed into our approach. So as we think about all the things that we're doing in terms of measurement, we design privacy into our products. We review that not only with our product teams but also our privacy teams corporately to make sure that those processes are in place.","I think the second thing that we recognize is that this landscape is changing. And as we think about areas like Marketing Effectiveness, we think about the relationships that we have with our data partners, we think about the relationships with our clients, we will be in tune with that landscape and we will build our products accordingly.","But what I want to make sure that everybody understands is that, long term, there's going to be incredible demand for these products and services. And the challenge for providers like Nielsen is to build a set of products that are privacy compliant, that meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities around the world and be able to serve these markets.","So there's a tremendous growth opportunity there. You're not going see a slowdown in advertising, and we don't believe that you'll see a slowdown in the need for analytics to help marketers and advertisers understand the return on investment in that spin.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Agreed. Short term, we're going to continue to see disruption from time to time, but long term, because of our conservative approach to this area, Brian, we continue to firmly believe we're very well-positioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi and thanks for the additional as well. I know this is not going to be \u2013 I'm not going to get a straight answer for it, but I wanted to ask a little about next year. You had kind of implied at your Investor Day that after the investments in Connected System for this year come off, as in the step up in cost rolls through, there should be a nice kind of hockey stick growth curve into next year. You did kind of make a reference to that during the conversation here that that was still the case, so just wonder if you could give us any indication, all else being equal, or taking into account what's gone on in this quarter, how we can start to think about next year.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So, as you know, we typically come back in the fall with our 2019 guidance, and so I won't be very specific in terms of how to think about it. But let me give you a couple of broad thoughts.","First of all, the change in the revenue trajectory based on 2018 obviously changes the way that we think about the cadence for growth in the next year. The second thing I'll say is that from a cost-out standpoint, with the increased pressure that we've seen in the marketplace, we've accelerated the cost-out efforts, likely not enough to offset some of the revenue challenges that we've talked about. Unfortunately, that revenue drag more than offset some of the additional cost-out actions that we've taken. Near term, you have a little bit of a leverage drag.","But all the initiatives that we've talked about is part of that profile. So the things that we're doing in Total Audience Measurement, the work that we're doing in Marketing Effectiveness, the Connected System, the work in Total Consumer Measurement, all of those initiatives are intact and we feel very good about them and we're making tremendous progress there.","So the key drivers will be what happens with the environment and what happens with some of the short-term things that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness that while we're not assuming there's a snapback in the back half of this year, we believe that there's tremendous growth opportunities there in general, and we expect some of that to rebound in next year.","If you look at our major initiative of Total Audience Measurement, we've made tremendous progress there. We have a lot of movement in Total Audience Measurement. And so the framework that we gave as it relates to Audience Measurement of Video and Text will be intact as we go through these changes.","So, still early innings, we'll come back to you after we work our way through our operating plans in the summer and have our reviews with the board, and we'll come back in the fall and give you our update on our 2019 outlook.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","And just one thing I have to add to that, there hasn't been much discussion yet on this call about our efforts in the operations part of our business to drive automation and consolidation, which is a really big part of our efficiency play over the next few years. And I just want to emphasize that all of those efforts are on track and progressing extraordinarily well, and they're a really important part of our future. They'll contribute from a cost perspective in particular to 2019.","And just as importantly, those initiatives are not only proving themselves on the cost side of the equation, but they're also driving speed and quality. And that really translates to revenue upside for our business in the areas where those initiatives are especially important. So we'll have a lot more to say about that future, but I just wanted to give that brief update in terms of what to expect from us in 2019. Our operations, automation and consolidation efforts just continue to progress extraordinarily well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Again, thank you very for taking my extra question. Just thought somebody should at least broach this topic. Very hard to fill Mitch's shoes, obviously, but any comments you can make on the type of candidates, the profile that you think the board is looking for for the next CEO? Can you tell us whether they're considering both internal and external candidates or just one or the other would be preferred?","And then finally, it seems a little tricky just with the timing and the strategic view of Buy. One might think that the type of CEO you might look for might be different depending on whether whatever happens to Buy. And so, I don't know if that's true or not, but any comments on that and just the general topic that you can make, I'm sure we'd all appreciate. Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Well, obviously, Todd, I can't speak fully for our board. One thing I can say is we will have very big shoes to fill with Mitch's departure. But what I'll say is that the board is doing a search. We have a lot of confidence in our board being able to execute on that. And in the meantime, those of us that are on the operating team, Mitch included, are focused on execution. We have a very strong and deep bench with a lot of confidence in the team, and that's what we'll be focused on and we'll allow the board to conduct a search and we'll be able to have a vertical start-up when that search is over.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Sara Gubins for closing remarks.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Carol, and thank you all for joining us on today's call.

Please note all lines are in listen-only mode at this time. (Operator Instructions) After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) ","I will now turn the call over to the host, Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Zale, please proceed.","Liz Zale","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Nielsen\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2011 call. On the call with me today is David Calhoun, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019ll call your attention to the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contain within our webcast presentation. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements including those about Nielsen\u2019s outlook and prospects that relates to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our outlook is provided for the purpose of providing information about current expectations for 2012. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes.","With that, I will turn the call over to David Calhoun. Dave?","David Calhoun","Thank you, Liz. Hope everyone enjoyed the Super Bowl last evening. I\u2019m going to start with just a sketch of 2011 performance, our first year since we went out with the IPO at the beginning of 2011. Revenue for the year grew 8%, 6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 10%, 8% on a constant currency basis. Net debt leverage declined to 4.0, again very strong performance given the fact that for at least Brian and I, we started at over 9.","We strengthened the balance sheet throughout the year and in addition Brian will share some treasury activities that bring additional strength here coming into 2012. Business conditions in Q4 relative to prior quarters were positive overall. Only trouble spots for us were really natural disaster related and or political, that was the Middle East and Taiwan and in the developing world side. [Taiwan] for us pretty much stopped in its tracks as a result of the flood, but net-net we were up 15% on the year in the developing markets.","On the developed markets clearly things are more cautious. Europe for certain is in the doldrums, it has been, it continues to be and we expect it will continue to be. So, I don\u2019t expect much in terms of variance from any prior or forward periods as a result of that. U.S., most of the clash and a little self-induced as a result of Wal-Mart coming on board with us into the second quarter, such that some analytics that would benefit from deeper Wal-Mart data will be postponed until that moment, but net-net a positive market environment for us.","Our investments continued to be again robust and we continue to execute well. So expanding retail measurement coverage in two specific programs, first Wal-Mart, we\u2019ve been absence for quite a while, but volumes of data are massive, the amount of coding that has to go on is massive. But it\u2019s going on beautifully and we remain on-track for that program again for delivery in the second quarter. And then secondly, global reach and read, we just continue to expand our footprint in the rural parts to China, rural parts of India and across Africa.","Measurement across new platforms and devices and specifically online campaign ratings, I\u2019ve lots of confidence that this change really change in industry approach to the measurement of online campaigns is in full swing and I feel good about that and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about that on the next page. Again, it will be a little while before the financial models play out, but at least in terms of industry advocacy I feel great.","Extending market effectiveness capabilities watching by, this is what started as a niche analytic capabilities that marry or watch in by data for the benefit of advertising campaigns and so forth, that can aid current measures in the hundreds of millions of dollars and we as part of our acquisition strategy with marketing analytics last year this continues to feel very good, very robust for us, it\u2019s a strong double-digit gainer in the analytics space. And then finally, we will take you through our guidance in 2012 very much in line with the long-term framework if not towards the high-end of it.","Next I like to talk about the progress on these two major initiatives big investments on our part. U.S. retail expansion it really is the new Wal-Mart data, it will give us a much more comprehensive view of the U.S. market for both retailers and manufacturers and I would stress that retailers are very important segment for us. We are substantially complete with the commercial terms and agreements set, again, to be implemented in the second quarter and feel very good about that progress or plans we\u2019re looking forward to getting the data.","We have completed the final stages of what we would refer to as a massive data refresh, anyway no hiccups to-date and again feel good about it. And we\u2019ve got some real early signs, good signs about insight opportunities, which probably should not be unexpected by anybody, that\u2019s why did in the first place certainly for our plans and for us and working with our retailers and specifically for Wall-Mart. And we remain on-track for that second quarter start up.","On the online campaign rating front, again, I\u2019ll remind everyone this is a tough implementation, lest because of the technical requirements and product requirements, because we really have been through that. We are in the process of delivering everyday to a wide variety of participants. The challenges on this one is getting the industry lined up to accept and learn how to use and building these used cases has been our endeavor here. Anyway we feel great about it. We\u2019ve got 35 advertisers, these are not small, they\u2019re substantial big advertisers. We\u2019ve got almost 400 campaigns now under our belt. We\u2019ve got 151 running as we speak, 48 publishers are in, agencies have begun to talk to us about how they can use it with their players, very important cog in the wheel. And then finally, just the network and platform delivery of this metric is also making real progress.","So, again all of these elements in effect will turn the online campaign measurement approach to one that resembles television and then therefore can be compared across platforms. All of those things are beginning to fall in place and feel very good about that. Most importantly these used cases around campaign are generating real efficiencies for our clients. They either get more targeted audience or they get what they had for less money and that\u2019s ultimately what it\u2019s all about. So again, I feel very good about that progress.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Brian who is going to run you through the financials and first look at the Q&A. Brian?","Brian West","Thanks, Dave, and I\u2019ll move on to page eight for the total Nielsen results. 2011 was another year proven out the consistency of this business model and our ability to deliver on our commitments. And it starts with the revenue lines, so revenue for the full-year came in at $5.532 billion, that\u2019s up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and in line with our guidance of 5 to 7 which we set out about a year ago.","Our adjusted EBITDA came in at a $1.546 billion, that\u2019s up 8% and the adjusted EBITDA margin rate, it was just to touch on to 28% and that\u2019s 57 bps of expansion, better than expected while still in full invested mode, that\u2019s important because we continue to invest in all the programs Dave outlined and again, a little better than our range of 30 to 50 bps. Our adjusted net income came in at $590 million, that\u2019s up 31%, slightly above what our guidance was primarily due to interest and cash taxes and our diluted earnings per share was $1.61.","Finally on the net debt, as Dave mentioned, we are very pleased with the performance of our deleveraging and export 4.0 times and just technically it\u2019s actually 3.98 times, we\u2019re pretty proud of that three point handle. Again, making full investments throughout the year and we deliver on our commitments. ","And with that I\u2019ll go a little bit deeper in to the fourth quarter. Page nine, fourth quarter revenue came in at 1.421 billion that\u2019s a 5%, adjusted EBITDA at 432, that\u2019s up 9% and adjusted margins over 30%, very healthy margin expansion, primarily driven from a combination of productivity and cost leadership actions, as well as a higher mix of the rich data products.","Adjusted net income came in at $190 million. The diluted earnings per share was $0.51 and the free cash flow was $148 million. I\u2019ll talk more about that free cash flow picture and some of the drivers. Again, steady good margin expansion, the free cash flow was what we like to see and the earning power from that reduced leverage is evident.","If I move on to page 10, the segment revenue. I will start with total buy revenue, just came at $896 million, that\u2019s up 5% year-over-year. And it was driven by a 6% growth in our information business and 4% increase in our insight business. Developing markets was up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Revenues for developing market in the quarter was $291 million and for the full-year, it\u2019s a 1.125 billion, again up 15% year-over-year and a very big healthy franchise. Our developed markets had steady growth of 3%, as Dave mentioned Europe is still pressured, but pretty much as we expected.","Moving on to Watch. Revenues came in at $504 million, that\u2019s up 3%. Our television business was up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Very steady, very consistent and as expected. You know soft spot on our Watch side is a small product, it\u2019s more discretionary in nature, which is Europe and it\u2019s print related. So, it\u2019s getting to the point where it doesn\u2019t really matter much anymore and we planned for it. So, it\u2019s a little bit of pressure for that particular segment. If you look at acquisitions, revenue came in at $21 million. That\u2019s a 17% year-over-year that\u2019s trade show timing in there. The underlying growth rate is closer to 10%.","A one final point, I\u2019d make is that these numbers include $54 million recap of revenue from Buy to Watch, it\u2019s a segment shift. And really we grew, for instance our Mobile business, we grew it up in leveraging our global footprint at 100 countries. When our Global Mobile Management Analytics, it\u2019s so big and its growing fast, we\u2019re recalling it out. We\u2019re putting in Watch Group launch, and we\u2019re resourcing it like crazy with leadership etcetera. So, better lines with how we run the business, something similar for ad solutions business.","Page 11, segment profitability, overall good margin expansion. Buy for the quarter came in at $222 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 2%. I\u2019ll remind you that most of our investments come in our Buy side on the OpEx line and you see that particularly on our developing market expansion global reach in lead program.","On Watch, EBITDA came in at $210 million, that\u2019s up 9%, very nice leverage, Expositions at 4, and then total of 432, up 9%. Again, good investments in the Buy side and we\u2019re executing our global productivity programs.","Moving on to page 12, some cash flow and balance sheet items. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $148 million. CapEx for the quarter was $154 million. High in the quarter as expected and for the full-year it\u2019s in the range, if you take out the impact of foreign exchange. Cash tax is $40 million, slightly lower than expected employer basis. The rate was 18% versus 19% largely driven by timing. Our restructuring of $20 million as expected.","Moving on to the balance sheet, net debt came in at $6.156 billion again the net debt ratio was touch under four times. We paid down $382 million of debt in the year and $229 million in the quarter and to get through the cap table on the right hand side by instrument where the debt pay downs came from.","Moving on to page 13, I\u2019ll remind everyone that our financial policy isn\u2019t has been to reduce risk and reduce leverage and increase our financial flexibility and we were very pleased with the way we de-risked it to over time and particularly this year. As I mentioned, we paid down $382 million of debt post IPO and just last month we took another meaningful step towards de-risking. We refinanced $1.2 billion of our existing 2013 term loan maturities with a new five year facility all of that is 100% pre-payable.","The transaction closed in early February, the initial rate is LIBOR plus 225 and that will step down as leverage reduces and is note LIBOR four. We\u2019re very pleased with the transaction, we think it continues to move the stack out at a rate that\u2019s very attractive. And I point out the debt maturity profile, before this transaction by 2013 had a big stack of 1.5 billion all that has being pushed out as again I mentioned very important transaction for us. And for the next four years there is no meaningful maturity in front of us give us more flexibility. And as Dave mentioned, our deleveraging over the course of time back in \u201806 it was over nine times feels also good to have actual 3.98 as we close the year. And that one last point is we did achieve rating upgrade S&P took us to BB in the last month or so.","With that I will go to page 14, and Dave will start off with a few of the guidance points.","David Calhoun","So this looks familiar, I think to everybody because again we cannot break within the long-term framework and we feel good about sort of the outlook and this doesn\u2019t suggest that there is any big robust market out there. It\u2019s just continuing development in the developing world and it is continuing to battle through the developed world in what we consider to be, probably positive environment in the U.S. and again very tough environment in Europe.","What we see revenue growth between 5 and 7%, again EBITDA margin growth between 30 and 50% basis points remind everybody that the way we control this is typically through programs that we can time, we like to go fast but if we have to differ on occasion we do usually with very little competitive circumstance or difficultly. And then adjusted net income per share between a $1.70 and $1.76 and we will continue to deleverage, we would like to take this out another half a turn we believe we can and the range is on some of these more discrete numbers, I\u2019ll let Brian walk you through.","Brian West","Sure and one point on the revenue and EBITDA, I think it\u2019s important to remind everyone that there will be a reporting phenomena for 2012 given FX volatility. If FX rates stay throughout 2012 exactly where they were on January 1st, there is about 300 basis points impact on revenue lower and about 275 basis points on EBITDA lower. So, just keep that in mind and do your models again its reporting phenomena nothing to do with economics which is why we always talk about constant currency.","In the box a few other items CapEx at 340 to 360 will be no surprise maintain full investment mode consistent with what returned in 2011. D&A 5.30 to 5.40 reflective of the back-end waiting of CapEx particularly that fourth quarter that\u2019ll start run-off the books as we go into 2012.","Net book interest at 4.30 to 4.40, cash taxes 1.50 to 1.60 that approximate 20% rate and a cash restructured at 75 to a 100 that one is probably 0.25 to 0.50 more than we contemplated. And quite frankly, we see more opportunities to leverage our technology investments and our lower cost base. We know this will move on forever but we see more opportunities and we\u2019re going to do it just like we did when we were private and we think it\u2019s healthy for the business long-term. And the weighted diluted share that\u2019s gaining for full-year is going to be 377 million.","With that, I will turn it back over to Liz.","Liz Zale","Sure. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Suzy Stein of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Suzy Stein - Morgan Stanley","","Hi. You mentioned that some of the analytics business was postponed as you incorporate the Wal-Mart data. Can you quantify this in any way in terms of how much it is impacted fourth quarter and I guess how much it should impact first half of \u201812?","David Calhoun ","It\u2019s very hard Suzy to do that, all I\u2019ll tell you is that as I sort of went around the offices and we talked to clients, it became very clear that a bunch of apples is going to go on. I don\u2019t think it was so much negotiating tactics as really just a genuine interest in having the bigger, more fulfilled data. But look, we probably on the insight side in the U.S. on a normal level running rate, we would had a couple of more points of growth and that\u2019s just, again, I attribute it to this, I didn\u2019t go account-by-account and add it up, but that\u2019s clearly what it feels like.","Suzy Stein - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then can you talk about how you\u2019re pricing the OCR product?","David Calhoun","Not yet, but I\u2019ll be happy to do that when we get on this call again. The use cases are planned out as I had hoped and I believe that the model will be robust. But I\u2019m not going to lap a model yet until we get some real substantial sign-ups on that front and I believe that they\u2019ll happen soon and I believe we\u2019ll be able to talk this through more thoroughly in the next call.","Suzy Stein - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Liz Zale","Operator, I think we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Absolutely. Our next question comes from Brian Karimzad of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs","I think you alluded to it here, but just to give us a sense. Within the guidance you\u2019ve given, any sense for how much contribution you\u2019re contemplating from OCR and from the Wal-Mart renegotiations, or is there some you\u2019re still kind of waiting and seeing here to see how it plays out?","David Calhoun","Very little at OCR, very little, because we\u2019re going to allow this industry to breathe as it tries to adopt the new measurement. So on the Wal-Mart side, it\u2019s pretty definitive and it\u2019s a good number for 2012.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And with regard to the ownership structure of the company, we haven\u2019t seen much change on that since the offering. And I know you\u2019re limited in what you can say and what control you might have, but maybe you could help us walk through the way you guys are thinking about that?","David Calhoun","Well, it\u2019ll reflect what I believe is the attitude of our board and more importantly the way Brian and I operate the company. I still look and it still looks and feels like a long-term hold on the part of our owners, because everything we do in terms of operating investments and all the things that we want to do to continue to run this business are fully supported and we move that way. On the other hand, there is no question they recognize the difficulties with a little float. So you can try to figure out on your own just like I do, but I think we\u2019ve got very savvy investors, operating attitudes are fantastic and I do think some along the way they\u2019ll do something to support better float.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Brian. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Lewis of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Dave Lewis - JPMorgan Securities","David Lewis from Michael Meltz\u2019s team. Just one quick question, can you update us on the Facebook partnership, please?","David Calhoun","Well, again, that is OCR. And so it continues to go very well in the sense that the product has been very well received in the marketplace. The technical dimension of the partnership, which is really what it is, has gone sort of flawlessly, and they still represent a big opportunity for Nielsen, more importantly, the measurement represents a big opportunity for Facebook, as it can begin to sell its audience in an accountable way, similar to the way the media interests do in television. So I think that all parties see this as real opportunity and upside if the industry adopts some changes, which, again, as I think I\u2019ve expressed, I\u2019m getting increasingly confident it will.","Dave Lewis - JPMorgan Securities","Thank you.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Dave. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Advisors","Dave, I think you mentioned natural disasters and some political impact, which probably negatively impacted your developing markets, any way to quantify how much of an impact it had on the growth rate?","David Calhoun","Yes. Well, I\u2019m getting very used to the developing world in a very sort of consistent way growing around 18% for us. And so, as I mentioned to you, we were 15% on a year-on-year, and you really can attribute it to, again, Arab Spring that happened to move across all the seasons and Thailand, which as I said just literally stopped in its tracks. But those things I think we\u2019re going to feel better in the year ahead. And I don\u2019t have an accountant sitting next to me with this one, but to me I think it\u2019s around that two to three points.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Advisors","Okay. So mid-teens rate should be going forward do you think?","David Calhoun","It\u2019s certainly been performing that way and there\u2019s no reason for me to think it won\u2019t.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Advisors","Okay, great. And then just on your leverage ratio, you\u2019re at four times today, you got your upgrade in your credit rating. Any comments you can have as far as your long-term comfort or where you\u2019d want to see that ratio?","David Calhoun","We still like going down. We think it\u2019s healthy. We have always said investment grade is a good goal, and we\u2019re just going to keep running our play.","Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Advisors","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Liz Zale","Thanks Eric. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Could you give us some more color on your discussions with clients, what types of projects they are spending on, where are they pulling back?","David Calhoun","Well, pricing continues to be, I\u2019ll start with the U.S. market price, because that\u2019s where I think lots of change in terms of the brand dynamics and thoughts are. But there\u2019s no question in the pricing world, you\u2019ve got this market moving in two directions. You\u2019ve got a high end and a low end, the middle just seems to getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And I know you here most of our brand folks on the client side talking about this, but it\u2019s real, and the analytics are to try to support that. How do we appeal to sort of the low end of the economic chain and then how do we run towards the high end. And that\u2019s a big challenge for all of them, it really is. And so I would say pricing continues to be an important part of our work. And then the second one is mix models, everybody\u2019s trying to incorporate more digital mix into their advertising model. And those models and analytics to support that move is probably going to be the most robust analytic framework we have for the next several years, not just next year or this year.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And then just one other question, is your expectation for margin expansion next year that Watch should help fund potentially deteriorating margins in Buy, given the investments, or should we start to actually see margin expansion in Buy?","David Calhoun","Well, we don\u2019t think about deterioration. We just think about reinvestment. It\u2019s important, because they are very deliberate decisions we make around Buy business. And yes, 2012 will be another year where we are going to invest in our programs, particularly Global Reach and Read, to continue to extend the footprint. And that model is very consistent and robust and we feel good about the prospect. So, yes, the margin expansion of 30, 50 bps is a full investment mode number.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Liz Zale","Thanks, Sara. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","Wanted to ask how you\u2019d characterize the competitive environment around renewals for the Buy business and are you finding that pricing is becoming more or less rational?","David Calhoun","I\u2019m not sure how to frame that. I think the best way for me to say it is look we always face competitive battles. Our track record continues to be very good. We continue to make progress. In general, we come out ahead in every year\u2019s renewal and I don\u2019t forecast any change on that front. So nothing significant is happening on that front in terms of change year-over-year.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","Okay. And a question on, if you could give us an update on Nielsen Catalina Solutions, how that\u2019s going?","David Calhoun","Yes, actually, I\u2019m very enthused about it. It\u2019s part of our advertising solutions toolkit. As I mentioned, we now have a couple of $100 million of business in this arena, not just that product, but in that suite. And the Catalina Solutions product will really come into full force here in the second half of 2012. And I believe that that will be a significant part of our ad solutions growth. So, again, I feel very good about it. It took us longer to hatch than I probably originally contemplated, but for good reasons. And we have good business with it now and I expect the second half for it to be robust.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","And a last question, a housekeeping question. With the new debt facility in place, what does the blended cost of debt look like going forward?","Brian West","Well, as we closed the year, it was at 5.68%, and over time, as we continue to delever, we don\u2019t see that moving around a lot. Our focus actually is going to be going after the high coupon notes. And every day that passes, the economics get better and better with the ones that are callable. So we think it\u2019s in that zip code and it\u2019s going to only get better as we opportunistically seek to take out the high coupon notes.","Bill Warmington - Raymond James","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Bill. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bird of Lazard. Please go ahead.","William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets","For your Watch business, I was wondering if you could just talk about how soon could the upfront market move to three-screen and what would it mean for your business?","David Calhoun","It would mean a lot. It\u2019s not going to move there real soon. I believe that three-screens is still what everyone is after, for all the good reasons. The upfront and the dynamics around all those instant negotiations, in my view, present a hurdle for it, because I don\u2019t think the analytic community has yet fully accepted it. It\u2019s just going to take some time for it.","Look, I think last night\u2019s experience is going to educate an awful lot of folks on just what that means. And I\u2019m looking forward to sort of whatever comes as a result of that. But I think the screaming dimension with the media is, number one, property. And I think all that gets learned and then ultimately all that\u2019s been commercially implemented from it is going to be a great experience for everybody, including Nielsen.","William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets","Thank you.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Bill. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Doug Arthur - Evercore Partners","Well, just following-up on Bill\u2019s question. As the TV device gets more sophisticated, moves more towards smart TVs, which seems to be a very slow evolution, broadly speaking, do you see that as an opportunity or a threat to the watch business?","David Calhoun","Total opportunity. Look, we think about our metric, ultimately including all or what we refer to as best available screen for any family or any household. Believe it or not, it\u2019s rarely the technologies that represent hurdles in the implementation of this. It\u2019s really alignment of industry interest. And that\u2019s always been the case, and it continues to be the case. All that said, I believe that is exactly where we\u2019re going. And for us, every one of these additional screens, every one of these new forms of distribution, represent opportunities that are complementary to our currency. So at any rate, I view this as opportunity-rich.","Doug Arthur - Evercore Partners","Okay, great. Thank you.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Doug. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt Chesler - Deutsche Bank","I have a few questions. The first is one more follow-up to the multi-screen measurement issue. The London Olympics, I believe, are going to be a big petri dish for cross-platform measurement, as NBC is streaming it live, as well. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about your role, if any, that you\u2019re going to have in measuring the Olympics with NBC? And if you\u2019ve got any partners there, as well. I guess the second question would be a clarification on the EPS guidance range, in terms of the constant the FX assumption. Is that based off the FX rate, the January 1 rate? How should we think about that?","David Calhoun","Why don\u2019t you do the back one, because that\u2019s an easy answer?","Brian West","Yes. It\u2019s just like the 1\/1 rate.","David Calhoun","So, with respect to the Olympics, again, I believe last night is going to teach the industry a lot on this subject. We are definitely going to use the London Olympics as a huge test case and both with advertisers, with the Olympic committee and all involved. So this is always an opportunity for Nielsen to sort of showcase its global reach. More importantly, its reach across screens.","I will remind everyone on the multi-screen. The first thing you have to do before you do multi-screen is you\u2019ve got to get a great metric on the second screen. And that\u2019s what OCR is all about. You have to have some level of accountability and you have to have some high level of accuracy with respect to demographics in order to be able to combine it with what\u2019s in television. So these are definitely in step, and we feel very good about sort of both. First, just the second screen. And then secondly, the ability to integrate.","Matt Chesler - Deutsche Bank","Yes. I guess my understanding is that, certainly you would want to use that as a test case to prove out your capabilities. One other thing I was trying to drive at with the question is should we just be thinking about it as that? Or is this a commercial relationship where it might actually contribute to revenue growth in 2012? Then the follow-up would be can you talk about your M&A pipeline? Thanks.","David Calhoun","Well, the answer to first question is both. So yes, there\u2019ll be commercial arrangements. Is it going to move the needle in a really significant way? No, but it will be a positive influence. And yes, you\u2019re right. That case and the reach that we can ultimately achieve and what we do for these big multinational advertisers that should, we hope, present a case for then very big and ongoing relationships. And the second question was?","Matt Chesler - Deutsche Bank","It was around your M&A pipeline, in terms of what\u2019s your focus? What areas or capabilities do you think you want to bolster? Can you size that at all, in terms of what you think is a realistic range of spend this year?","David Calhoun","No. We told everyone and we continue to try to stay on track with sort of what we spent, we will continue to spend and look for. Last year was a perfect, in my view, indication of what we\u2019re trying to do. We had a acquisition built around geographic expansion when we bought MEMRB, and it covered Eastern Europe and covered parts of Russia, which are very complementary to what we do. There are still some of those left in the world, and we will continue to look for those. Great analytics platform that we bought called Marketing Analytics, which is where watch and buy data meet. In effect, marketing mix for most campaign managers.","And then we invested in a great new research tool called NeuroFocus, where they are just doing groundbreaking work in reading the brain. Believe it or not, that one is off to a fantastic start with us. And I feel very good about what that will contribute to Nielsen. And it will keep us on the leading edge of research. So each of those in their own way demonstrated sort of potential avenues for us to tuck-in acquisitions, bring in real entrepreneurs with real talent into the company. And again, I hope this year ends up looking exactly like that.","Matt Chesler - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Flynn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Couple questions. First one, sorry to go back to currency, but I want to ask another clarification question. The slide you have on guidance says that everything is in constant currency, but obviously, you\u2019re assuming January 1 rate. So I just want to clarify on that EBITDA margin expansion of 30 to 50, is that actually what you expect net of the currency impact? Or are you saying it\u2019s going to be less than that when you layer in currency?","Brian West","Well, that number is what it\u2019s going to be, if you assume rates were the same year-over-year. Rates probably aren\u2019t going to be the same year-over-year. They\u2019re going to go one way or the other. And that\u2019s going to naturally move to that number. So we don\u2019t try to guess at that. It\u2019s just when you look year-over-year, that will be consistent.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","But your EPS, I mean you have to guess somewhat your EPS implies the January 1 rate?","Brian West","That\u2019s the EPS number, because I have to.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Yes, so it\u2019s basically the EPS number reflects the currency, but the other two don\u2019t?","Brian West","Exactly.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","No. Okay.","Brian West","I don\u2019t know any other way to do it.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Yes, no, that\u2019s helpful. Okay. Thank you. And then just secondly on OCR, I know Suzy got an update in her question. But just to clarify, are you still in pilot mode, i.e. not charging? Or have you actually started charging clients yet?","David Calhoun","No, we\u2019ve got a few examples where we\u2019ve charged clients. But I consider our program to be in pilot mode. In other words, we are going to continue to build out a broad array of used cases, so that our model can reflect the value that it\u2019s delivering to the industry. And the longer we wait on that front, given the momentum we see on the use cases, the better off we are and the more comfortable our clients are going to be making these early rounds of investment.","So that\u2019s exactly the mode we\u2019re in. That\u2019s the way we continue to operate it. And what we\u2019re not going to do is try to put too much pressure on ourselves to jump before the use cases play out. At any rate, that\u2019s the mode. But we\u2019re further ahead than I thought we would be. I told you at the last call we had that I was going to start to feel good about the momentum here in this quarter. And if I were to guess then, I\u2019d tell you I\u2019m probably even more confident at this moment.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then can I ask you a third one on Wal-Mart? I think you said in your prepared remarks that the terms were complete. And you also said you\u2019re modeling some impact or positive impact this year. So just to clarify, is all or most of the financial impact this year resulting from an effective price increase for the data in the second half? Or are there other significant things that we should be thinking about? And then I mean would you give us a sense of what the price increase is? It sounds like you already know.","David Calhoun","Yes, we do, but I can\u2019t. But let me suggest it this way. Remember, this is a second quarter kind of implementation. So yes, there is additional revenue that is built into all the manufacturers who want the data. And as I said, substantially complete, as in really substantially complete. What implications are, for five or six months, we run mostly cost with nothing on the top-line. So we\u2019ve been running a sort of a, as Brian calls it, investment mode. But we\u2019ve been running on a sort of a tight basis because we are doing nothing more today than spending money to build the technical platform, cull the data, and implement it. And then we begin to catch up to that as we move throughout the second half of the year. And on balance, for the year, it definitely add to the top-line, it won\u2019t add much to the bottom-line, simply because of the first half, second half phenomenon.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Okay. But when you say the terms are complete, just to clarify, we will not start seeing revenue impact until the second half, is that right?","David Calhoun","Exactly.","Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Liz Zale","Thank you, Kelly. With that, I think we\u2019ve finished the question-and-answer. So I wanted to thank everyone for participating and turn it back over to the operator.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes Nielsen Holdings N.V., fourth quarter and full-year 2011 call. A replay of this call will be available on the Nielsen Investor Relations website shortly. Thank you and have a great day.","Liz Zale","Thanks, everyone."],"15730":["Nielsen Holdings PLC.

My name is Carol, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2019 Nielsen Holdings Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Sara Gubins","Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's second quarter financial performance. I'm here with our CEO, David Kenny and our CFO, Dave Anderson. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind all of you that our remarks and responses to your questions today may contain forward-looking statements, including those about Nielsen's outlook and prospects that are based on Nielsen's current expectations. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC, which are available on our website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.","On today's call, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, which is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at Nielsen.com. [Operator Instructions].","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, David Kenny.","David Kenny","Thank you, Sara. Thanks everyone for joining us. Let me tell with some brief high-level comments. I\u2019ll then let Dave review the second quarter results, and provide some color on our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. And then I'll come back for a brief update on our strategy and progress, in both media and connect and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Let me start with the strategic review. We expect to conclude the review by the time we report our third quarter and we look forward to sharing the outcome with you then if not earlier. The board and management are working as quickly as we can to conclude.","In the meantime in parallel, we continue to focus on driving improved results, and we're going to use the time today to update you on our progress in driving those results. So speaking of results, our second quarter results again, came in better than plan, which reflects improved operating discipline and Nielsen's ability to execute.","We had positive constant currency revenue growth in both media and connect. With a solid first half behind us, we are on track to deliver our 2019 revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range and Dave will run you through these details.","At a higher level, let me emphasize that we have two strong franchises that are essential to the media, retail and FMCG economies. Each of these businesses has greater potential and the actions that we're taking and our investments in growth position as well to achieve that potential.","We have made some important moves on our transformation to being a more product-driven technology company. First, we moved our core national television audience measurement processing to a modern cloud based infrastructure working alongside Amazon Web Services. The ability to now more easily scale big data sets will drive flexibility and velocity for our product development, which enables us to deliver more and enhanced value to our clients.","Secondly, on the Nielsen connect side, we are rolling out the Nielsen connect platform, which has transformed -- transformative for our clients. We recently went live with a very large client as their system of record and hundreds of clients are using key components of the platform. Our clients are excited about this, and our relationship with Microsoft Azure as our cloud partner is helping to be more essential to our clients and connect. And third, we continued to solidify around cross-functional leadership team, that focus on product components creating the most value for our clients as we continue our transformation into a product centric company.","Let me now turn the call over to Dave to review the quarter, and then I'll come back with an update on each of our segments.","David Anderson","Thanks, David. Let me start with the slide number five. I'm just take you through some of the highlights and you know what I think are some of the key takeaways. We're obviously pleased with the results for the second quarter, which were slightly ahead of expectations. It's really a tribute to the organization. If you think about the dynamic nature of the environment that we're operating and the fact that we're able to deliver these numbers we feel very very proud of.","Revenue grew 1.2% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in both Media and Connect in the quarter. Year-over-year margin rate improvement reflects better revenue, but also significantly the results of our productivity programs that are clearly working.","Adjusted EPS was $0.53 in the quarter. It was driven in part by EBITDA performance, but also helped by a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. I'm going to talk about that a little bit later when I talk about guidance for the quarter, coming as well as for the full year.","Free cash flow of $118 million came in within our expected range. So as a result, we're reiterating our revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow guidance for 2019. And as David said, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance, and again I'll provide some more insights on that in a few minutes.","If you go to slide number six, let's take a look at the second quarter highlights. Revenue of 1.2% growth for the quarter on constant currency, it compares to our expectation of flat to up slightly, so we're really pleased obviously with that performance. We saw improved trends in both Media and Connect in the second quarter, both growing year-over-year on a constant currency basis.","Revenue increase 0.7% on an organic constant currency basis, and if you exclude the impact of onetime items in the year ago period organic revenue grew 1.7%.","For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $470 million, that\u2019s up 2% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.9% up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis. And again, this compares to our expectation of roughly flat margins in the second quarter, so obviously very very pleased with that performance.","Now margins benefited from positive performance and productivity, partially offset by investments that we've made in our people and in our businesses, and we\u2019ve referenced both of those as you recall in our original guide for the year.","This is consistent with our first quarter performance and we believe will translate into full year benefit. And again, I'll talk more about that when we discuss full year guidance.","The second quarter tax rate of 15% was well below the prior 33% to 35% forecast for the full year and it relates specifically to several discrete items in the quarter, regarding both tax contingencies as well as settlement of a major tax audit. And if you exclude these items, our tax rate was 34% in the second quarter.","Adjusted EPF $0.53 compares to $0.47 in the second quarter of 2018, primarily again reflecting tax favorability offset by higher depreciation and amortization year-over-year.","Cash flow of $118 million compared to $124 million last year, largely in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we had lower restructuring, so we had some offset from working capital timing, primarily the timing of receipts versus the timing of payments in the quarter.","So overall the second quarter results reflect as David said, we think, very very good execution by the organization. And again, we want to thank our associates around the world for their focus, the hard work and their dedication during this period.","So now let's start with Media on slide number seven, just a few highlights of each of the two segments. Revenue for Media for the second quarter was $856 million. It was up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. If you adjust for M&A and the impact of TV brand effect, Media revenue would have been up 2.2% year-over-year.","Audience measurement was up 4.2% constant currency. We continue to see strength in National TV, double digit growth in digital. But as expected, local was down year-over-year and audio was down slightly year-over-year.","Plan optimized was down 3.3% constant currency. If you adjust for M&A and other items, it was down 2.6% compared to the second quarter last year. Significantly, the telecom business has been under pressure, and we also saw some pressure and grace note to a tough comparison in the second quarter.","Media\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $371 million, up 2.2% constant currency and importantly, margins at 43.3% for Media were up 7 basis points constant currency. So productivity more than offset some the incremental investments that we're making in this segment.","Going to slide eight, let\u2019s just briefly highlight connect performance. We saw strength in measure offset by some continued weakness in predict and activate. The connect revenue of $772 million was up 0.4% constant currency. The impact of M&A in the quarter for connect was minimal for onetime items from a year ago, were a drag on revenue of 90 basis points.","Revenue in measure was $546 million, up 1.7% constant currency. It reflects strong performance in our retail measurement services, and also some improved trends that we saw in the quarter in China. And notably, our omni channel and retailer initiatives are performing well.","Revenue in predict activate was $226 million; it was down 2.6 constant currency, but less of a climb that we saw in the first quarter. While we continue to see pressure in the short cycle consumer insights and innovation business, the declines have lessened significantly and we expect that level of improved performance in the second half of the year.","Developed markets revenue was down 0.4% in Connect constant currency. We continue to see declines in the U.S. and stable trends in Western Europe. Emerging markets were up 2% in the second quarter. China improved as I mentioned in the second quarter against a relatively easy comp last year. Now we expect China to continue to improve during the year helped by expanded coverage.","Connect adjusted EBITDA was $109 million, 0.9% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 14.1% up 8 basis points constant currency driven again by productivity initiatives.","So let's go now to slide nine talk about the outlook for 2019. We're maintaining our guidance as we said for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance.","This guidance includes, total company constant currency revenue flat to up 1.5%, Media and Connect are consistent with our previous guidance. I\u2019m going to spend just a little bit more time on that in just a minute.","We continue to see expected adjusted EBITDA margins in the 28% to 29%, but based on the first half performance in our outlook for the second half, we expect to be at or above the midpoint of that range for the full year, so adjusted EBITDA margin will be driven by significant productivity, partly again offset by reinvestments that we're making in the businesses.","Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. This compares to our previous range you recall of $1.63 to $1.77. So we've lowered our 2019 GAAP tax guidance to 28%-29% in light of the first half actuals, and also our expectation for second half GAAP tax rate in the range of 32% to 34%.","We've also lowered our forecast for interest expense given the current interest rate environment, but we've also increased our forecast for depreciation and amortization expense. This relates to timing of internally developed software initiatives and details around these changes are in the appendix of our slides.","Lastly, we're going to continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million and the midpoint to be roughly flat with to 2018. And as we've discussed the key drivers are going include for 2019 lower incentive comp, pay outs, lower retail payments offset in part by higher cash, net cash interest, and also cash taxes.","Turning now to Slide 10, the segment outlook for Media, we continue to forecast 2% to 3% constant currency revenue growth. We expect Audience Measurement to be the high end of the 2% to 3% revenue growth range, while plan optimize, we now forecast to be at the low end of the 1% to 2% range.","Telecom is a key pressure driver on the plan optimized outlook. In Connect, we continue to forecast revenue to be minus 2% to flat with measure coming in towards the high end of the minus one to plus one range, and predict activate in the previously provided minus 4% to minus 2% range.","Finally let's turn to Slide 11, let me talk about what we anticipate for the third quarter. Just give you a little bit of framework, in terms of how to think about what we're seeing and what we expect. We expect revenue in the third quarter to be up slightly year-over-year in constant currency. It includes the year-over-year growth rate accelerating the third quarter for Media and assumes a slight decline for Connect.","For the third quarter, we expect margins to be flat to down slightly year-over-year. We're seeing the benefit of productivity, which provides support for investment and growth initiatives such as digital in media, and the continued deployment of the Connect platform in Connect.","I'd also note that we continue to anticipate the conclusion of further tax audit in various countries in the second half. If this occurs similar to the second quarter, it could have a meaningful impact and translate to an effective book tax rate below the 32% to 34% guide that I reference for ETR for the second half of 2019.","And finally, we expect third quarter free cash flow to be flat to up slightly on a year-over-year basis. And as we discussed with you, we've got a lot of focus on cash in the organization.","So in summary, we're obviously very pleased with the second quarter and first half results. We're confident in our plan and the full year outlook for the -- hopefully come across with a commitment to deliver on all fronts. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.","And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to David for his further comments.","David Kenny","Thanks, Dave. I really appreciate everything. Let me say as I said before, that we have two strong franchises that are essential to the media and consumer packaged goods flash retail economy. We are taking actions to position each of our businesses for improved performance as we move ahead.","So let me focus on each segment. I'll start with Nielsen Global Media. Our metrics and data are essential to creating trust in the media ecosystem, providing media owners and advertisers with a clear picture of exactly who consume content and advertising, how many times, whether they are engaged and how this translates into growth for their business.","Since joining Nielsen, I have spent a lot of my time with CEOs and media owners, digital first company, advertisers and agencies around the world. What I hear is that media is more fragmented than ever before and the need for a single source of truth is more critical today than ever.","So I have increased conviction that the media industry needs one media truth across the entire value chain and that only Nielsen can do that. Looking at the business highlights, let's start with Audience Measurement. We thought swings in both linear TV and digital video measurement. Digital was driven by growth with our advertiser and agency clients, reflecting the critical nature of independent third party measurement and the further progress towards currency status across all platforms.","Demand is growing for audience based buying, which is selling high value target audiences in linear advertising, as advertisers seek to maximize their return on investment. Nielsen is a leader in this date. Our advanced audience solution provides much needed industry consistency, and transparency on advanced TV segments.","As one example we recently signed Horizon Media as the first agent and client for this solution, which unifies the planning, activation and measurement of audiences beyond age and gender. We're also focused on bringing the same level of transparency to addressable television, which uses dynamic ad in view to target ads 1:1.","We're leveraging our investment in the Gracenote APR technology and in Sorenson Media to bring a scalable solution to market, supporting the direction the market is headed.","Also, subscription video on demand is growing. You may have seen recent headlines about increasing competition as traditional media companies entered streaming.","Our clients are increasingly using Nielsen SVOD data to help maximize the value of their content. And here for a proof point, I would refer you back to Comcast last earnings call with David Virginia from data in discussing their decision to remove The Office from Netflix in order to stream it exclusively on their own platform.","And on Audio, we've also seen a lot of potential. Media is not only about what consumers watch it's about what they're listening to and consumers are listening across multiple platforms. We recently launched our Podcast Listener Buying Power Service which enables media sellers to better communicate their podcasting value proposition to advertisers. And in media --in Audio you're also collaborating with iHeartMedia in efforts to advance our audio measurement and attribution and we'll deeply integrate audio into our cross-platform analytic initiatives.","Let me turn to the plan after my side of media. As Dave mentioned, we expect Plan\/Optimize to come in at the lower end of the range. And I'm very focused on making sure we take all the right actions to improve both product and sales execution in order to realize the full value of our Plan and Optimize segment.","We have had some good client wins that demonstrate the ongoing need for solutions to help clients optimize their media spend in a complex marketplace. For example, we're doing innovative work across a broad range of clients, including Visa, Johnson & Johnson and a major consumer electronics company.","We're working with partners to provide our clients with actionable intelligence across a broad range of vertical, and we'll continue to expand on that. Nielsen's relationship with J.D. Power and auto is a great example along with our recently announced new strategic partnership with Quotient, a leading digital service provider of retailer transaction data.","And lastly, we're working on driving operational excellence with our Global go-to-market strategy for our ROI products which would allow us to provide long term strategy including risk and attribution asserting ourselves as one media truth across the value chain not only for measurement, but for planning and optimizing that media. Altogether, these actions are aimed at providing greater value to our clients and improve performance for Nielsen.","At Media, let me spend a minute on Global, which is another source of growth for us. We're excited about a recent expansion in our work with YouTube. We expanded advertising measurement on YouTube Mobile app with Digital Ad Ratings into 26 additional markets, so we now have a total of 34. This is a major step forward for Nielsen and for the industry, because it brings advertisers in these markets, the comparability, coverage and transparency they need to maximize the impact of their digital media around the world.","Facebook also mentioned Nielsen on their recent earnings call, citing our data to highlight the success of mobile first video ads on their platform in the U.K. another proof of Nielsen\u2019s essential values.","To sum up on media, there's never been a more important time for one media trip, plant or looking to transact in new and different way and we are enabling them to do this with trust and confidence. Audience measurement, the foundation of the Nielsen business remains solid across TV, audio and digital.","In Plan and Optimize, we are focusing on improving the value we offer to clients, which should drive accelerated growth, and Global remains a key opportunity as we bring more capability into the global market.","Let me now turn to Nielsen Global Connect. I've also been able to spend a lot of time recently with many of the world's largest retailers and fast moving consumer goods company. The common threat is that they are all focused on being more data driven, as the rise of e-commerce and product fragmentation impact the market.","Nielsen collects the most complete and robust data on consumer behavior, and we have the most advanced tools to make sense of that data through our Nielsen Connect platform. Along with the deployment of Nielsen Connect, we are also investing in our go-to-market organization with clearer accountability between delivery, service and sales. And we are seeing that this is already positively impacting results as our organizational model matures.","In the second quarter, we made progress on these key initiatives and drove positive revenue growth. Let me talk about some of the business highlights. On the measure side of connect, we continue to strengthen our offerings on top of our unique position in the global marketplace. More than 70% of our connect revenue comes from non U.S. markets.","The U.S. turnaround continues to be a big focus, and we significantly strengthen our U.S. market position compared to where we were at this time last year. Our progress on the Nielsen Connect platform, retailer collaboration programs, coverage enhancements, including e-commerce, including omni channel, and the modernization of our operations in both developed and emerging markets is leading to productive renewal discussions, and new customer acquisitions.","Let me provide an update on the retail side of this. In addition to our successful program, which we continue to grow in Walmart and Sam's Club, earlier this year we launched a vendor collaboration program with Meyer Inc, a regional supercenter chain where we serve as the preferred partner.","This month, we expanded that program to include a bundle of connect platform apps switching naval data to be accessed by more users and delivering increased speed to insights for Meyer and its partners.","Our retailer programs are leading to strong growth, also with long tail manufacturer clients who find it\u2019s easy to work with. Coverage expansion is also a continued focus, and let me highlight three areas there. First, in e-commerce, Nielsen is the industry leader in the United States, with the largest e-commerce panel providing top manufacturer and retailer client with the e-commerce measurement they need to run their businesses, and we're making big progress in a number of other markets on e-commerce ranging from China to Turkey.","Second, earlier this month, we launched our total U.S. tech retail channel measurement increasing our coverage in this important and growing phase. And lastly, another big market China, we're undertaking the largest coverage enhancement in Nielsen China's history to better capture the impact of rapid urbanization and shifting population.","And the reaction to these upcoming improvements has been positive from both our local and multinational clients working in China. On the predict activate side, our trajectory also improved in the second quarter but as the plant optimized, we do have the potential.","To enable this, we are focused on leveraging our measurement data and the Nielsen Connect platform to provide scaled analytics to clients, specifically around our suite of analytic services that help clients with distribution, assortment, pricing and trade promotion. Retailers and CPG manufacturers across the globe are now utilizing these new skills and services and the feedback has been quite strong.","This ranges from global manufacturers such as Unilever and Johnson & Johnson that are working with us across multiple European markets, local clients such as Yili, the Chinese dairy manufacturer and retailer Carrefour and [indiscernible] in Latin America and Auchan in Russia.","In the United States the use of the Connect platform have increased significantly over the last quarter by our retail partner. Retailers that represent over two-thirds of the revenue in the U.S. CPG industry are now using Nielsen's machine learning merchandising application to reset their assortment so that the right everyday prices and optimize their promotion.","As we ramp up these scaled analytic services, we are also investing in our marketing and sales team to drive momentum in this under penetrated suite of services in both our developed and emerging markets.","Let me sum up on Connect. Retailers and manufacturers are both looking increasingly for data driven solutions to help them compete more effectively. Nielsen has the key initiatives in place that strengthen our competitive position, and allow us to add more value to these clients. We are executing well, and we have more we can do to accelerate growth.","Let me turn to the profit side, and talk about operations and productivity. This is an equally important area of focus, as it creates the ability to invest in key growth initiatives. As Dave mentioned, our productivity program are working.","In media as I mentioned, migrating our core national television audience to the cloud was a key milestone in modernizing our infrastructure and driving productivity. And in Connect, we are making good progress on the product tech rationalization with a focus on rightsizing our on-premise footprint. We're executing well in our field automation and we're also growing throughput in our three super hubs, which are far more productive than the prior model.","Let me sum up, first of all as I said at the beginning, we are working hard on the strategic review, which we expect to conclude by the time we report our third quarter, if not before. I hope you'll understand that we don't have anything more to say about the review today.","At the same time, our organization is rallying around the key initiatives we have in place to achieve greater potential in both media and connect. Our solid first half gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2019 guidance, and we are making investments necessary to generate greater growth, profitability and shareholder value over the longer term.","And I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Let me not going back to Sara for Q&A.","Sara Gubins","Thanks, David. Carol, can we open up the lines for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly.[Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Good morning. What's led you to\u2026","David Kenny","Good morning, Toni.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. What's led to the increased confidence that you'll complete the review by the third quarter earnings? I know you could set sort of whatever deadline you want, but I guess what's made you determine that it's imminent and relatedly today you seem to have talked about the two segments as two businesses a little bit more separately than you have in the past.","So maybe I'm reading too much into it, but are you suggesting that you're finding in the review that the best way to unlock value is for the businesses to be separate? Thank you.","David Kenny","Yes, listen, I\u2019m not going to comment on that hypothetical split. And as I said on the call today, we do expect the review to be concluded by the time we report in the third quarter. There's really nothing more to say, the confidence is just because we've made good progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is Jude [ph] on for Andrew.","David Kenny","Good morning.","David Anderson","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","We appreciate the additional color in terms of the timing for the strategic view. I wanted to ask a business strategy question, that perhaps you've been able to reflect on through the review. We were wondering what you've learned about the business at this juncture through the review in particular, what areas of the company have been most intriguing to other firms even you\u2019ve been in talks about what areas have given them room for pause, and maybe how have these perspectives helped shape your business strategy going forward? Thanks.","David Kenny","Yes, I think the review's been helpful and so has been all the client input. I think it's given us a lot of confidence in the value of one media truth and the need to connect those dots and our role in the overall industry. And I think, certainly anybody who's looked into business, sees just how essential we are, which has given us great confidence in the franchise. And I would say on the connect side; I think there's also been a view that there are changes. E-commerce is growing and there is a need for a more complex data set, which Nelson has.","And I also believe some of our modernization has been important to understand how we can provide that productively and how we can connect with the other systems that retailers are using. So I\u2019d say the market demand has been very positive, and I think anybody who invests in the company including all of you should understand just how essential Nielsen is. I\u2019d say as we dig deeper I think we've also learned a lot about our operations and how to improve our operations. And I think having a deep dive has certainly made us a stronger company operationally and organized more of our data in a consistent easy loose manner by our operators.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, you have Ryan [ph] on for George. I just had a question around your margin target. I know back at your Investor Day in 2017, you'd a longer term target of approximately 35% driven by some of your cost savings and productivity improvements, but obviously it's been you know a little bit lower than that in the recent quarter, so do you think that 35% is still an appropriate target, or has that number change as you're looking to reinvest to support growth?","David Kenny","Yes we really haven't established or reestablished long term targets for the company and certainly nothing that we as you know we've communicated externally. The focus is, as David said, it's really on execution right now with a lot of priorities that are translating to the results that you see and importantly not only slightly ahead of our expectation, ahead of prior year, in terms of EBITDA margin, while supporting reinvestment in the business.","But as I said in our guide for the full year outlook, we expect now to be at the mid to the upper end of the guidance range, that we had previously communicated. The 28% -- to 29% for 2019. So yes, we're really -- we're really focused on that and obviously very very committed to delivering around that. So that's that's really I think the sum and substance of where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Can you hear me?","David Kenny","Yes, we can.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, thanks for taking the questions. This is Ryan on for Manav. It's just a question on you know obviously we've seen a lot of issues around kind of privacy and some of the publishers themselves with how they treat data. Have you seen any opportunity in the past year or so just regarding kind of your third party nature, and any opportunities or just given your expertise especially on the privacy side?","David Kenny","Yes. Certainly I would say on the Media side. As everybody's been dealing with privacy, it has I think caused all the players to have value in independent third party measure one that can be done without Pii, and that can be done with things like panels, which are very privacy-friendly and reluctant. And I also think as everybody needs to transact with each other having a single truth so that as a currency has become more important in more aspects of media. So certainly, I think privacy in a broader kind of legislative environment around that certainly does create more need for Nielsen and more need for independent third party validation.","I would say on the connect side, we're also seeing that it\u2019s -- as folks get more personalized in their advertising, they want to have a better truth set of what's going on in market share, our investments in coverage, our investments in e-commerce, our investments to look at this globally has certainly been more important to advertisers as they become more data driven, and to retailers as they become more data driven on the connect side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Salmon","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, I wanted to ask a little bit about Amazon. We know they are an important client already as they become a bigger player in Media and Advertising but their core business is accounting for an increasing share the type of commerce that\u2019s important to connect, however, they are not still not a partner in new methodology in quite the same way say Walmart is. So I wanted to ask about your broader relationship with Amazon both as a customer and a partner how that\u2019s evolving and then of course the news in the quarter it was the move to AWS and would just love to hear more detail on that for your business but also how that may affect the relationship or your trajectory with \u2013 trajectory of your relationship with Amazon. Thank you.","David Kenny","Well listen, I you know -- I think Amazon needs to speak for itself. We don't generally talk about specific partners in great detail. We let them do that. So what I would say is there's a very good relationship across Amazon. I think as they as you say is there in categories that we cover on the connect side there is a good relationship around the world on that, as they make investments like Whole Foods that also creates an opportunity, so we work well. I think, AWS is the media platform. It's two sides, the Amazon, I would -- I would say there's it's not you know totally link between the two sides, but I would say they are a good partner and we're working increasingly, productively with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Noland from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Timothy Noland","Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask on the Media side, it seems you're getting a bit more into some actual media buying. I think the acquisition of Sorenson perhaps gets you a bit more into that space. Your business traditionally has been third party independent measurement, but now correct me if I'm wrong, but you are getting a bit more into let\u2019s called the activation of that. I just wonder, do I have that right. Is this a strategic shift? Is this something that really enhances the business and does it change your relationships with any of your traditional customers at all?","David Kenny","Yes, I think you might be extending too far. We clearly believe that one media truth required independent third party measurement, and for us to not be a principal actor in buying. Sorensen is a set of technologies which enable, addressable TV buying and selling. And so we'll be enabling that, and licensing that, but we're not going to have a principal position. I think the market's counting on us to be the scorekeeper and referee of media, not playing on the field.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","Oh hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can I, maybe Dave explore a little bit with you on the tax deck side stepping back a little bit. It seems to me that to achieve your vision of A, I think you say product-driven technology company that the technical underpinnings are super important to achieve that. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on the technology you inherited and how that has been designed and we saw obviously the move to AWS which you were just talking about, and how that compares to if you could build it from scratch yourself, what it would look like to be ideal for what you want to do, which brings me to the heart of the question, which is, what will it cost you overtime to get from where you are today to where you would like to or need to be and how will you evaluate the ROI on that? We'd love your thoughts, thanks a lot.","David Kenny","Yes. So listen so if you could start from today, you know technology has evolved a great deal and you start with a collection of collection of well-built micro services, with interchangeable components living on public cloud if it's scaled to the Earth, to the moon, at no incremental cost. But we don't have a chance of starting from today. We have a legacy system like all legacy companies. And I think conversely, our legacy is a great strength, because our years of history our knowledge of data are establishing the currency are also important. So we have to manage on migration in that direction. And it's a migration that other legacy companies need to do and quite honestly, you know to be talking about public cloud in 2019 it's a bit late, but we're getting there. And what I would say, I'm encouraged about is the company really rallied in the last seven months to take a bunch of very good plans that existed and move and move quickly, and we've gotten partners to step up to help us to do that.","So we are moving to exactly that kind of system, which is a single architecture across our media platforms and quite honestly there's an architecture across connect to single data like services that can be reused, which allow us to scale at a much faster rate. So it can get there. I think, either you know there's plenty of history of companies that have migrated a legacy over, it just takes conviction and courage and quite honestly, a fair amount of top down management. I am very impressed by the tech team at Nielsen. I think that some of these investments were smartly made before I got here, and I really enjoyed rolling up my sleeves with them and engaging on how we get there. And I think the whole companies rallied to do that. So, I think, I think we're in very good shape. We're actually a little ahead of where I would have hoped to have been six months into my tenure, but we have ways to go.","In terms of cost, I think the good news about this migration is the technology has evolved far enough that you can do it without sort of some big increase in expense and then you push it out the other end. We don't have to redo everything. We're migrating things over time. I highlighted the movement of the core ratings, because that's a big module and it shows we can move. We can move the biggest and hardest things and make them work well in a modern architecture and still hit our numbers.","So this is just being baked into the way we operate the business. We don't intend to come tell you we need a big restructuring or something to get there. We're just taking this into the way we design our products.","David Anderson","And David, just maybe just add quickly to that. It's a really good point, because it's consistent I think Todd with what we've discussed today, which is you know productivity is so key, generating gross productivity it allows us to reinvest in terms of priority for growth initiatives as well as David said in terms of the technology or call it the technology transformation.","So that's that's the roadmap that we've developed a roadmap to the creative, we want to manage that intelligently and still deliver the kind of you know the kind of earnings at or above consistent levels. And that's, that's what we're focused on doing.","David Kenny","Yes. The last thing I'd say is, the thing I'm celebrating internally now would point out being from the year ago. We're celebrating when we sunset technology and turned it off. That's the way that you migrate without having cost. The challenge is to try to maintain the old system and the new get duplication. So we are very focused and celebrating the retirement of old technology and that's actually how I think you'll see us become modern much faster and while still hitting the margin targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ashish Sabadra","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So we saw Connect positively turned inflict \u2013 the connect growth inflicted positive in the quarter which is good. When you talked about slight decline in Connect in the third quarter, just wanted to better understand is that just conservatism just given that you continue to see improvement in China? Anything in particular, which will cause the growth to decline again in the third quarter? Thanks.","David Kenny","Yes. I don't think there's really anything that stands out there. I think you know overall this we're very very pleased with how the business has performed to demonstrate growth in the second quarter. We're really talking about, I think just a little bit of variability you know on a quarter-over-quarter basis, something that has to do with a tougher comp in the third quarter of last year. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't read too much into that just to make sure that you guys have an expectation in terms of how the compare is going to be third quarter revenue for Connect compared to prior year.","But that's nothing that, I wouldn't point out any single geography or any particular item related to that guide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Surinder Thind","Good morning, guys. When I kind of look at the midpoint of your guidance and I look across both segments, both media and connect, it seems like you're seeing stronger results in the measurement, which is the hard data, and arguably the more discretionary offerings are on planning or maybe seeing at the low end of that guidance.","Any color you can provide here is there just a bit of a wait and see approach that you see perhaps from clients or any color would be helpful?","David Kenny","Yes. So first of all, in the in the plan optimized side of media predict activate. There were a series of acquisitions made over time. I have not seen all the work done on integrating those into a single platform. That is what we're in the middle of. And that's a place for \u2013 going to ask you we\u2019re a little behind where I would have hoped to be, but we're on it and we're making good progress, because you have to have the platform built in order to sell them. So I would say we've got some product execution to integrate that.","And then I would say, on the go-to-market you know it's a different muscle, sometimes different buyer. So I would say, it's largely execution on both product and go-to-market. We are all over that, to make sure that we realize the potential there. These are really important segments for our future, and I think delivering on our purpose about one media proved to be delivering on our purpose around really helping to create markets in the consumer space. We have to do both sides, and we have the tools, and we have the pieces. We just need to put them together into one solution, which is why that tech modernization is actually very tied to the performance in those segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Kramer from Arete Research. Please go ahead.","RichardKramer","Thanks very much. Just a quick one. What more can you do to get more access to in app inventory and to understand better the audience that it's within apps. It seems to be an area where you will see increasing amounts of time and audience shift. And I'm wondering what more tech prior to acquisitions or technology you could do to get access to that audience to rate it properly? Thank you.","David Kenny","Yes. It's a great question. Thank you. Technically, you know we certainly are focused with panels on things like streaming leaders so that we understand what stream. So when they uplift the video and the video stream, we've got ways of knowing that certainly some of the technologies like ACR help us as well. So we are -- we're certainly I think building the core technology around that to make sure that whether it's in the home or out of home that we're getting that metrics. And I think they continue to get stronger, which is why you know earlier I mentioned companies who were mentioning it on their earnings report. Those were all videos and apps that they were quoting. So I think we are certainly providing the best data on that and we continue to work to make that better.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Kenney for closing remarks.","David Kenny","Hey, thank you. And thank you for the great questions, I appreciate it. To sum up, we are working hard on the strategic review, which we expect to conclude by the time we report our third quarter. If not before. And I hope you'll understand that we don't have more to say about that today. But I would also say that as I have spoken to our clients, both large and small, it's crystal clear that reliable data sets, key sources of truth are increasingly essential to great decision making.","So not just key to driving growth for our clients, but they also help power, a healthy media and consumer market around the world. In addition, we're working hard to align around the key initiatives that will enable our clients to make great decisions for their businesses, long into the future. I look forward to speaking to all of you soon about the outcome of our strategic review. And meanwhile thank you for joining us and let us get back to execution. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2018 Nielsen Holdings Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's third quarter financial performance. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, I'd like to remind all of you that our remarks and responses to your questions today may contain forward-looking statements, including those about Nielsen's outlook and prospects that are based on Nielsen's current expectations.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and a subsequent report filed with the SEC, which are available on our website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.","On today's call, we with also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable of GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release which is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at nielsen.com.","For Q&A, as always, we ask you to limit yourself to one question, only so we can accommodate everyone. Feel free to join the queue again, and if time remains, we will call on you. And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our Executive Chairman, Jim Attwood.","James A. Attwood - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Sara. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call today. I'm here with Dave Anderson, our newly appointed CFO; Megan Clarken, President of Watch; Pat Dodd, who oversees Buy and all international markets; and John Tavolieri, who oversees U.S. Buy and Technology and Operations. Megan, Pat, and John are all long-time veterans of Nielsen, and we thought it would be helpful for them to share their perspectives on this call. I'll make some brief opening remarks and then turn the call over to Dave for a review of the third quarter financials and to share his perspectives on the company.","First, the strategic review. As we announced in September, the board of directors expanded the scope of our previously announced strategic review of the company's Buy segment to include a broad review of strategic alternatives for the entire company and its businesses. As we've stated, the strategic review could result in a broad range of alternatives, including continuing to operate as a public, independent company; a separation of either Nielsen's Watch or Buy segments; or a sale of the entire company.","We are working with a great deal of focus and urgency on this review and have engaged a team of expert outside advisors, including JPMorgan, Guggenheim, BCG and Wachtell Lipton, to assist us in a fulsome analysis of our historical and forward-looking financials as well as our strategy, markets and strategic alternatives. Our board, with the assistance of our advisors and management, is engaged in directly overseeing the strategic review, and we've also designated a group of independent directors to meet regularly with our advisors and members of management to help drive the process. We do not have any additional details to share at this point, but we are working expeditiously and will provide further updates as appropriate.","Second, the CEO search. This is a parallel process to the strategic review, and the search is well under way. I must say I've been very impressed with the quality of the candidates we've seen to date. The recent hire of Dave is a testament to our ability to attract top talent, despite some obvious challenges in the business.","As you know, Mitch Barns will remain as CEO through the end of the year or until a new CEO is appointed. Mitch continues to be actively engaged in driving the business forward on a day-to-day basis. We thank Mitch for his dedication and continued commitment to Nielsen and all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.","Third, we made a fantastic hire with Dave Anderson, who joined us in September. Dave is well-known to the investment community from his 11-year tenure at Honeywell, one of the world's largest industrial companies. Throughout his career, he has helped develop and successfully implement strategies for growth and operational improvements in extremely complex environments. Dave is a tremendous addition to our team and has hit the ground running.","Before I turn the call over, I want to also thank the teams at Nielsen for their focus and dedication. It has been a challenging year, and there has been a lot of change in the organization. Despite this, the teams have demonstrated a remarkable ability to keep their heads down and focus on executing our strategic priorities. My sincerest thanks to everyone on the Nielsen team.","Now I'll hand it off to Dave, someone who's been pretty busy these last few weeks. Dave?","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Jim, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Jim, appreciate your kind words. Thank you for that. I'm impressed by the level of engagement and commitment that's being shown across Nielsen, and you're going to hear that come through particularly when Megan, Pat, and John speak later this morning. So I've had the opportunity over the last seven weeks to dig a little deeper into the business. I've spent time with a number of leaders across the company, and before I get into the financial review, I'd like to just share some high-level thoughts with you on that.","So, if you go to slide 7, again, at a high level, what I've provided here is just a view of headwinds and tailwinds for the company as I see them today. First, clearly, the end markets are changing with media fragmentation in Watch, changing consumer behavior, the growth of channels such as e-commerce, and increased competition in Buy, our clients' needs are ever-changing and at a rapid pace. We all understand that. We all get it. And it's critical that we evolve our business along with the ecosystems we serve in order to maintain our competitive positioning and our innovative offerings.","With that backdrop, one of the things in the center of the financial plate that we have to address is planning and forecasting. Our business has a lot of moving pieces. We're examining all of that as part of our review of planning and forecasting systems and processes. Our goal is to provide you with clarity on the range of outcomes that represent our guidance are in our best judgment, and then to deliver against that.","Lastly, with our CEO search and the strategic review under way, there are a lot of demands on the time in the organization that aren't tied to day-to-day operations. However, our business leaders remain focused on execution and active engagement with our clients as we also deliver on all fronts.","Turning to the right-hand side of that slide, talk a little bit about some of the tailwinds. We'd all agree that Nielsen has a terrific global franchise providing mission-critical data. I don't need to remind all of you that the major global enterprises as well as local businesses that we serve put their trust and confidence in Nielsen's data, analysis, insights and people every day. You're going to hear a lot more evidence of that today in the updates from the business leaders.","The strength of the company's operating leaders and their broader teams is impressive. I can assure you that this team gets up every day focused on the very best for our clients, working to make us stronger, faster, more agile, and more aggressive. To sum up the page, we know that credibility is built with time. It's built with consistent execution and also consistent and clear communication. That's our goal. Again, we have a strong commitment to deliver on all fronts.","With that, I'd like to turn to slide 8 and just take you through, before going into the financials this morning, take you through a set of CFO priorities. Obviously, first and foremost, the focus of the organization is executing on 2018. We're engaging the global management team in an operational review to examine all of our processes, working to ensure that we have the right cadence, rigor, and line of sight to deliver results. And, obviously, we're pleased with the start to that with the third quarter numbers that we're going to review with you today. I see the finance function as a strategic lever for helping drive operational excellence and also ensure accountability across the organization.","Next, obviously, we're working on developing an aggressive yet achievable 2019 operating plan. This will serve as the foundation for our future outlook. This involves a comprehensive bottom-up approach to planning, along with a fresh look at resource allocation, both CapEx and OpEx, and a review of our capital allocation strategy at the board level. Our goal is be as transparent as possible. We're early in the planning process, so we'll be limited in our comments today about 2019 at this time.","And third, as Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, is the strategic review. This goes hand in hand with the 2019 operating plan. It'll serve as the foundation for our long-term forecasting. Leveraging the work that we do here will provide the board with an informed point of view as they explore a broad range of alternatives. We're working with urgency, which includes a dedicated internal Nielsen team as well as outside experts.","And finally, strengthened communications with investors, I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of you already and the themes have been consistent in terms of feedback that you've provided to me. I know and we know how important transparency and clarity are to you. You have our commitment that this is going to be a top priority. We're going to seek your inputs on the redesign of our financial reporting framework, and I'm going to talk more about that a little bit in a few minutes at the end of my remarks.","So, with that introduction, let's dive into the results on slide 9. And importantly, obviously, the takeaway is we're very pleased with revenue, EBITDA, and EPS being on track. We're also very focused, as I'll talk in my remarks, on cash flow. On the left side of the page are the results on a U.S. GAAP basis, as you can see, revenue at $1.6 billion was down 2.5% on a reported basis. This was driven by growth in the Watch segment, offset by continued softness in Buy and 190 basis point of foreign currency drag in the quarter.","Net income on a GAAP basis, $96 million; net income per share, $0.27, down from $0.41 last year. Net income per share results were driven by softer revenues, prior restructuring charges, retailer investments, and other growth initiatives, again, consistent with that guidance that we provided you in July.","Looking at the right-hand side of the page, total revenue was down 0.6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $471 million was down 7.5% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.4%. Margins, of course, were impacted by revenue softness as well as the investments in our growth initiatives. This was partially offset by our productivity initiatives and John's going to take you through that in a few minutes.","Free cash flow was $266 million for the quarter, down from $425 million a year ago. It was driven by lower net income and working capital changes, including a drag due to receivable sales and higher cash restructuring. So, again, pleased that we're on with the revenue and EBITDA and EPS, and obviously focused on cash flow.","Turning to Watch, let me give you a few highlights there. We're obviously seeing some continued underlying strength, very pleased by that, and this is being partially offset by continued privacy and GDPR headwinds. Revenue for Watch in the quarter was $845 million, up 1.4% on a constant currency basis. Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 5.2% constant currency. Revenue from National TV clients continues to grow at a mid-single-digit run rate. We also saw strength in the quarter in digital and low double-digit growth in Gracenote. In the fourth quarter, importantly, we expect our revenue trend in this space to slow, given by pressure on digital client spend, on products related to targeting. It will also be impacted by a slowdown in Gracenote's growth and some pressure in local.","Marketing Effectiveness was down 10% constant currency, 10.1%, or down roughly 12% from third quarter last year when netting the Visual IQ acquisition, but also the exit of TV Brand Effect. The results were disappointing and primarily reflect the impact of changes in the consumer data privacy landscape as we called out last quarter.","Now, we expect Marketing Effectiveness in the fourth quarter to be down more than the third quarter, given continued pressure from changes in privacy as well as the fact that we had a tough comparison from historical data sales last year. I'd also note that we don't get the lift in the fourth quarter from the acquisition of the Visual IQ business, which was acquired in October of 2017.","Looking next at Audio, it was down 1.6% in the quarter, as expected. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $377 million, down 2.8% constant currency. Adjusted margins were down 44.6% or 196 basis points. A number of moving pieces contributed to the decline with revenue softness and product mix both being important factors.","Now, given those highlights on Watch, let's turn to the Buy segment, and the theme here is obviously the continued pressure on our end markets. The teams are obviously working on growth initiatives to mitigate these pressures. Third quarter Buy revenue was $755 million, down 2.7% constant currency, no impact from acquisitions. Revenue in the Developed Markets, $481 million, down 0.8% constant currency. Now, we continue to see weakness from global multinationals. While we were pleased with the third quarter performance in Developed Buy, we expect to see greater decline in this space in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter last year was also helped by the timing of some historical data sales. So that represents a tougher comp for us.","Revenue in Emerging Markets for Buy was $269 million, down 2.5% constant currency. We continue to see pressure on multinational client spend and also some additional softness in China. Pat's going to go into this in more detail when he discusses Emerging Markets and also our work to restore growth in China. Now, Buy adjusted EBITDA was $109 million, down 19.9% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 14.4%. This was driven by revenue declines and also by continued investments in our growth initiatives.","Let's go now to slide 12 and talk about overall guidance for 2018 and I'll take you through some of the line items. We've shown our previous guidance on the left-hand side of the page and the updated guidance on the right side. Again, we're reiterating revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and GAAP EPS. And as you can see, we've lowered the free cash flow guidance and again, I'll give you a few details on that in just a moment.","On revenue, I want to point out that while we continue to expect full-year company revenue to decline roughly 1% constant currency, we expect Buy revenue to be slightly better and Watch revenue to be slightly below our prior expectations due to some of the factors I described earlier. We're still guiding to a 34% tax rate, but we could see some variation in the fourth quarter due to true-ups to the adjustment made as a result of the 2017 corporate tax reform.","Moving to free cash flow, when we look at the major elements of free cash flow, including adjusted EBITDA, CapEx, and restructuring, they're all within the range of the July guidance. The exception really is working capital. And as a result of that, we're looking deeper to understand both third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter that has led us to lower our full-year free cash flow guidance to $450 million to $500 million. Obviously, it's a key element of forecasting and planning that I mentioned earlier.","And by the way, you should know that the assumption that we're using for accounts receivable sales is no increase on a year-over-year basis \u2013 a very small increase on a year-over-year basis, so FY 2018 compared to 2017, there's no significant driver benefit there. For your reference, we've included additional 2018 financial metrics and a currency adjustment map in the appendix. You also see in our reconciliation that changes in foreign exchange assumptions impact the expectations for reported revenue as well as EBITDA.","So, with that discussion of the results and the guidance, let's go to slide 13. There's just one final page that I'd like to just share with you. So, as part of the reporting process, we're considering enhancements to how we report and what metrics we use. It's still a work in process, but you can see some preliminary thoughts that include: number one, adding non-GAAP EPS metric; two, ensuring that we have consistency and alignment on organic revenue, so going to a transparent, understandable and consistent organic revenue measure; making sure we have relevant segment reporting \u2013 I think it's an opportunity to stand back, look freshly at that; and adding some color around quarterly expectations to supplement our annual guidance. We look forward to getting your input on these items and other items as we more fully implement them as we provide 2019 guidance with our fourth quarter results.","So, with that financial summary, let me turn it over to the business leaders, starting with Megan. Megan, do you want to take us through the highlights?","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, thanks, Dave, and good morning to everybody. On slide 15, we'll lay out our third quarter highlights and strategic priorities for 2019 for you. Let me summarize the highlights here. Firstly, Total Audience. Our National TV clients are growing at a mid-single-digit run rate due to our investment in Total Audience, which help them navigate and monetize the increasing complexity of the media landscape. We recently signed up new contracts with two of our largest, most strategic national media clients, securing our position as their trusted partner in the marketplace for years to come. And that's my second bullet point there. I'll spend some time on privacy and its impact on Marketing Effectiveness. That's my third bullet.","The consumer data privacy landscape has been a big area of focus for both Nielsen and the industry. So, let me unpack the dynamics for you. As consumer data privacy changes went into effect in late May, our publisher and platform data partners changed their requirements for how data is sent and received. This resulted in third-party data being switched off until both we and our data partners retooled capabilities.","With the bulk of the work to meet the new policies now behind us, we're shifting our focus back to our sales pipeline and new product offerings. In addition, many advertisers stopped targeting ads and sharing data until they felt that they were privacy compliant. This is an external factor that's impacted us. Longer term, we see strong client demand for a Multi-Touch Attribution, outcomes-based measurement and targeting. And recent multiyear renewals of large enterprise clients for Multi-Touch Attribution deals underscore our optimism here.","So let's go to the right-hand side of the page, where I'll talk about strategic priorities. I'll spend more time on this first point. Our clients have a range of strategies from brand awareness to audience-based buying, to direct targeting of individuals on personal devices, which require a range of metrics and measures. Through our Total Audience framework, we've built a solid foundation of exactly who saw and how many times they saw using standard comparable de-duplicated cross-platform measurements. These are the foundational currency metrics of C3\/C7 and Digital Ad Ratings, and they allow our clients to build additional metrics on top of these currencies.","We've recently branded this as Metrics to Monetize. For example, in audience-based buying in linear TV, Nielsen data is critical to clients whether they're targeting age and gender demos or, say, new moms. Nielsen's currency metrics provide the base to size the audience and provide the understanding of how many times that audience has actually seen the advertising. And without that, there is no ability to truly measure ROI. Nielsen is the only one who measures people, so we're the only ones who know exactly how many new moms there are. So bottom line here is that without Nielsen's base metrics of who saw and how many times they saw, it's impossible to fully measure targeted audience outcomes or any other metric used to monetize.","Next, we're doing well on the evolution of Digital. We're proud to announce we've signed a new agreement with Comcast to measure its users, digital viewing across the Xfinity Stream mobile apps and websites. This aggregated viewership data will contribute to Nielsen's Digital Content Ratings and Digital and TV Ratings.","And then, finally, across our portfolio, we'll continue to invest in innovation and client delivery. These are the cornerstones of our strategy in the Watch business. And with that, I'll turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Dodd - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Megan. I lead our international markets. This includes the entirety of Emerging Markets as well as Developed Markets, excluding the U.S., which John will talk about in just a few moments. Turning to slide 17, on our highlights, let's first talk about Developed Markets outside the U.S. Revenue trends have been relatively stable, including Europe, which represents nearly 40% of our Developed Market revenue. Here, we've been successful in adding new retail cooperators in all channels of trade as we continually build out the most comprehensive and complete measurement available for our clients. A recent notable win is Aldi in five European markets. We're focused on further expanding our relationship with this key fast-growing discount retailer.","Second of all, Emerging Markets, our clients continue to prioritize their investments in emerging markets, giving strong tailwinds such as population growth, rising middle class, and urbanization. However, a theme we talked about last quarter is large multinational spending pressure in Emerging Markets, and that did persist in Q3. The pressure was more pronounced in short-cycle revenue, such as consumer survey research and innovation. We continue to be focused on enhancing our measurement and analytic offerings, including greater coverage of the important traditional trade channel, which will continue to shift our portfolio mix in Emerging Markets towards long-cycle, highly-differentiated revenue streams. In China, we're focusing on the core, which includes a significant panel expansion, which I'll talk more about when I address strategic priorities for Emerging Markets.","As we move to the right-hand side of the page, expanding measurement and e-commerce are two top priorities for us internationally. Retailers are key to our continued success across both Developed and Emerging Markets as we drive to offer wider coverage and deeper granularity for our clients. This year, in 2018, we will add 200 more retailers into our measurement services across our international markets. Forty of these are e-commerce players. We now have e-commerce measurement in over 20 markets internationally, giving us the largest global footprint for e-commerce measurement and analytics.","Now, let me talk a little bit more about our Emerging Markets growth plan and China is a key component. As we've said before, China is approximately $200 million in revenue and a critical piece of our emerging market story. We now have a new management team firmly in place and they're focused on a few things: first, expanding our e-commerce measurement and analytics solutions with relationships with JD.com, Tencent, and we've most recently signed a new deal with Suning, the third largest FMCG online retailer in China.","Second, enhancing and expanding our core retail measurement to include now over 6 million retail stores which will measure the consumption of 1.3 billion Chinese consumers. This significant coverage enhancement will be available mid-next year to all of our clients. Finally, we are rebuilding and strengthening our commercial teams across China, and the China growth plan remains an important priority for us, and I look forward to updating you on this and our progress moving forward.","With that, let me close on this point. We are the undisputed leader in international markets. With these initiatives under way, we have the confidence that we'll sustain and strengthen our leadership position over the long term.","With that, let me turn it over to John.","Giovanni Tavolieri - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 19, as you know, there are a number of external pressures in the U.S. Buy business, and what I'm going to talk about this morning is what we're doing about it. First, the Connected System. Over the last few years, we've engaged with clients who've provided critical feedback and really strengthened our development efforts. We are happy to report that we continue to grow the number of clients using at least one component of this system.","We're up to 272 clients compared to 232 as of last quarter. This includes clients who are using applications through our Connected Partner Program, which also continues to grow. One large client recently became the first client to switch to the Connected System as their system of record and are now moving more rapidly from data to insights, which will provide increased value to this important client.","Second, retailer initiatives. In addition to the direct growth we are seeing across our retailer analytics solution such as pricing, assortment, and path to purchase, we've made extraordinary progress with our Walmart and Sam Club's supplier collaboration programs. We signed up more than 750 manufacturing clients, 500 of these are new first-time-ever clients to Nielsen, many of which are small and mid-tier.","In addition, I'm extremely proud to share that we've also been selected as the sole provider of digital content enrichment for Walmart's Food and Beverage business in the United States. I spent the early part of this week in Bentonville, and there's a definite buzz on the ground, both at the Nielsen office and in the engagement we're seeing with Walmart.","Thirdly, we remain focused on the Total Consumer, ensuring relevance of our core measurement services, regardless of where they shop. Most notably this quarter, I'm very pleased that we've expanded our e-commerce offering through an exclusive agreement with Rakuten, previously named Slice. We now have the most comprehensive, multisource e-commerce measurement solution for the fast-growing channel in the U.S. marketplace.","On the right side of the page, the strategic priorities for 2019. First, we'll continue to drive progress on the three key growth initiatives I just highlighted, which will help drive penetration and growth with small and mid-tier clients as well. All of these efforts come together as part of our go-forward strategy to help clients drive growth by leveraging data as an enterprise asset. And this is most evident where we are leveraging our 1,100 data scientists working in tandem with our client teams, technologists and engineers to unlock value for our clients across their entire data ecosystem.","Let's move on now to Technology and Operations on slide 20. We continue to make good progress in our efficiency initiatives, and our focus is now on increased net productivity. In Buy automation, we're on track in our work to automate data collection across our Global Markets, driving productivity, speed, quality, and enhanced capabilities for our clients. On the Watch automation front, we're working on the rollout of new metering technology in the United States. We're focused on this multiyear project as we work closely alongside the Media Ratings (sic) [Rating] (00:32:09) Council and our clients to ensure currency quality measurement.","Finally, consolidation of platforms and super hubs. Our three super hubs are all open and fully functional in Poland, Mexico, and Malaysia. They give us scale and speed to market as new capabilities are deployed to multiple countries simultaneously. In addition, we now have converged 34 countries fully onto our Buy data production platform, which, over time, will seamlessly allow these countries to plug into the Connected System.","Looking at our priorities, one, drive increased net productivity through these initiatives. Two, prioritize our investments in terms of sustaining the business, driving productivity, and enabling growth. It's through this lens that we'll balance our investments across the global business. And thirdly, continue to move work more aggressively to the super hubs to drive benefits through scale and agility. We'll see this contribution ramp up over the next several years.","With that, let me turn it back to Jim.","James A. Attwood - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, John. In closing, as you all know, organizations are only as good as their people. We at Nielsen are very fortunate to have the leaders we have sitting in the room here today. So I want to thank Megan, Pat, and John, as well as all of your teams for all of your hard work. Now, back to Sara.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. Thank you, Jim. Carol, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I'll let someone else ask the free cash flow question. So I wanted to ask about Marketing Effectiveness. I know you mentioned, Dave, in the remarks that you're expecting Marketing Effectiveness to be down more in 4Q than 3Q. I just wanted to sort of see if you could reconcile that with \u2013 I think Megan mentioned that a lot of the work for getting data to be compliant is almost done. So just wanted to understand a little bit better about the trajectory of that and why the lower expectation. And over time, I guess \u2013 are the products that were impacted by GDPR impaired indefinitely? Or are they sort of once the compliance issues get reconciled, are these going to return to strong growth like they had been? Thank you.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Sure, Toni. Thank you. Good morning. Why don't I take the first part of that and then let Megan respond to the second part? So let me just give you a little bit of color. And it might be helpful for me to first set the stage. While you were focusing on the fourth quarter, let me just set the stage by making a couple of additional comments on the third quarter. So, again, as I said in the third quarter, just to refresh, ME was down 10% constant currency year-over-year and the weakness was driven largely by changes to the consumer privacy landscape, which included Nielsen Marketing Cloud, a portion of our custom analytics business related to targeting, and also Multi-Touch Attribution. Again, I'll let Megan talk a little bit more about that.","Now, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and this actually influences the comp quite a bit, we saw a benefit to revenue from the sale of historical data sets, and that was the TVBE data. If you go back in some of our earlier commentary, you'd come across this. Now, we decided to exit TVBE as a product category, so we sold data related to it so we're no longer in it. And so, in the absence of this drag, Marketing Effectiveness would actually be up in the fourth quarter of 2018. I think that's an important perspective when you think about this business.","Megan, you can maybe talk a little bit more about some of the fundamentals and the things that sort of you see and the implications of that.","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Dave. And thank you, Toni, for the question. In terms of timing, it's hard to predict, but what we do see is that the volumes are starting to come back in and we're seeing recent renewals in quarter three of multiyear deals, and in addition to that, clients signing up to restart the services, which is a really good indicator of what's to come.","The retooling, as I said before, is well and truly under way, and it's very complex. It means that we have to do deeper integration with our digital partners and we aim to have that fully done by the end of this year. In light of that, some of the capabilities within our Multi-Touch Attribution product and our targeting capabilities are lighting up over time, so that's a very good sign as well. So, look, with the recent renewals and the sign certainly of the businesses coming back to life in Europe, it's a good sign, it's a good indicator for us.","What I will add to this, because it's really important to note, is that this does not affect Digital Ad Ratings. So Digital Ad Ratings is not a targeting platform. It's a measuring platform, of which we aggregate third-party data. So it's really important that you note that Digital Ad Ratings has not been affected by the privacy constraints that have been put on the marketplace.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Megan. That's great.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Carol, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Just wanted to get a sense of U.S. CPG client base. Surely, they've been talking about raising their prices with inflation, so my question just is, is this tension that they've had for a long time as a customer of Nielsen maybe be less stressed for Nielsen recently? Just how do they look as a customer right now?","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","John, do you want to take that?","Giovanni Tavolieri - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, I'll take it. Thanks very much for the question. Look, in general, we do continue to see within the marketplace ZBB, or zero-based budgeting-related pressure, both in terms of investing in ad hoc projects, but also through the important contract renewal process that we go through. We do still see that clients are being diligent with their overall spend. They're increasing their spend in some specific areas. We're seeing a lift in terms of the analytics that they're doing in pricing, which does link to the inflation that we're seeing and some also increased spend in analytics for assortment.","But we see this being a big function of the disruption that's still happening within FMCG. They continue to face the changing consumer landscape with e-commerce and omni-channel. We combined that with the growth in hard discounters, also looking at that placing a squeeze. And for the big multinationals, with private label continuing to grow, I don't think that we're going to see a marketplace that's going to start to become more buoyant. Inflation will give them the near-term benefit, but I do think that clients are going to continue to be careful and thoughtful of their spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Ryan Leonard on for Manav. Just a question on the China e-commerce strategy. When you were talking about some of the partners there, I didn't hear Alibaba, and I know that had been a win a few years back. So, maybe could you just comment on the status of the relationship and just in terms of since that deal was announced in, I think, 2014, how has the e-commerce measurement landscape changed?","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Pat, do you want to take that one?","Patrick Dodd - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Happy to. Thank you for the question. As you said, we started our relationship with Alibaba back in 2014, where we were working together to codevelop some products. We actually launched two products back then, and we were innovating together with Alibaba. Both of those products, while they had a lot of excitement around them, they didn't get as much traction in the marketplace as we had hoped. So, together, both Alibaba and ourselves, we did sunset those. And so, it's fair to say that over the last couple years there, it had some ups and downs as it relates to our joint product development with Alibaba.","But I am happy to report, and I will come back to measurement in just a moment, on November 10, Alibaba and Nielsen will be launching a new capability in the marketplace, because we're keeping that relationship alive, around the new product testing area, where we will be using all of the Tmall online data and combining that with our offline data to help marketers in all verticals understand new product success all across China. And we want to launch that with Alibaba the day before Singles' Day, which is November 11. And that's a big day for China retail. So we're very excited about that.","As it relates to measurement, as I've mentioned earlier, we have a lot of partners in measurement across China. We've been working on those, and today we actually cover 90% of all e-commerce sales in China. And we have a lot of partners where we get their information directly. And in the case of Alibaba, they have yet to give us their data to go into our syndicated product, but we work on consumer source measures and data science techniques to make sure that we include all the Alibaba sales in our overall measurement. And that allows us to cover 90% of the e-commerce market in China today, along with 90% of the offline that we cover today as well.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In your Buy business, you've seen a bit of spreading of CPG weakness to the large multinationals in your Emerging Markets. Can you discuss whether that's starting to stabilize or whether the trajectory in Emerging Markets is still negative?","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Pat, do you want to take that one as well and I can fill in with a few numbers, too, after your five year overview, if it makes sense?","Patrick Dodd - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. Thank you for the question. As John mentioned earlier, a lot of our large global clients are going through ZBB programs, and when they say global, that is going to carry on a little bit to markets outside the U.S. and Europe to hit some of our Emerging Markets as we move forward. And that's really where we're seeing it.","And what we're seeing in Emerging Markets right now, which we talked about in Q2, is measurement remains mission critical for our FMCG clients, particularly on their priority brands and their priority markets. What we have been seeing over this year for some of our larger clients is pulling back on some of their lower-priority brands. You could call them their tertiary brands or some of their non-priority markets where they don't see as much growth short term as they're trying to work through constraints, budgets. And we're seeing that in a few areas of our business.","For shorter cycle revenue, analytics, as John talked about pricing, trade promotion, in-store activation, these are actually doing quite well because we're helping our clients really activate in the market. But there has been some pressure in consumer research and innovation research, and that's facing some headwinds for us right now as our clients are looking for simpler, faster solutions in the ad hoc world. So, Dave, anything else from you?","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","The only thing that I would add \u2013 and, Pat, you may want to add color to this as well. But we saw good growth in Latin America as well as Eastern Europe. We had pressure across Asia. You mentioned earlier China, but you also talked about the go-forward plan there, new team, and the traction you're seeing already from that. And then, of course, Mid East\/Africa. And, again, largely attributable to short-cycle revenue.","Patrick Dodd - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And our portfolio in that part of the world is slightly more tilted towards short-cycle revenue than we would see in the strong growth we're seeing in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We're obviously working on our product portfolio to bring out more measurement and analytics services over there, out to Asia. But that's where the pressure's been felt this quarter in particular, through Asia and Middle East and Africa.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thank you.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hi, Todd. We can't hear you. If you're on mute, could you take it off?","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can you hear me? Hello?","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Oh, now we can. Hi, Todd.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Now we can hear you.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I am so sorry. I can't work my cell phone. Apologies. Can I \u2013 I'll just quickly get back. So can we get back to the Watch segment, if you don't mind? And just I'd love to hear your thoughts on the consolidation that's going on among some of your larger customers. That has moved from a theoretical topic to an actuality. And I won't name them all, but there's a bunch of this stuff going on, both in your national networks and your local stations customers.","Obviously, we're most interested in how that's affecting your commercial relationships with those partners. But any other comments on just your overall working relationships and the work you do for them but especially the commercial aspect of it would be appreciated. Thank you.","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hi, Todd. Nice to hear from you. It's Megan here. We've experienced consolidation of our end market clients for some time, and as you know, we've continued to have long-term multiservice agreements from them, which, as they consolidate, and if they consolidate, we roll forward. And they're held intact. As I said before, where we see impact is if, in that consolidation, they shut down networks, and where we see them shut down networks it's at the very long tail. It's their much smaller networks that they shut down, which has very little impact on our contracts with them.","The renewal of two of our biggest clients in the last 30 days has been a really positive sign for us in terms of the end markets requiring our measurement more. The performance of our TV National (sic) [National TV] (00:47:08) business sitting in the mid-single-digits is testament to the fact that even in a world of consolidation and in a world of fragmentation and difficulty, our clients require our data more than ever. So, an expectation might be that in a declining end market, we would see the decline as well.","But certainly in the National TV business, we see the opposite. We see a need more and more for our date to help them strategize and help them understand what to do next through a consolidation process. So we remain intact through our consolidation, through that process. And we don't expect that we'll see anything different in terms of behavior.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Megan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I've got a two-parter here. I guess it's probably for David. David, can you talk a little more about just the free cash flow and particularly the working capital headwind you're seeing here? If you could put a little more meat on the bone there.","Relatedly, you guys last quarter had outlined an incremental $150 million addition to the cost rationalization program. I think that brings it to $650 million over the next several years. Just wanted to see if we're all on pace there. And then also, last quarter, the comment was made that free cash flow next year should see some recovery, given a lot of the extraneous factors this year. Just wondering if you'd be willing to talk to that as well there. Thanks, everyone.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Sure. Well, why don't I take the cash, introduce the costs, John, and then you can provide some color and some commentary on that one as well. So, as I said, we're obviously disappointed in the update in terms of the cash guidance. But it's the right thing to do, given the finish to the third quarter and then the deeper review, which is just underway relative to cash flow and the cash flow outlook.","When we look at the major elements, including adjusted EBITDA, CapEx, cash restructuring, as I mentioned earlier, they're all reasonably within the range. And here's what I'm \u2013 here I'm talking about the second half of 2008 (sic) [2018] (00:49:33). They're all reasonably within the range of the July guidance. Again, the big exception was working capital. And as we are looking at that, we're going to look at every element of the cash cycle and understand the practices, payment terms. We'll also be looking more strategically at longer-cycle cash items. And that's a key component of the operational review that I mentioned earlier.","With respect to the forward look, we are really just, call it, unpacking and repacking all elements right now. I'm not going to comment on the forward view because, frankly, I'm just not sufficiently informed at this point. And if I made a statement today, it would be really without a basis of fact or sufficient information to provide you with solid judgment. Just to say again and emphasize, it's a matter of critical importance to us and priority.","With respect to cost, we've obviously been very focused on that. There's a lot of my reaction to you, just summary reaction before turning it over to John to fill in on some additional detail to your question. There's a lot of substance in the programs we have. And there's a lot of evidence and a lot of examples of what we're doing and doing well. As John said, what we're working on together and as part of this operational review is to make sure that all of that action translates into measurable net productivity that will support the company going forward.","John, do you want to comment on some of the specifics?","Giovanni Tavolieri - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Dave. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, we're on track with respect to the specific programs that we would have laid out back in November of last year at the Investor Day. You'll recall the three buckets of activity were to automate Buy, automate Watch, and consolidate our platforms and super hubs. And those cost-saving initiatives, which will also improve quality and speed and give us new capabilities to bring new products to market, they're all on track. The deployment of the automation of Buy capabilities across many of Pat's Global Markets are, if not on track, ahead of schedule. The work that we've done to go and work with Megan and her team to deploy the nanometer, that meter is now live within Sweden.","And in currency, we've got test markets set up in the U.S. In the U.S., the savings will accrue later. It's a multiyear program and we need to work very closely with the MRC and our clients to ensure a smooth transition because it is currency-grade ratings. And you heard earlier, the super hubs that we've opened up, we've got over 21 countries of work now coming through the super hubs, our platform consolidation. So I'm very pleased with where we are in terms of the deployment of those productivity initiatives, and big kudos to the operations and technology teams around the world. They've done great work.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Maybe just one last thing. Thanks, John. One last thing back on the cash, just to round out the discussion, is importantly on the accounts receivable sales, I've mentioned in my comments, as I went through the financial review, you'll see in the numbers, assuming everything plays out as we currently expect it to, there'll be a slight increase in the financing of accounts receivable on a year-over-year basis.","But when you look at it on a fourth quarter basis, full-year basis in terms of sources of cash, there'll actually be a slight decline from that source on a year-over-year basis. So we're not going to that well as a way to make up for this. We're really going into the operational elements and really focusing on that and, again, that's our priority.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Oh, thanks. I'd just like to track back on the comment made about pressure on digital client spending coming in Q4. I don't think this has been addressed in the Q&A yet, but could you please speak a bit more to that, why that is taking place and where specifically that is?","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hi, Tim. This is Megan. Thanks for the question. The pressure that we see on digital clients is coming through from the targeting piece. So it's part of Marketing Effectiveness. As digital clients are the main platform \u2013 or digital platforms, I should say, are the main place in which targeting happens and digital clients are offering targeting or have to offer targeting as part of their platform, their use of data is slowing down while they make sure that that data is privacy compliant. So this is related to the privacy issues that we see appearing inside of Marketing Effectiveness.","Our digital clients are still leaning in very heavily on the requirements that we offer around Audience Measurement of Video and Text, but where it's affecting us is the use of data, data like our TV data, to use for targeting. Again, as I said before, while they become compliant themselves, while they get comfortable with the use of that data around the privacy constraints, and while they have to work with their end clients, the end market to make sure that their third-party data is privacy compliant.","Now, know that we've been in this game for a long time, that privacy is at the cornerstone of our business, and so, our confidence in the quality of our data, the privacy that underpins it, the security that we have around it, means that we're very confident in the data that we offer to our digital clients. We feel confident that as they retool and as they restart their capability around targeting is that the use of our data will come back.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","And, Megan, if I could and, Tim, just to piggyback a little bit on that, Megan, and just talk a little bit and make sure that we've got the right set in terms of kind of expectations for the fourth quarter, there is an implied slowdown, obviously, in the Audience Measurement of Video and Text in the fourth quarter. And one of those key components, as you just mentioned, is the headwind that we expect in terms of digital spend on analytics, which will drive some pressures, all of this coming from the privacy phenomena that you mentioned. So just make sure that we level set with you in terms of that expectation.","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Perfect, Dave.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","That's good.","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","That's great.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Nikitas from Baird. Please go ahead.","Nick J. Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, good morning. Nice to see the at least relative improvement in Buy Developed on a sequential basis. Was there any timing in your project-related revenue that kind of materially impacted that? And then I guess looking at Q4, Dave, I think you mentioned that there is some timing in the Q4 2017 quarter, but I guess on an underlying basis, are you guys starting to see some stability in that business line?","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","We saw some, obviously, improvement and we're talking about now Developed Buy, right? So we saw some improvement in the third quarter, as you know. But it declined \u2013 the decline moderated sequentially, but we wouldn't read too much into that. It's really a little \u2013 we think a little early to call. We still expect Developed Markets to be down mid-single digits for the year. And as also mentioned in my prepared remarks, fourth quarter of 2017 was helped by some timing of historical data sales. So, as a result, we've got another one where we've got a tough comp in this business when you look at our guide for the fourth quarter.","John, anything you would add to that?","Giovanni Tavolieri - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, I think the only thing I would add is our teams continue to be focused on the fundamentals, being with our clients day in and day out. We spent some time this week with the folks at P&G. We'll be at Nestl\u00e9 later today. We're working with our clients to help them deal with their biggest issues, and as they get a little bit more bullish in terms of making additional investment, we'll be there to go and help them.","Patrick Dodd - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And I would just say in the markets outside the U.S., I use the word stable for Q3. I think that's going to be a pretty good word to use for Q4 as well as we head into 2019.","David J. Anderson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Carol, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Well, thanks for taking the question. You know, I was wondering, as we start to see the gestation of more privacy-related policies in the U.S., maybe not exactly in line with, say, Europe. I'm curious what your thoughts are in terms of how are you anticipating that those laws might evolve here and how is it impacting your road map for your products here?","Megan Clarken - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Brian. Look, it's hard for us to speculate how those laws were evolve \u2013 will evolve, I should say. What's important for us is the focus on making sure that we're providing the service, we're able to provide the service, we're in the right place at the right time, and that we're responding to our clients' needs in terms of having compliant software that sits directly on their server or integrating much closer to them than what we had before. And as I said before, that work is going ahead and it's coming out now and will continue to move ahead towards the \u2013 as we go into the end of the year. And it's important to note also that this affects the end markets in terms of the marketers while they have to go through a process of making sure that they get consent from the consumers to use that data.","All of those things start to tick the boxes of what's required in terms of privacy and the use of personalized data. So again, it's hard to speculate how this will unfold over time, but what I will say is that the attention is on that space and rightfully so. The marketplace has got to get this right. The work that's going on at the moment to get this right is significant. We're right in the middle of it. We're in a good place. We've got great relationships with our clients. And so, we'll weather the storm and we're certainly working through this at the moment.","Operator","We'll now turn the call back to Sara Gubins for closing remarks.","Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Carol, and thank you all for joining us on today's call.

And thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's fourth quarter financial performance. I am here with our CEO, David Kenny and our CFO, David Anderson.","A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, I'd like to remind all of you that our remarks and responses to your questions today may contain forward-looking statements, including those about Nielsen's outlook and prospects that are based on Nielsen's current expectations.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and a subsequent report filed with the SEC, which are available on our website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.","On today's call, we with also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Feel free to join the queue again, and if time remains, we will call on you. And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, David Kenny.","David Kenny","Thank you, Sara. Good morning, everyone. I am so excited to be here this morning on my first earnings call as CEO and more importantly I'm really excited to be at the helm of Nielsen at this pivotal point in our history. It's been an exciting three months as I've gotten started here and I'm really happy to give you an update.","This morning I want to cover five topics. First I want to spend a minute on what attracted me to Nielsen and why I am so excited to take this job. Secondly, I know you're all thinking about the strategic review and I want to give you a clear update on that. Then I'm going to turn it over to Dave to review the quarter and the year. After that I do want to come back and give you some clarity on our strategic focus and vision and where we're - where we're energized right now and where we're prioritized to make changes. And then finally, I want to turn it back to Dave who's going to talk about 2019 guidance and the operational discipline we're putting in place to deliver that.","Let me start with what brought me to Nielsen. I'm not new to Nielsen. I've known Nielsen a long time as a customer and as a customer and as a player in the media and marketing industry for many decades now, I've known for a long time the strength of Nielsen's franchise and I continue to believe that we had a centrally important role in the media economy and the FMCG economy.","Independent measurement is more important than ever. Our measurement and the analytics out of it will be increasingly helpful as advertisers, advertising agencies and publishers seek to understand and monetize their audiences. I would say this approach is unique in the world today in combining both big datasets and finely tuned in precise panel.","This is really important in the age of privacy. And I would also say that technology is going to make Nielsen more valuable in the future, as we bring machine learning and artificial intelligence to supercharge these efforts to turn data into models and predictions. We're going to be able to help our clients make better decisions and optimize their businesses.","The same time there are a lot of changes in both the media and FMCG world. And as those end markets change so must Nielsen. In the past few weeks, a lot of the work has been making clear decisions so that we can move and change at the velocity that our end markets need us to.","Toward that end we simplify the organization onto two core platforms. We call these Nielsen Global Media and Nielsen Global Connect. There is a lot of similarities to what you might have known as Watch and Buy. But there's an important clarity that helps us simplify the organization, which we\u2019ll cover later.","I do have to be clear that media is much more than watching a glass screen. Nielsen measures what people watch, what they listen to, what they share, how they engage and that will continue to expand as media expands.","Similarly, connect is about a lot more than what people buy. It's how manufacturers connect to retailers and how they both connect to end consumers, before, during and after the purchase.","I would also say it's very important that both of those platforms be called Global. Our media business is already quite global and has tremendous potential around the world. And similarly our connect business has an important differentiator in being the most global of any of the platforms in the FMCG and retail industries today.","The last thing I'd say about platforms is that we've gotten many businesses that we've acquired and built over time. These moves have made it a lot easier to bring them together under one platform which should help us to scale.","With that background, let me talk a minute about Q4 and Dave will go into detail. I'm proud of the Nielsen teams for delivering on the key operational metrics that they set out for in the second half of 2018. We're working very hard to develop strong discipline and increased visibility into the business.","As you know I wasn't here for all a Q4, but I joined a team that was executing well. Dave will talk about our decision to take a non-cash impairment charge of the Buy business. This resulted as a result of the work Dave and I did to take a fresh look at the long term forecast across our businesses and especially for the Buy business and its market environment. This work was already being done as part of the strategic review analysis and is a normal annual assessment at Nielsen,","Given changes in the market conditions of FMCG, given some competitive pricing actions and other factors this did result in lower forecasts and this led to the non-cash charge. I also want to be clear that charge does not impact business operations nor in any way does it diminish my aspirations for the business. We have a clear plan to improve revenue margins and cash flow generation in our Global Connect business.","Going forward, I think you should expect to see greater consistency in our results and in the expectations we set for you at Nielsen. We have a great team in place here and we are very focused on in selling operating discipline and end to end accountability throughout the organization to drive faster revenue growth, a higher velocity of product innovation and higher profitability.","Now let me take a moment to talk about the strategic review which has occupied a fair amount of my time since I came here. This is an ongoing and very accurate process. As previously discussed, the outcomes could include, continuing to operate as a public independent company or a separation of Nielsen\u2019s Global Connect from the global media segment or a sale of the entire company.","And we are very actively evaluating potential opportunities to determine the best path forward. As we do that, I am very focused on maximizing the value for the company and for all of our shareholders. At the same time, we need to improve our execution and our execution will largely be the same regardless of whether we're public or private. And so I have the team largely focused on improving and clarifying our operating strategy.","With that, let me turn it over to my partner and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Anderson to share some detail on the fourth quarter results. Dave?","David Anderson","Thanks, David very much and thanks to all of you for participating in our call this morning. I want to start with slide number 5, entitled today's discussion, go through a few key topics, basically set up the discussion that we'd like to have with you this morning.","First, we're very pleased obviously that we finished 2018 on track with the updated guidance that we provided. It reflects the organization demonstrating strong operating discipline over the last six months. They've been very responsive.","As you can see on the right hand side of the page where we perform in line or ahead on revenue, margin and free cash flow. Let me just add a little bit to David's comments on the non-cash impairment charge that we took in the fourth quarter related to the Buy business.","As he said we perform our annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. This timing corresponds with the development of our formal budget, as well as our business plan. And it also aligned with the timing of the analysis for the strategic review.","So our updated assessment led us to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.4 billion, $3.97 per share and resulted in an updated carrying value for the Buy business of $3.5 billion. Separately we booked $370 million of net income tax benefit, $1.04 per share driven by adjustments from U.S. corporate tax reform and also from intercompany tax restructuring that we completed at year end. There were no significant cash impacts from these tax adjustments. There were discrete items and they better position us going forward.","And finally, I'll cover our 2019 plan. As you would expect, we've taken a grounded bottom up approach that was informed by the strategic review. It included a detailed review of the revenue outlook, as well as the significant productivity and reinvestment that will enable us to deliver on our 2019 guidance. We also believe that 2019 will serve as the foundation for growth and value creation in Media, as well as Connect over the medium and long term.","With that, let's go to slide number 6 and take a little more detailed look at our fourth quarter and our full year results. As you see revenue declined 3.5% for the quarter and 0.7% for the full year both on a constant currency basis. For full year revenue was in line with expectations, net of the benefit from acquisitions, revenue was down 3.8% in the fourth quarter, but we exclude M&A and onetime revenue items in the prior year, fourth quarter revenue declined 0.2% constant currency.","For the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $488 million, down 13.3% constant currency, adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.4%, down 332 basis points constant currency. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $1.85 billion, down 7.9% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.4%.","Margins for both period were impacted obviously by revenue weakness and also investments in our growth initiatives, partly offset by productivity. GAAP net income per share was a loss of $2.68 in the fourth quarter, a loss of $2 for the full year. And again, both periods were impacted Buy impairment charge and the tax benefits that I mentioned.","We also incurred an $8 million expense in the fourth quarter, $9 million for the full year, both of those post-tax associate with the strategic review which also impacted our GAAP net income.","If you exclude those items, net income per share was $0.28 in the quarter, $0.96 for the year. So the operational EPS for 2018 was in line with expectations.","Free cash flow was $397 million in the fourth quarter, $542 million for the year and cash flow exceeded our expectations for the second half of the year. The outperformance was driven mostly by a significant improvement in cash collection. And just to give you some insight on that, DSO improved by four days during the fourth quarter versus the same period last year and resulted in one full day for the full year.","Let's now spend a few minutes on each of the businesses, going first to Watch, which is on slide 7. You can see our fourth quarter results were consistent with what we referenced at the end of the third quarter.","Revenue for the segment for the fourth quarter was $881 million, down 2.8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. If we adjust for M&A and other items, Watch revenue would have been up 1% year-over-year.","Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 1.6% constant currency and as expected guide - and we guided growth slowed in the fourth quarter due to pressure on digital client spend, on products related to targeting, given changes in the privacy landscape. We also saw slower growth at Gracenote.","Importantly, we continue to see strength in national TV which grew mid single digits for the year. Audio was down 1.5% in the quarter, down 0.6% for the year, largely in line with expectations.","Marketing effectiveness was down 22.3% constant currency, as we're still being impacted by some privacy related changes, as well as a tough comparison from historical data sale in the fourth quarter of last year. If we adjusted for that data sale, marketing effectiveness would actually have been up approximately 11%.","Now Watch adjusted EBITDA was $390 million, down 5.6% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 44.3%, down 131 basis points constant currency. The decline was mostly again driven by a difficult comp related to last year's historical data sale, I referenced that earlier. It impacted segment margins by approximately 190 basis points, stated another way, if we excluded that margins would have actually been up approximately 60 basis points.","Let's turn now to slide number 8. Just a quick summary on the Buy segment, we expected and we saw continued softness in developed markets, while emerging markets showed some improvement, again, in line with expectations.","Fourth quarter the Buy revenue was $770 million, down 4.4% constant currency. The impact from M&A was negligible in the quarter. Revenue in developed markets was $482 million, down 7.1% constant currency, reflecting weakness from global multinationals and then obviously competitive impacts in the U.S. Importantly retailer initiatives are performing well and we expect this to be a tailwind in 2019.","Revenue in emerging markets for Buy was $289 million or up 4.4% constant currency. We saw faster growth in short cycle revenue, strong growth from local clients offset in part by continued pressure from multinationals. And as an update, China revenue declines lessened in the fourth quarter and we expect continued improvement for that important market during 2019.","Buy adjusted EBITDA was $108 million, down 32% constant currency, adjusted EBITDA margins were 13.9%. And key contributors to the decline and include revenue softness, product mix, as well as investments that we've made in retailer programs and other initiatives.","So with that quick summary of the finish for 2018, let me turn it back to David for some of his comments and perspectives.","David Kenny","Thank you, Dave. And what I want to comment is where we go next. Clearly I didn't come to Nielsen to keep operating it the way it's operating. We need a big inflection. We can and must perform better. And I'm focused on that transformation to a high performance company. We - the company deserves it, our clients deserve it, and we can do it.","To do that, the most important thing we can do is to increase our velocity so that the company is better serving changing client needs in both the Media and FMCG space. How do we do that? We need to make faster, bolder decisions, we need to execute those decisions and we need to transform Nielsen into a truly product-driven measurement and technology organization.","Here's how I'm going to do that. Number one, we're going to have really clear product roadmap that prioritize scalable products. Number two, all those products are going to align on single cloud-based architectures for the Connect segment and the Global Media segment. And we're going to take the tough and important decision of retiring many legacy systems because those systems slow us down. They drive inefficiency and quite honestly by having an architecture we can do much faster, more efficiently and drive bigger revenue opportunities.","Thirdly, those products are going to become modern by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. We do a very good job of measuring the path. With these new technologies we're going to do a much better job of predicting the future as well. And that asset, our data is going to continue to improve both measurement and predictive models and our clients are going to continue to rely on Nielsen and in fact rely on Nielsen more to drive better decisions that improve their businesses.","That doesn't happen without talent. I've got an obsessive focus on making sure we've got the best talent and we're focusing the best talent on the best projects. I want to be clear, I've been very impressed my first 90 days by the tremendous amount of talent already in-house at Nielsen.","We've got world-class data science and data integration capabilities. We've got great product leaders who understand the market. We've got great commercial leaders who understand their clients. There's a lot to work with here. That said it needs to perform better. And I'm holding myself and my management team accountable for performance and we will continue to make the changes to have a high performance team at every level of the organization and that will include adding some key talent from the outside. We\u2019ve added a couple of great people already and we're going to continue to work hard to make sure we have the talent focused on the best products and deliver everything Neilson is capable of.","Lastly that talent needs to be well organized. So we're doing a - I think a simpler job of aligning our technology and operations into the two business segments that we've got end to end accountability for delivering these platforms and the products that run on them.","All of that's been done to make sure we're organized around driving speed and scale. And I have to say, I'm pleased so far with our momentum and our ability to move quickly and get focused on the task ahead.","Let me now break them into the two part, Media and Connect. In the Nielsen\u2019s Global Media platform, we have a lot of strengths and I was over using that to build one end to end platform that brings together all those strengths and assets, across discovery, measurement, planning, activation and optimization with several discrete businesses that are coming together and we're delivering that in over 60 markets around the world.","As I said earlier, this is a global opportunity and I believe our growth comes from more services to the existing clients, new media clients, growing as our media clients grow and expanding globally. We've got a lot of places that we can grow that Global Media segment.","I would say we've already demonstrated that we have the ability to respond as the market evolves. The launch Total Audience Measurement platforms, including digital ad ratings and digital content ratings, subscription video on demand, out-of-home, streaming media and many more, Nielsen has done a good job of keeping up as the media evolves.","That said, we're going to focus this much more and we're focusing on three key points. Number one, we must continue to invest in expanding our digital platform. We know this is where the media market is heading. We know we've got a leadership position and we need to continue to invest to extend that lead.","Secondly, we're focused on becoming even more embedded with our media clients. We have a broad and longstanding client relationship across the media ecosystems, but we also know they're changing, they're automating, they're making more data driven decisions and we're working with them to embed Nielsen into the way our publishers, advertisers and agencies work.","And thirdly, we're going to continue to focus on product advancements that expand Nielsen currency position. This is a strong leadership position that the industry relies on and we can expand currency to underpin custom metrics above it such as NBC CFlight [ph] in a way that helps our clients differentiate and extends the currency position.","This was under way in 2018. In 2018 there were important things done. The Media platform launched qualified ad audience solutions for digital ad ratings, which enables some really important solutions around viewerability and fraud, key issues in that segment.","Secondly we launched total ad ratings for mobile, which was really important for a number of customers, including YouTube and we made big progress in driving adoption of digital content ratings.","Nielsen continues to adapt to emerging industry trends in media. Very recently, you saw us acquire Sorenson Media, which I approved because combining that with Gracenote automatic content recognition technology means that Nielsen had far and away the best IP portfolio in the world and the best tech platform in the world to make addressable TV a reality. This is a challenge that has haunted the media industry for some time and Nielsen's finally put all the pieces together in one company to make it happen.","The other thing I'd say that affected media and certainly affected Nielsen is the changes in privacy. Clearly 2018 saw a number of changes in the privacy landscape, which honestly we support. We think they're important for society and we applaud the efforts.","As I said, velocity is important to respond to those because I don't think we're done. I think there will continue to be changes to the privacy landscape and we could have answers for that.","Nielsen uniquely has a key differentiating factor in its panel. The ability to use panels to translate big data into something that reflects the total population is unique at Nielsen. The panels are very privacy friendly. We certainly protect our panelists at all costs which is why they share more with us. And this is going to enable us to continue to differentiate and solve an important issue in the media landscape.","Let me sum up on the Media side. You can hear my enthusiasm. We've got a lot of opportunity. Nielsen has been unrivaled, solid leader and we have been and should continue to be the one media truth across the entire media value chain. Media is getting more complicated and Nielsen's going to make it more simple to be able to operate in that complexity.","Let me turn to the other platform, Connect. Clearly, FMCG and retail clients have big changes in front of them. And they're looking for Nielsen to help understand what consumers buy, how they got a better shopping experience before they buy, what is their path to purchase, and how does that all work more seamlessly across retailers, manufacturers and consumers.","Nielsen's unique in the solution for that. We're the only global player in the FMCG space, operating in more than 100 markets. And I would also say we're working quickly to deal with some dynamic changes, whether those be cost pressures on manufacturers who need data to make smarter decisions, whether those are retailers who need better insights as data becomes key to keeping up with changing consumer preferences. And then, I would also say, we have competitors that we need to stay ahead of, especially in markets like the United States.","So, with both those opportunities in leadership and the challenges, we've been focused on strengthening the position and operating leverage of our Connect business. Over the last couple of years, Nielsen has made significant progress. And while you might have seen in the past called the Connected System, now a product called Nielsen Connect, which, over time, will serve as the single architecture for our entire FMCG and retail business.","I like Nielsen Connect a lot. As a guy who comes from the technology side, it's an impressive, first-of-a-kind platform. It's an open system which has enabled Nielsen to work more easily with our clients' architectures because all of our clients are improving their backbones as well. It enables us to embed more clearly into the client workflows. It enables us and our clients to connect Nielsen with other third-party vendors. And as a single cloud-based platform, we can drive now much higher velocity of innovation.","I would say measurement is the backbone in Nielsen Connect, but this foundation will allow us to do a lot more with predictive analytics and activation, which adds more value to our clients and more growth for the Connect platform.","We're going to continue to add capabilities now to expand our market opportunity, such as the supplier collaboration program we've launched with Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, which have been very good for Wal-Mart and Sam's, but also very good for Nielsen. As an example, that platform in 2018 signed up 850 clients and more than 70% of those clients were new manufacturers for Nielsen.","Many of those new clients are small and mid-tier size clients, who can easily take advantage of the platform, and this sized client has not historically been a client base that Nielsen served well. But now that we have technology, we can use retailer program to connect all of those companies, big and small, with Nielsen Connect.","At the same time, the backbone in the measurement is coverage, and we continue to invest in coverage across all the channels that matter to our clients. This includes a big focus on e-commerce measurements, where we're now in 30 markets that comprise over 90% of global FMCG sales. Clearly, a very strong and important platform at Nielsen Connect.","Let me then summarize what that means for 2019. And Dave's going to go through the details of the 2019 guidance. As you hear that guidance, you should hear three key, clear focal points, which I've already talked about.","Number one, we're going to be obsessive about our products and the revenue growth that those products generate for our shareholders. And, more importantly, the value those products create for our clients.","At the core, we're a measurement company. We're going to continue to strengthen our measurement products. In media, we are -- Nielsen is -- the single source of truth throughout the entire media ecosystem. This media measurement business is stable. It's recurring and it's highly visible. More importantly, it is the backbone on how the media industry works.","In Connect, our core measurement will help retailers and manufacturers understand what is driving market share. Again, this is a very important critical way that the FMCG and retail industry works. And we're deeply embedded in those companies as an independent source of truth.","Now, above measurements, we have analytics and predictive models. This is where a lot of future growth should come from. Analytics have always been a focus of Nielsen, but, unfortunately, what I found here was a series of point solutions as opposed to an analytic platform. That's a lot of what we're changing.","We need to change that for leverage, but we also need to change that, so there is -- with that move to the cloud, we can take more advantage of AI and ML to make all of those solutions more predictive and more valuable to existing and new clients.","And clients need this to be able to compete as technology evolves. So, we've got a really important combination of measurement and analytics to talk about here.","And I would say what you're going to see is where we are today. A lot of the transition in 2019 is simplifying, consolidating and strengthening that analytic and predictive model platform, while we continue to strengthen core measurements. And we're going to share our numbers with you in those segment on both sides.","Secondly, we are very focused, as I said, at aligning all of this around a cloud-based platform for Media and a cloud-based platform for Connect; and where valuable, those two can talk to each other. This is essential for scaling our solutions.","Getting a modern platform right is key. And having a single architecture is the only way to do that. And that means we continue to see clients taking on components of the platform today and we're on a path to be able to move all of them to the new platform and retire legacy platforms. This is something I've done before in prior companies. We've got the people here to do it and it's essential to get this right.","Finally, we've put a number of initiatives in place to improve our operational discipline. We have a recurring business with a fair amount of visibility that gives us a lot of opportunity to be disciplined, predictable and to continue to deliver on our commitments. Our 2019 plans commit to this operational excellence, which lays the foundation for operating in a way that executes on this vision in the years ahead.","I'm very excited that we know what we need to do and we're laying the foundation. That foundation is going to provide revenue growth, profitability and increased shareholder value over time. Nielsen can, and it will, and it must, do better. And I have confidence early on here that we're taking the right actions quickly to position your company for success.","Now, let me turn it back to Dave who can help you translate them into numbers with the 2019 guidance. Dave?","David Anderson","Thanks, David, very much. So, I wanted to start with a focus on 2019 by going to slide number 12. As David mentioned, we're now organized into two segments, Media and Connect. We're also making changes to the categories within these segments, as you can see here on the top half of the slide.","Our segment categories are based around our core measurement platforms in both Media and Connect, with plan, optimize and predict and activate designed to build on measurement and enhanced client decision-making.","The moves better align our external view to our go-forward internal review, which is going to enable us to drive greater accountability throughout the organization, and they're also very consistent with what David emphasized in terms of our product-driven focus.","Now, we've laid out these changes for you in the appendix of today's earnings slides. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, we're also now incorporating organic constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EPS into our reporting framework to give you more clarity into the normalized revenue and earnings power of the organization. The definitions for adjusted EPS are consistent with the approach to adjusted EBITDA.","Now, the enhancements are consistent with the goal of greater transparency and improved communications. We spoke about that in the third quarter earnings release. And we've since subsequently spoken to many of you regarding these financial metrics. We appreciate your inputs.","In our press release, we provided the recast historical figures to the new segments, including organic revenue constant currency growth and also adjusted EPS. Importantly, the definition of organic revenue includes the net effect of business acquisitions and divestitures over the last 12 months. It doesn't adjust for any one-time items.","Finally, although we will no longer break out developed versus emerging markets in the Connect segment, we'll obviously provide you with additional color on growth by region going forward.","So, let's now go to more specifics on 2019, starting on slide 13. On a total company basis, we expect total constant currency revenue growth to be approximately flat to up 1.5%, represents an improved, obviously, trajectory over the 2018 results.","It includes roughly 40 basis points of net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures completed in the last 12 months, but we also had some onetime revenue items in 2018 that do not recur in 2019, which create roughly 80 basis points of revenue headwind for us in 2019.","We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 28% to 29%, roughly flat year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA margin will be driven by significant productivity, partly offset by reinvestment in the business. I'm going to walk you through some of those drivers in a few moments.","Adjusted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.77. This reflects higher depreciation and amortization compared to 2018, as well as higher interest expense.","And lastly, free cash flow, we expect to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. At the midpoint, roughly flat with 2018. Now, the drivers include lower incentive compensation payouts and also lower retailer payments, offset in part by higher cash interests and also cash taxes.","We expect CapEx to be up slightly in 2019, driven primarily by increased investments in Media, which includes the investment in Total Audience Measurement, digital as well as Gracenote. The distribution of CapEx spend and resource allocation will be directed at our greatest growth opportunities, with discipline around ROI.","And as I mentioned earlier, we've taken a bottom-up approach to 2019. We've spent considerable time unpacking and repacking numbers to provide us with a solid understanding of the full-year outlook. And important for you to know, that guidance at roughly the midpoint of our 2019 operating plan.","We've provided commentary on additional inputs to our key 2019 metrics in the appendix of our slides.","So, let's go now to slide 14 and go quickly through the segments. For Global Media, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be approximately 2% to 3%. We expect acquisitions completed in the last 12 months to add about $35 million in revenue.","Additionally, as part of our product category exit in 4Q 2017, we provided transitional services for one year following that product category exit. The loss in servicing revenue in 2019 will result in about a $30 million drag on revenue. So, roughly, equal to the add that we're looking to from acquisition.","We expect Audience Measurement within Media to grow 2% to 3% in 2019 compared to 3.8% in 2018. So, continued strength in the national TV measurement, which we expect to be up mid-single-digits as well as strength in digital. The main driver of the slower growth is local, which we expect to be down mid-single digits.","And I'd also note that audience measurement category also now includes audio, which has a relatively flat growth outlook. And that, obviously, influences the comp, the year-over-year comp.","We expect plan and optimize to grow 1% to 2% in 2019, with the anticipation of continued privacy headwind.","In the Connect segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be down 2% to flat. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures completed in the last year is about a 20 basis point drag due to a small divestiture that we've completed.","Now, we expect constant currency revenue in measure to be down 1% to up 1% within Connect, reflecting expectations for an increasing growth rate internationally as well as reduced declines in the U.S.","We expect predict and activate to be down 2% to 4%, reflecting continuing, but lessening, pressure in innovation and consumer insights practices, as well as growth in every day analytics.","Now, to help reconcile with our current reporting structure, our guidance assumes improvement in both developed and emerging trajectories for Connect, with developed buy revenue down 2% to 3% and emerging up mid-single digits.","Let's turn now to slide 15 to take you through some of the expectations around margins. We expect to drive significant productivity across the organization, partly offset by strategic reinvestments. You can see that picture here on the slide.","The productivity is based partly on carryover from actions we began in 2018. These are mostly operational initiatives. And we've got additional actions that are either under way or planned, for which we have clear line of sight for 2019.","The productivity will be offset by two primary factors. First, we're going to have higher expense for annual incentive pay. As you would expect, incentive compensation was significantly reduced in 2018. Our goal is to make the numbers in 2019 and to recognize and reward the organization, so the guide includes this accrual.","Second, we're making strategic investments to drive future growth. The majority of the reinvestment will be in Media, including investments in digital, addressable advertising, as well as local. And as a result of these factors, the midpoint of our guidance suggests margins roughly flat compared to 2018.","Let's go to slide 16. I'll talk just a little bit about what we anticipate in terms of phasing for the 2019 outlook. We think this is very important additional color for you. Overall, we expect the second half of 2019 to be stronger than the first half.","For revenue, we had some one-time items in the first half of 2018 that make for a more difficult comparison to the first half of 2019. And importantly, we expect the first quarter revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin should be correlated with the revenue pattern that I just mentioned. We'll also see the benefit of productivity initiatives that will be phased through quarters two through four.","So, in other words, we'll see greater lift and benefit in those periods. The first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be below the prior year, but we expect to see margin uptick in the second quarter.","Quarterly free cash flow should be consistent with historic patterns, which are heavily second-half weighted. The first quarter 2019 free cash flow should show an improvement versus our first quarter in 2018, driven by lower retailer payments and also from lower cash incentive payouts this year compared to last year.","So, in summary, we're confident in our plan. As you heard in David's comments, we had a strong commitment to deliver on all fronts. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.","And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Sara for Q&A.","Sara Gubins","Thank you, Dave. So, we're ready to open the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Good morning. Hi, David and Dave. My question is, do you think this high level of reinvestment the company needs now could be achieved in this year 2019? Or might this kind of full reinvestment of the productivity gains extend beyond one year?","David Kenny","Listen, I think at this point, it's not good to call an end to it. I think we're going to continue to invest to build really strong products. I do believe those should drive scalability, so the new products should have higher margin.","But I would say, at this point, I want the flexibility to really build some longer-term plans before I would be committing to sort of a change in long-term model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Great, thanks. Nice to hear your voice again, David, after many years under different guises. My question really is about the - all the commentary you're making about the changes that you guys need to do since you've come in, prior management team made a pretty good presentation, I thought, about the changes to connected system. And I think you seem to be continuing that in some sense.","But, I guess. I wonder - I understand its an open architecture and so forth, but this sounds like a big change maybe with a lot of CapEx needs. I guess, what do we need to know in terms of what you're doing to really improve the connected system effort. I'm focusing on more on what used to be called the Buy side. But what -- can you give us a bit more on kind of what needs to be done to improve this business?","David Kenny","Yeah. And I do want to correct that I don't think it's a big capital investment because, part of what we're doing here -- first of all, I have to say, it was a good plan in place, and so, we don't have to start over.","What I think we need more clarity in the organization is that we create one system, that we're more aggressive in retiring the old system. So, that frees up productivity. And quite honestly, that retires old capital.","Secondly, it is a cloud-based system. It will run on public cloud. Microsoft has been a really good partner on that. And so, I think that changes the capital dynamics from things that would have historically been dealt in our own data centers.","Thirdly, I think that it's been important that we define the architecture more clearly, so that you do things horizontally. So, there are different functions across the connected system. You don't need to do that more than once. And so, having this sort of top-down architecture across the system would be helpful.","Lastly, I think some of the concept was more of a big bang in the past that somehow we could launch this brand-new system and then we would go sell it. In reality, I think we've done a much better job of componentizing it, so that clients can move to it over time.","We've got hundreds of clients already using components of the connected system. They're moving in the right direction. And I think this migration of continued value and improvement is the way you do this in a more effective way.","And without a big bang investment up front with some big bang change at the back end. It's more of a continued improvement in the way it operates and then it's growth and margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. You talked a lot about the individual segments, I guess, and why you find them attractive. I was wondering, your initial thoughts, if you could give us some of the marriage you see of having both of them together under one company?","David Anderson","Sure, Manav. And I'm going to be clear that I think it's an option. There are -- what's important is that each of these businesses is optimized for its segment. And the segments are quite different and the needs are quite different. So, that is important.","That said, there is synergy in having them together as they both get stronger because you can, of course, take everything you're doing on the connected system to understand the best way to market, the data from the Media business can help improve that, and that can then feed into the models in the Media business that helps us connect segments.","I should be clear, though, that the FMCG and retail world is only 10% to 12% of advertising. So, it's for that segment. But I would say the Media business is equally looking at connecting to data from the auto segment, from the financial services segment, from hard goods, all the other folks who advertise. And the Media business will cover the whole consumer economy, not just the part covered by our own FMCG business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Stanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can I focus my one question please on the guidance in the Audience Measurement? David, thank you for your help in sort of componentizing that into the various line items. Of course, I'm going to pick on the one that stuck out as most negative, at least to me, which is the local markets business, which, I think, you talked about being down mid-singles.","Can you explain a little bit more to us the dynamics around that? Is there any timing issues with particular customers? Is it a competitive issue? Is it political in 2018 and comping that?","There's a bunch of stuff that could be. But would love to understand that a little more and then think about how we should think about a normalized growth rate for that over time? Thanks.","David Kenny","Thank you, Todd. So, listen, the end market of local is certainly seeing the changes as things go to digital, as things move to streaming. Local broadcast had some headwinds. And so, we're not going to outgrow our client. I think we're working with them as they deal with this, number one.","I'd say, secondly, we have made a number of important investments on the local business. Retiring paper diaries happened this year. We did get to direct measurement of people versus households. We have measured out-of-home measurements on local, which has been important. We've also been focused on skinny bundles, virtual NPVs and advanced audience segment. So, we're helping the local market in many places.","I would say there were some delays in some of the markets in what we were counting on in terms of a new platform. So, that has been finished now, but that did affect us a bit in 2018.","And some of that's us and some of that is industry acceptance of these changes. Took a little more time than we might have anticipated because there is a complexity to rolling out a change. So, I think we're on a good path to fixing the issues.","When you bring up competition, and there's some noise from another measurement company at the tail end of local. So, to be clear, local is not equal across the market. There are big urban areas where you need what Nielsen does. You need to have the panel.","You need to be able to scale up. Some of the smaller markets have, because of their economics, settled for a lower degree of rigor in their analytics. So, just going to measure straight households. It doesn't serve everything that the Nielsen currency does, but they're selling to local advertisers a different standard.","We're not competing at that standard. We are competing for the Nielsen currency. We're delivering the Nielsen currency increasing efficiently. But I think there is a long tail that we're just going to make a decision as to whether we focus on it or not and how to do it in the right way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Salmon","All right. Good morning, everyone. David, I think I've got a high-level one for you that hopefully helps sort of flesh out your vision a little bit more. I think, traditionally, the concept -- you keep referring, of course, to the concept of the currency and media.","And I think, traditionally, that was a relatively straightforward concept and it basically boiled down to the GRP. But as you see in the market, obviously, you're seeing marketers move much more toward business outcomes.","So, here is my high-level question, is can you lay out for us what is in your view a currency in the modern-day advertising economy where business outcomes are more important?","And then, as dovetail to that, you mentioned a little bit more about the synergy between the two businesses. If business outcomes are more important, it would seem that that does imply that it would be good to have the two segments working more closely together?","But as you noted, the segment formerly known as Buy is more focused on FMCG and retail. So, presumably, that would mean that business outcomes requires more partnerships in other sectors. So, just high-level, I'd be interested to hear your color on that? Thank you.","David Kenny","Thank you, Dan. Another good question. So, first of all, on currency, there is, I think, a really important need to understand who watches and how long they watch, any media. There is a foundational element that is essential for the investment. And we measure that uniquely. And the way we do it and the investment we put into it means that we uniquely measure everyone.","And that's really important, I think, for Media which serves all of society to measure everyone. Part of the reason that we go to age and gender is that those are two metrics that every person has and, therefore, we can make sure we're measuring every person. That foundation is key to understanding the base level.","Above that, you're absolutely right. So, that puts a base value. Above that, then you create differential investment connected to business outcomes and to attribution. We do a lot of things in that.","The investment, a couple of years ago, in Visual IQ is helping with multi-touch attribution. A lot of our modeling is helping with that, so that you can get to those outcomes.","But it's important to get to those outcomes in a sophisticated way that looks at all the things that led to the funnel of a purchase versus just attributing the last click. So, all of those analytics have been important. And, quite honestly, those analytics only work if you start with a base measurement of everybody. So. This is why, I think, it's important.","And there is a reason why a lot of the digital platforms, particularly in the video segment, are now Nielsen measured. I would tell you that, since I've gotten here, a lot of the inbound calls have been my old friends on the West Coast.","And some of the big digital platforms elsewhere in the world who want to figure out how to be Nielsen measured because having that foundation, having that common currency across all of this is essential. And then, you do the outcomes-based work above it. And we, clearly, need to play in both segments which is why we're doing it that way.","Secondly, you're absolutely right that the design of this cloud-based platform on the Media side is also designed to be open, so there will be more partnerships. You may have seen a good partnership last week between connect and NPV, so that we could look at the whole store.","We could do the FMCG side; they can do the hard goods side of stores. And that's' certainly helping retailers. That's also helping provide data that helps those companies with their media investments across the entire store.","And I think we've got a good one with the J.D. Power around auto. There are several under way. But, yeah, I think the company needs to be more open, easier to work with, so that we can bring our data together with other data and serve the entire consumer economy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Meuler","Yeah, thank you. So, maybe a different take on an earlier question. But as you look to drive a big inflection in the business and you've taken a fresh look at the different businesses and opportunities, there's not really a margin reset in 2019 guidance, there's not really a CapEx reset.","So, as you talk about, I guess, funding analytics platforms and addressable TV and more global, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, are the productivity opportunities in the business such that you can continue to fund all of these opportunities and raise the growth profile of the company around the current margin profile?","And similarly, from a both OpEx and CapEx perspective, the back-end tech platform that you're inheriting, is it sufficient to kind of enable the modern client-facing platforms that you foresee for the company? Thank you.","David Anderson","Maybe I could just, Jeff, start with that. And, David, you can add to that. I think, first of all, the productivity that we've identified and included in the 2019 plan, I had stated this earlier, but a portion of that is carryover from very solid programs that were initiated in 2018. And a portion of that is new where we've got clear line-of-sight plans under way. So, we've got confidence in what we need to do and what we need to deliver for 2019.","Frankly, there is a lot more that we will continue to drive and will continue to influence in terms of overall productivity in the company. But the best productivity is going to come as a result of improving our top line. And the revenue growth and the reinvestment that David talked about and the strategic focus that he mentioned is really, obviously, critical to that.","Regarding the tech stack and the replatforming, that's a critical priority for us. That is really on top of what we've identified to date. We're looking through that now in terms of what the reinvestment requirement is. We think we can transition that successfully through the architecture.","One reference architecture, one for Buy or Connect, one for Media. In the course of the next 12, 18, 24 months, we think we can successfully transition that. That's also going to be very important to us in terms of both the product delivery and competitiveness, marketplace competitiveness of our products, but also in terms of our cost structure. So, all of that is included in our thinking, in our planning.","David Kenny","Jeff, you've gotten to the heart and the core issue. To give you a sense, my first day at Nielsen, I started it in Oldsmar to start with a platform review. And my office is not in Connecticut. It's in New York, in the tech center at a desk in the middle of the engineers.","I want to keep my finger on this. It's the issue that will hold us back if we don't get it right. I do say that it was the right thinking, that it was the right architecture on Connect and, quite honestly, the right architecture on Media. And both of those, we're working well with public cloud companies because that's how you solve it. You move it more to rented infrastructure and you modernize.","But I think what is missing a bit is the top-down detailed understanding of what needs to be done and just the ruthless pulling out the weeds of all the old system. These economics will only work if we retire old systems.","That takes some courage. That takes a little bit client handholding. That's what we're in the middle of doing right now, is getting everybody on to this. This is an execution issue. It's not a strategy question in my mind.","And I do believe we've improved the exclusion already, but we've got a ways to go, and that's what we're going to focus. But I'm committing to it because that's the way we deliver this profile, is we modernize the platform by retiring old and moving to new. And we're going to go as fast as we can over the next year to make that happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one quickly on the formerly known as Watch segment and one on formerly known as Buy segment. On the Watch side, maybe you could talk a little bit about the TAM framework and how you're thinking about cross-platform evolving this year and into 2020? Do we start to see any material economics from cross-platform here in 2020?","And related to that, when do we start to see more of the set-top box there? I know you have some RTB data, some of the bigger data sets start to get incorporated into the syndicated Watch management. Any color there would be helpful. And then, I'll stop there and I\u2019ll bag question. Thanks, guys.","David Kenny","Well, thank you, Matt. Shouldn't somebody else have a Buy\/Connect question after you? Listen, on the TAM framework, that is the framework under which [indiscernible]","Total Audience, it's the way that all of this is working. And I think we're already seeing it. I would say, in the several renewals that were done last year, more services were being used and folks were committing to that. I think it's been a key differentiator in the discussions I'm having right now with all of our media clients, in that they really want us to measure all of this in a very positive way. So, I think it's \u2013 the moment its there, it's part of our differentiation.","And as I mentioned before, we've got many new media companies coming to Nielsen for the first time, not only in the United States, but in 50 countries around the world, all of whom say, listen, in the future, we're going to distribute in all these ways, we need a common currency to be able to do that.","And, increasingly, we need new tools to be able to market that in the way that NBC is doing with CFlight. So, that's certainly I think -- we're seeing it already. We should see it ramp up as digital improves.","I would say, secondly, on the set-top box data, we made an investment there for local, but we found that it's useful well beyond local to enhance our knowledge of what's going on in the [indiscernible]. So, that's continuing to happen in big ways.","Beyond set-top box data, I would say, one of the other important moves, as we called it, media is the integration of the Gracenote platform. Everything we're doing with ACR is another source of metadata, and that's helping us understand consumers in another way. And as we get to that bridge between date measurement and analytics, that platform will be key.","And then, Gracenote, of course, combining with Sorensen, as I said before, creates the IP portfolio for addressable, which is data at a very specific individual level, which I think is really going to help our media customers as well.","So, I think we've got the pieces to work with our media clients as they go through, I think, at pretty accelerated pace of getting to new ways to monetize those content here. And that data is just going to continue to make all of us stronger.","Finally, I would say, machine learning is going to bring that data into predictive models for the future as well.","David Anderson","Maybe just quickly, to tag on, just as a reminder, national guidance up mid-single digits. The guide to digital is low double digits in 2019. So, that's reflected also in our numbers.","David Kenny","And most of those national customers are also using the digital products.","David Anderson","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. David, you discussed a number of initiatives that drive improvement across Global Media and Global Connect. I guess, where are your priorities among the initiatives you talked about? And what internal metrics will you watch most closely to measure your success?","David Kenny","Yeah. So, listen, as I said, they are in three areas. First of all, on metrics. Let me start with the fact that what I really want is consistency and results. I want no surprises on these calls. I want to be really clear what we're going to do and I want to hit it. And I'm being very clear with people, there is no tolerance for inconsistency. We have to be a predictable performance company.","In order to do that, what you should know about this guidance in the 2019 plan is that we worked very hard, 24\/7 practically, from the minute I got here, to build it all from the ground up, to make sure we understand each and every initiatives.","And there's clear requirements to deliver on those results. And while we are changing little things, we also have a large organization, and so we've been able to allocate each of these to clear people I can hold accountable, to make sure that we deliver it. So, I start with that framework.","When I get to the KPIs above that, I would say -- as I said, there is three areas. The number one is I'm really focused on customer value. I'm trying split my time half internal and half to clients because we really need to help our end markets deal with the changes that are happening there.","So, the product has to be solid. They have to have high usage. They have to have high satisfaction. And I'll measure that in terms of renewal rates, in terms of price escalators, in terms of engagement scores, in terms of use of the product, in terms of market share. So, very product, customer-driven KPI is where we begin.","Secondly, I need to measure scalability. So, it's not just productivity. We need to know that the incremental product innovation come at higher margin. That happens when we use a common platform and a single architecture because the next things are easy to build on top of it. At the same time, that also enables higher product velocity, which should help the first thing on customer value.","And thirdly, you have to hold us accountable for the outcome. So, revenue, free cash flow, ROI are key. And underneath that, I'm really making sure I look at product profitability and the cost footprint to make sure we continue to be nimble and that we don't have excess costs where we don't need it and everything is directed to delivering that product value and scalability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. A quick question on the measure guidance, the expectations for reduced decline in the U.S. I was just wondering how much confidence do you have there? We continue to see negative headlines on FMCG companies. Do you expect any impact from those? Thanks.","David Anderson","So, we have pretty good confidence in those numbers. We both mentioned that the development of this guide, the development of the numbers we're sharing with you has really been done on a bottom-up basis.","So, we've looked client by client, contract renewal by contract renewal. There is a lot of data, obviously, that informs this with that. There also is, over time, consistency in the performance of that particular segment of the business. So, we feel good about that. David, anything you'd want to add to that?","David Kenny","Listen, there is give and take here. There's some real bright spots and upsides in the connect business. I'm very excited about what we're doing with retailers. I talked before about the MADRID project at Sam's Club and what we've done at Wal-Mart and other places.","Those retailer initiatives are bringing in new clients and getting an increased return on their investment from retailers. [indiscernible] now runs our US business. He was running retail. We are putting this together in a really simple way. I'm excited about what we're going to do there in the U.S. with new initiatives.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the technology discussion. I guess, I am not quite clear how aggressive and, I guess, how all-encompassing is the transformation you're trying to pursue. Is this all the back-end systems as well as the front-end systems?","And, I guess, when you talk about trying to push as fast as you can over the next 12 to 24 months, are you envisioning that, at the end of 12 to 24 months, you would be kind of fully completed with this and most of the systems on the cloud and most of the old systems retired, I guess? What's the kind of end line you're talking about in 12 to 24 months? Thanks.","David Kenny","Yeah. Tim,, I'm not going to put a final date on it, but this is the right time frame. At the end of it, we do need the vast majority of our systems to have our data ingested, stored, computed and delivered on public cloud.","And other companies have done this. The public cloud companies, from the very top, are engaged on this. We're a really good client for them and [indiscernible]. So, we have a good road map to make that work.","And I would say, at the top level, we've got a clear vision. I think the key to it -- and, yes, it does mean moving them, and it is pretty aggressive and it is both the back-end and the front end.","And quite honestly, getting the back end right and getting the data lives right is the most important because those are horizontal. They serve all the applications. And then, the applications can be built on it.","Where I think there might have been, in my view, some mistakes in the past was to try to fix the front end first because just putting a new UX on top of the old back-end doesn't scale the same way. So, the big change here is actually doing it end-to-end.","And then, I would say the other thing that's super aggressive here is to make sure that we work with our clients to get them all on the platform. Maintaining multiple legacy systems is a killer to your economics. And we've got to show more courage on that.","And I think our clients, as they also are dealing with their own architecture, are more open to that answer now than they might have been three, four years ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thank you. Hey. Really helpful to frame things up, particularly given the different scenarios. Is there a way to think about -- as you're planning the business -- because, obviously, you frame three really different scenarios, a probability of each one. It may be difficult to kind of frame that out, but it seems like there is more focus on kind of the Watch versus the Buy just based on the prepared remarks.","Just any way to think about the probability of the different outcomes as you're planning the business because you did a real nice job of kind of framing this within the context of a lot of cross current from an activity perspective?","David Kenny","Let me take -- it sounds like there's two questions there. First of all, I want to be clear that I'm not putting more focus on the Media business versus the Connect business. There is an equal focus on both.","Obviously, given the margins and profitability of the Media business, it's a more critical driver of shareholder value, given its size. So, that's probably why you heard on it. But there are equal efforts on both and both have opportunities and strengths.","In terms of the scenarios, this is just not the moment to go into any details on the strategic review. I've been very clear. There's three potential outcomes and that decision will be made when we've got the facts, which is not just in our control, but the other people we're talking to. As soon as we can give an update, we will.","Operator","Our next question comes from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Surinder Thind","Good morning, guys. David, maybe just following up on the earlier question here, a big picture question on maybe how you approach decision-making. In terms of like how patient are you willing to be to see some of the results, at what point do you think about changing course or when you're evaluating the investments?","And if we were to maybe apply that to the previous question about the strategic review and maximizing shareholder value, like how do you decide between maybe pocketing a dollar today or waiting to maybe earn $2 tomorrow?","David Kenny","Yeah. So, patience isn't my strong suit. I think that -- and that's just reflective of the end markets we're in. We're certainly running fast sprints to make faster, bolder decisions and to focus on execution. And, certainly, the execution isn't performing as it needs to. We need to change people, process, decision-making to make that happen. And focus on those everyday decisions to make that work.","In terms of the strategic review, listen, I think the Board just got to look at that in a risk-adjusted way when we got all the facts. What I'm looking at is just to make sure that we are all aligned on this decision and executing it.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back to David Kinney for closing remarks.","David Kenny","Hey, listen. Thanks, everybody, for joining. Sorry, we ran a little over. I'm enthusiastic about what we're doing and I appreciate the chance to be clear and a little bit detailed on this. Our vision around product is increasingly clear. Our vision about how we deliver is increasingly clear. We have work to do on execution and we're making a lot of progress. And I'm 90% focused on the exclusion right now. We will continue the strategic view and we will get back to you as soon as we have an answer on that. Thanks, again. We look forward to keeping you updated. Bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

My name is Carol, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2019 Nielsen Holdings Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Sara Gubins","Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's first quarter financial performance. I'm here with our CEO, David Kenny and our CFO, Dave Anderson. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website. ","Before we begin, I'd like to remind all of you that our remarks and responses to your questions today may contain forward-looking statements, including those about Nielsen's outlook and prospects that are based on Nielsen's current expectations. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC, which are available on our website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.","On today's call, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, which is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at Nielsen.com. [Operator Instructions].","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, David Kenny.","David Kenny","Good morning. Thank you, Sara. Let me tell at a brief high-level comment and then turn it over to Dave who can review first quarter results, provide some color on our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of 2019. Then I'll come back and give you an update on our strategy and progress, particularly around our products in both Nielsen Media and Nielsen Connect. ","But first of all, let me start with the strategic review, which is taking a lot of my time and most of the senior management's time. This is an ongoing and active process, and as we've said before, it could lead to 1 of 3 potential outcomes; we could continue to operate as a public independent company, we could separate the Global Connect segment from the Global Media segment or we could sell the entire company. ","We have made significant progress over the last 8 weeks since our last video. I want to assure you that the Board and the management are working as quickly as we can to complete the strategic review in as timely a manner as possible. That said, in parallel, we're also focusing on improving our operations. I am pleased with our first quarter results, which did come in better than our expectations. This means we're on track to deliver on our 2019 guidance, which is an important step in building our credibility. At the same time, I have to say that I'm dissatisfied with Nielsen's growth rate relative to our potential. We have a critical role in the industry we serve, we have unparalleled assets, we have strong client relationships, industry-leading talent and a global footprint. That creates the foundation for a stronger product and better growth over time. ","Let me now turn the call back to Dave to review the quarter and then I'll return at the end with an update on the tangible steps we're taking to accelerate our velocity. Dave?","David Anderson","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I'm going to walk you through -- starting with Slide #5, I'm going to walk you briefly through the key topics that I'd like to cover this morning and some of the key takeaways. First, as David said, we're obviously pleased with the results for Nielsen for the first quarter. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were ahead of our expectations. The year-over-year margin rate improvement is a product of both better revenue as well as our productivity initiatives. And adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 despite a higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. And free cash flow came in within our expected range and represented an improvement on a year-over-year basis. I'll talk more about that in a little bit. ","Overall, the results reflect the commitment of our business leaders and our associates worldwide. Our hats off to them and our appreciation to them, and also, the increase in operational and financial rigor that we're seeing across the organization. And as we've said before, we're focused on delivering all fronts. ","And finally, as David mentioned, we're reiterating our guidance for 2019. I'm going to provide you some more color on our expectations for the second quarter as well as the second half after I briefly go through the results for the quarter. ","So with that, let's go to Slide 6 and take a look at the highlights. The company revenue increased 0.4% for the first quarter on a constant currency basis. This compares to our expectations of roughly flat. We saw some additional strength in both media and connect in the first quarter. Revenue decreased 0.2% on an organic basis, constant currency, but if you exclude the impact of onetime items in the year-ago quarter, organic revenue actually grew 1.1%. ","For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $415 million, up 0.5% constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 26.6%, up 2 basis points on a constant currency basis, and again, ahead of expectations. Margins reflect the positive performance on productivity, partially offset by investments that we're making in both our people and in our businesses. ","The first quarter tax rate of 41% was well above the 33% to 35% forecast for the full year. It's a fairly simple explanation. We had several discrete items in the quarter related to tax contingencies and audit. I'm going to talk about tax a little bit more as I talk about the outlook for the rest of the year. ","Adjusted EPS was $0.35, that compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2018. And as we explained when we provided the original guide for the full year, this difference is expected driven by higher depreciation and amortization, higher effective tax rate and also lower EBITDA. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 36% -- 41%, in the first quarter of 2018 was 36%. So the 41% rate in 2019 impacted the quarter by about $0.01. ","Free cash flow was a use of $165 million in the quarter compared to a use of $245 million in the first quarter of 2018. And relative to last year, free cash flow benefited from lower retail payments and also lower incentive payouts. Overall, looking at the first quarter, while it's still early in the year, these results certainly strengthen our confidence in the 2019 outlook. ","We're going to now -- I'd like to just spend a couple of minutes going through each of the segments, and as you know, we've organized to now managing fully around the two segments, Media and Connect. The segment categories are based around our core measurement platforms in both Media and Connect with plan\/optimize and predict\/activate designed to build on measurement and also to add value to our clients by enhancing their decision-making. So let's start with Media on Slide #7. Revenue for the first quarter was $826 million, up 1.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. If we adjust for M&A and also the impact of the prior year TV brand effect, media revenue would have been up 1.4% year-over-year. Audience measurement was up 2.2% constant currency. This reflected underlying strength in national TV, double-digit growth in digital, but as expected, local TV was [indiscernible] up slightly year-over-year. ","For Plan and optimize within Media, it was down 0.9% constant currency, but again, if you adjust for M&A and other items, plan\/optimize was about flat year-over-year. We saw solid growth in Gracenote in ROI and also in attribution capabilities. These were offset by a drag in our telecommunications practice related to timing of a contract. ","Media's adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, up 0.6% constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 42%, down 32 basis points constant currency. The decline was mostly driven by investments in strategic investments and partially offset by productivity. In Connect, on Slide 8, the first quarter revenue, which you can see, was $737 million, down 0.7% constant currency. The impact from M&A was negligible in the quarter. The onetime items from a year ago were a drag to revenue growth by 150 basis points. ","Revenue in measure was $539 million, up 1.7% constant currency, reflecting strong performance in our core retail measurement service and also improved U.S. trends. Revenue in predict and activate was $198 million, down 6.6% constant currency. The most important factor influencing predict and activate revenue was the continued pressure in our innovation and our customer insights businesses. ","Developed markets revenue was down 0.8% constant currency. Just FYI, while revenue declined in the U.S., we saw an improvement in the rate of decline in the U.S. in the first quarter and we also saw continued stability in Europe. Emerging markets revenue was down 0.7% in the first quarter. Regarding China, we had soft performance in the quarter, partly as a result of a tough comp against the first quarter of last year, but we expect improvement during the course of the year. Connect adjusted EBITDA was $79 million, flat year-over-year in constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 10.7%, up 7 basis points constant currency as revenue declines were offset by productivity initiatives. ","Let's go now look at the outlook for 2019. You can see here summary takeaway and not to go through any of the details here, this slide is consistent with what we've covered with you before. And so it's probably good just to go through then the key metrics, which you can reference on Slide 9. This includes total company constant currency revenue to be approximately flat to 1.5%, an improved trajectory from 2018. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 28% to 29% or roughly flat year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA margin will be driven by significant productivity, partially offset by reinvestment in the business. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.77, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense compared to 2018 as well as higher interest expense. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million, and at the midpoint, it'd be roughly flat with 2018. ","And as we discussed last quarter, key drivers include lower incentive compensation payouts in 2019 and also, lower retailer payments offset in part by higher cash interests and cash taxes. Now we will provide a commentary on additional inputs to our key 2019 financial metrics in the appendix of the slide. ","Turning to Slide 10, I won't spend time on this, but here, we've laid out the revenue outlook by segment for 2019. This is consistent with what we've shared with you last quarter. So with that, let's go to Slide 11. Let me talk about what we anticipate in terms of the timing of the outlook for the remainder of 2019. We expect second quarter revenue to be flat to up slightly year-over-year in constant currency. Again, we continue to expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. In revenue, we had some onetime items in the first half of 2018 that make for a more difficult comparison in the first half of 2019. ","For the second quarter, we expect margins to be roughly flat year-over-year. We'll also see the benefit of the productivity initiatives that will be paced through quarters two through four, which will provide support for reinvestment as well as growth initiatives. I'd also note that we anticipate the conclusion of tax audits in various countries during the second and third quarters. If this occurs, it would translate to an effective book tax rate below our 33% to 35% guidance, but we'll continue to provide you with a normalized tax rate, which we anticipate to continue to be in the range of the original 33% to 35% for 2019. ","And finally, we expect second quarter free cash flow to be slightly down to flat. As we discussed with you, we have an aggressive improvement plan underway for cash flow with a lot of organizational focus around it. ","In summary, we're confident in our plan. We have a strong commitment to deliver on all fronts and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress. ","And with that, I'm going to turn it back to David for some of his comments on the company and our outlook.","David Kenny","Thank you, Dave. As I said before, I'm pleased with our progress, but I also believe we have the opportunity to improve our growth trajectory over time. Toward that end, we're working hard to transform Nielsen into a truly product-driven, technology-enabled organization. I would also say that our first quarter gave us increased confidence in our 2019 guidance as well as some early validation of our product direction. So today, what I want to do is give you some specific examples of how our product is being received in the market. ","Let me start with Nielsen Global Media. Our mission here is to be the one media truth across the entire media ecosystem, which creates metrics that monetize for our clients. And then we leverage those metrics to provide the tools our clients need to plan and optimize their media spend or their media offerings. First, let me talk about market adoption of audience measurement and how Nielsen continues to broaden our measurement across both linear and digital video to give a total audience view. This is being demanded by and it's paying off with our clients. As I said, let me give some specific examples. ","One, we continue to work closely with NBCU on the evolution and industry adoption of CFlight, which is underpinned by Nielsen currency data. This offers an advanced way to buy and sell advertising across platforms. We're working to expand the CFlight concept across the industry with Viacom also planning to use the same metrics during their 2019 upfront negotiations. We're also continuing to work on advancements in local TV measurements and we're testing and validating additional data. This is great news for our local clients and we are getting positive feedback from them on our progress. ","Towards that end, we also announced a long-term agreement with Univision for national and local TV ratings measurement, which included for the first time, some of our newer total audience measurement solution, such as out-of-home and subscription video on-demand. I would also say that media is becoming increasingly digital and that means that we have the opportunity to deliver innovative new solutions that help clients monetize their digital audiences. Again, let me give you some specific examples. We're working with all the major players around connected TV. This includes Hulu, Roku, NBCUniversal and many others. On the new front, YouTube is offering Nielsen-based audience delivery guarantees, which enable advertisers to better use YouTube TV to fill in the gaps of their traditional TV campaigns. ","And lastly, we continue to measure Netflix. That data shows that 72% of the minutes spent on Netflix are on non-original programming or reruns. This is a critical input to our media clients that are now investing in their own streaming services, which we also measure through our total audience framework. In media, we also have a terrific global opportunity. And over the first quarter, I had a chance to visit some of our international markets and heard that firsthand. Our mission is to be the one media truth worldwide. Today, international or non-U.S. is approximately 15% of Nielsen Global Media revenues. That said, we are already in more than 50 markets around the world and we're reallocating key talent and resources to our commercial efforts and product efforts outside the United States, which leverage our global presence and continue to consolidate platforms and create globally syndicated solutions to drive efficiency and growth. ","We had a really notable achievement in the last few weeks in Mexico. There, our television audience measurement was accredited by the Media Rating Council. This is the first and only service outside the U.S. to receive the MRC's accreditation. This provides the media industry in Mexico with an additional level of confidence. They leverage Nielsen measurements to account for television audiences and transact in a reliable and effective way. ","Let me now talk about the plan and optimize part of Nielsen Global Media. Remember that many of these capabilities are part of our overall digital portfolio, which provide the market with extensive offerings to help manage the demand of the complex digital landscape, and we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth. Our digital business will be a mix of plan\/optimize and measurement. ","Again, let me give you some specific examples. One, we're working with a large brand marketer to bring together Nielsen's digital attribution capability with Nielsen's cloud-based identity platform. This enables the marketer to better target addressable consumers, and importantly, close the loop on sales, which creates transparency and accountability for the return on investment for each of their ad dollars. This client's CMO is incredibly proud of their approach to people-based marketing and the quantifiable benefits and we're getting really positive feedback from them about how the Nielsen platform works. In another example, one of the large agency holding companies just expanded their use of Nielsen's planning tools to help them enhance their overall ad buys with a much deeper understanding of the unduplicated reach of the digital audience, which leads to a more efficient media plan. ","And finally, we also just renewed the Nielsen audio contract with Entercom. This includes several new plan and optimize services, which help the Entercom sales teams demonstrate the value of radio advertising to their advertisers. This is part of our continued investment to make the audio platform deliver both measurement and analytic benefits for our clients. To sum up on Nielsen Global Media, we continue to see market validation of our total audience measurement offerings. We also have the opportunity to drive accelerated growth outside of the United States and accelerated growth in the plan and optimize services. We are focused on the product road map that will bring more solutions to clients to help accelerate growth both for our clients and for Nielsen. ","Let me turn now to Nielsen Global Connect, where we connect retailers and manufacturers within the fast-moving consumer goods ecosystem. Here, we have a clear opportunity to strengthen our competitive position, restore our revenue growth and improve profit. And the U.S. turnaround that Dave talked about is a big part of that story. ","Again, I'm pleased with our progress in Q1, but I'm again not at all happy with our growth status. We're making progress on the Nielsen Connect platform and its ability to drive growth. It's a key differentiator in terms of what that platform can do. We have another large deployment of the end-to-end system, which is driving faster decision-making and we're also working well with 400 and growing clients who are already using components of the system. We have a strong pipeline of committed end-to-end client deployments for Nielsen Connect in the U.S. and they span a broad range of FMCG manufacturers and retailers. ","Again, let me give you some specific examples in the Connect segment. First of all, in measurement, which is the bedrock of our Connect business, we saw relative global strength in the first quarter with both retailers and manufacturers. Let me talk about the retailers, which remain a key focus and we are driving increased collaboration between the retailers and the manufacturers. Some examples. In the United States, our Walmart and Sam's collaboration program continue to open this up to work with a whole new roster of small and mid-tier clients. We have more than 900 clients signed up for those collaboration programs and more than 75% of those are new to Nielsen. ","China is also a big focus. We do expect China's trajectory to improve during the year as we launch our retail measurement coverage enhancement. In China, we also have a renewed agreement with JD.com, which gives us more access to content and expand our codeveloped analytic suites to include online price and promotion services. In Europe, we expanded our relationship with Aldi, most recently adding Italy and Netherlands to the roster and we just inked a multi-year loyalty analytics deal in Thailand with Big C, which is a major retailer in Southeast Asia. On the manufacturer side of Nielsen Global Connect, we also had some recent client renewals that provide market validation for our product road map. For example, we renewed [indiscernible] a global skincare brand and this was underpinned largely by their confidence in the direction of the Nielsen Connect platform. ","We also renewed our global multi-year contract with Johnson & Johnson Consumer. I should also note here in New York, all week, we've got our data science team and their data science team doing a hackathon so that together with J&J, we can uncover new insights for their business and it's just an example of the way we're working more closely and more technically with our clients. Our ability to offer both measurement and analytics in all the major markets around the world remains a key differentiator. ","Let me go to the predict and activate side. My comments here will largely echo what I said about plan and optimize. This should be a real growth driver over time. We have an opportunity to leverage our measurement data to drive faster growth as we move from point solutions to a modern machine learning-based analytics platform aligned on a single open architecture. We're driving greater analytic solutions to optimize decision-making in several key areas, including category management, assortment, supply chain and promotion and we're seeing good demands for these services from our clients. Towards that end, we recently signed 2 global assortment and space optimization deals with Mars and a global tobacco giant and our price and promotion analytics are helping to drive additional traffic at Smart & Final, a regional value retailer and at Precinct, a regional discount retailer, who're also making notable progress on strengthening the assortment helped by our analytics partnership with them. Our work with Freds is also helping them to collaborate more closely with their vendors through a focused data strategy. ","So let me sum up on Nielsen Global Connect, we have strengthened our value proposition for both the retailer and the manufacturer. We're getting positive reactions to our road map and to the early functionality of the connect platform. We're continuing to grow our global relationships and we're also adding more local relationships. Our U.S. business, which is about 30% of total connect, is stabilizing. Moving beyond our client operations, let me talk about the way we look internally on productivity. We did commit to 370 basis points of gross productivity in 2019 to free up investment capital, so this is largely going to be offset by investments in the growth initiatives. We're on track to deliver this gross productivity. ","Again, let me give you some tangible examples from Q1. We made a huge acceleration in our journey to align on a single cloud-based architecture in both Media and Connect. And on the Connect side, our 3 super hubs are now fully operational delivering data to 25 major countries with over 500,000 unique deliverable shipped. We're also driving a lot of efficiency and quality through the automation of our field data collection. Over 65 markets are now live with our digital data collection platform and our quality control towers, which represents a significant acceleration from the original time line. These are live in over 10 markets with the added benefit of machine learning and image recognition deploying our e-collection methodology. ","So let me close and get to your questions. Across the board, our Nielsen teams are working hard to execute our growth strategy and deliver on our 2019 plan. These efforts are in parallel to a lot of hard work also being done on the strategic review. No matter the outcome of the strategic review, we are taking the right steps to best position your company for the long term and maximize value for our shareholders. I look forward to updating you on our progress. ","Let me know turn it back to Sara to manage Q&A. Sara?","Sara Gubins","Thanks, David. Carol, we're ready to open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","When discussing Slide 8, which is Nielsen Connect, you cited continued CPG end market pressures but the U.S. improving. So I want to get a sense of 2 things. One, quantitatively, how did Nielsen Connect U.S. revenues do in the first quarter, when you say improving? And when you said improving, did you mean the end market U.S. CPG is improving or did you mean Nielsen Connect U.S. revenues were improving?","David Anderson","Thank you. So specifically, what I meant is that Nielsen revenues are improving. So we had -- as I think I may have mentioned, we had decline. I may have mentioned as total developed, but the decline in the U.S. was less than we experienced last year. We're obviously very, very pleased with that performance. We're also very pleased with the performance that we had in our measurement business there, which is a bright spot for us. And as we guided at the beginning of the year, we expect that we'll see for total developed, in Connect, we'll see continued relatively good performance over the rest of this year and the team is executing very well on that. So very pleased by what we did in the U.S., very pleased by the focus that we have and a number of the accounts that we're seeing where we're seeing very positive response to offering both on the measurement side, but also increasingly on the predict and activate side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler","In terms of the win or the progress on the full end-to-end connect system, I guess it sounds like you have signed clients there, there is more in the pipeline, but could you just give us some more detail, how many clients are live on the end-to-end system today? Roughly what was the size of the pipeline, just any targets, any road maps there? And then, how long does it typically take to do the implementation for a end-to-end client on the connect system?","David Kenny","Yes. So as I told you before, we've got 100, close to 400 that are using at least one component as they migrate to the end-to-end system. We've only got a couple that are using the full end-to-end system. We've got dozens in the pipeline to roll out this year. I would say that we're making progress on the inside. It can take a couple of months to get it up and running. And I would say, it really comes down to how much the clients are willing to use a standard connect report versus customizing to what they've done before. And it just takes a little bit of management to make sure people use the system as designed as opposed to retrofitting it back to where they were before. So every time we do this, we're making progress. We're working with folks on getting ready for their installations this year. We're making a lot of progress in the adoption of the standard system.","David Anderson","But I think one thing maybe to add and I think you may have referenced it in your summary comments, but feedback from those that are really increasing the penetration and usage of Nielsen Connect has been very positive. We've got some tremendous testimonials from our clients with respect to the adoption of the system. So -- and in addition to what we're seeing and what David said in terms of the numbers, there is also the qualitative side of this, which has been very positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","I was hoping you could talk about the pricing environment in both segments really, but specifically, also within media for national as well as for local?","David Kenny","Yes, I think that there certainly are changes going on in the -- and I think all the media owners focused on their costs, of course we're having price discussions. I mentioned a couple of renewals, which were right where we expected them to be. So in the end, these are closings in the right place. I would say that the discussions turning to value and also making sure that we're adjusting the mix of services so that they're using more of the digital and analytic services in their renewals, which reflects the strategies of our clients. And I think on the connect side, again, of course, we're always going to have negotiations, but I think as we have increased the value in being able to show how we make our clients more efficient and more effective, it's becoming I think relatively more straightforward to get those deals closed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","I just wanted to get your latest on the GDPR impact the business had seen, where you see the, I guess, remaining impact today and how we should think of that going forward?","David Kenny","Yes. So listen, on GDPR, certainly, there was some float on there and we retooled our capabilities to be fully compliant. We're very respectful and encouraged by privacy. So I think we got through those product changes. And we're seeing what we expected, which is an improvement in the pipeline for our attribution products. I think clients are going to continue to test that and make sure that privacy works for them as well, which we're happy with. I would also say GDPR is just a first aspect of privacy. We're also watching closely things like the California Consumer Privacy Act, which will become effective in January 2020 and other things happening in the U.S. and several other things happening around the world there. I think we're getting in front of this. We're understanding not only the regulation, but the way to be compliant with it to make sure we continue to become a gold standard in the way privacy is managed and we do think it will continue to affect our business and in a way that can actually be quite positive and differentiated for Nielsen's approach over time.","David Anderson","David, I might just add very quickly, as I think, most folks are clearly aware that we built in, in our guidance some continued pressures related to privacy in terms of media plan and optimize. So that's reflected in the numbers that we've provided to you. And this is -- as David said, this is something that's going to be with us for a while. We've made tremendous, we think, responses and positive adjustments that it's going to be something that's going to be with us. So that's part of the reason we've got plan\/optimize as it is in terms of our guide for the full year for Media.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger","David, if I could, I'd love to return a bit to the discussion which you sort of started on the mix shift and increasing role of digital within the media business. If I could, I'd love to take that a step further and get a chance to get your thoughts, especially given all the places you've been in your career. A concern that many people have about what the long-term implications are of the increased mix shift toward digital and away from linear consumption in advertising. And there is a concern that investors have that maybe Nielsen gets monetized less in the digital side proportionate to the size of that market in linear. I don't know if you agree with that concern or what you think. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the impact of that mix shift over time.","David Kenny","Well, thank you, Todd. And of course, my decision to join Nielsen at the end of last year was because I believe Nielsen has exactly the right portfolio to grow as our clients move into digital. There are a lot more needs in digital. And a lot of work was done before I got here and we're picking up the pace in the past few months since I arrived. It's somewhat different. So first of all, measurement continues to be important and I would say we've got a growing demand for independent holistic measurement. I think having the platform to create their own homework is of concern to the advertisers and they're being more vocal about it. So when we've got measurement assets like digital ad ratings, digital content ratings, subscription VOD content ratings, et cetera, these all help us serve the measurement side in a really important way. But I would also say that, that data is increasingly feeding the analytics platform and we should continue to also see growth in planning and optimization with tools like Digital Brand Effect, we've got with Gracenote, with the ACR, what we do with multi-touch attribution, et cetera. So we're seeing an increased growth on the analytics side from digital. When we look at digital, I do look at both the analytic side and the measurement side and I would tell you it's becoming a meaningful and growing part of the portfolio. This is a transition, but it's a transition our clients are going through, it's a transition the market is going through. And I do believe only Nielsen can do this. I think our installed base, what we already do with our panels gives us -- and our role in currency gives us a chance to and actually have responsibility to lead the industry. So it's a transition, but I think it's a good healthy transition that opens more doors for us over time, in terms of growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust.","Matthew Thornton","Maybe the first one, and I apologize if I missed this. Can you talk a little bit about local and rolling in some of the big census level data sets that guys you have, when we might see that and whether you'd expect that to kind of to turn the tide there? And then just secondly, you talked a little bit about China, kind of -- the headwind kind of reversing course here in the back half of the year. Can you just put a little meat on that just to understand again what gives you confidence in that turn, that would be helpful?","David Kenny","So first of all, on local, as I said in my remarks, we're adding more data sets, both proprietary Nielsen data sets and acquired data sets and we're testing on improving those. So we're beginning to share the results not yet in a currency way. This is an industry move. We're working closely with the MRC. We do want to retain quality standards and independent accreditation on that. So we're working through that process. Certainly, in this year, we expect to make real progress and evolve what we're doing in local. I would also say as we're showing that to clients, they are signing on. So in the recent months, we've renewed a number of big local clients, including Raycom, Cox, Hearst and as I said, Univision and I would say that the pipeline is real strong. There is a lot of energy around where we're going in local and I do believe we're cracking the code there. ","In terms of China, and I spent some time in there and planning to go there in a few weeks, again that's more of a connect business. And I would say, it's going to improve because we're expanding coverage, that we're measuring more places, both geographically and we've made real strides in e-commerce, which help revenue grow there. One of those opportunities, as I said, was the renewal with JD.com and that renewal gives us access now to much more timely data, allows us to move to weekly reporting and also launch analytic services, including an online to off-line price and promotion model. So I feel like we've got the right partners, I feel like we've got the right clients and a lot of the product opportunities [indiscernible] made a lot of progress. And just judging from the number of clients JD is getting setting up and the pipeline there, I think the local team is executing quite well.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","In your Connect business, your revenue declines are continuing to moderate, can you just elaborate on the overall health of the CPG end markets, both in developed and emerging markets? And what you would say the top 1 or 2 initiatives are internally to drive a return to positive overall constant currency growth here?","David Kenny","Yes. So first of all, listen, I think it hasn't changed in the end markets, but I think both the retailers and the manufacturers continue to focus on value for consumer. And so that means that they're watching pricing and they're watching their offering, but they are making progress. I think in terms of our connect, what we are also seeing is a number of smaller players emerging, what you might call the long tail. And I would say there these sort of long tail sort of small and mid-sized clients are the ones that are growing the fastest. In fact, they grew 65% in the U.S. alone during the first quarter. ","Secondly, in terms of the fact that they're focused on value means that they need to be more precise, so that's where we're seeing more focus on analytics. And our analytics business within existing clients did grow 55% off a small base in Q1. And then lastly, I would say, the end markets are also integrating and collaborating much more. So as retailers are collaborating with their manufacturers, there is a need for them to do that in a common way with a common set of data, and again, the Nielsen data is the only data that can really do that at scale. So we're seeing real growth there as well. So those are the operational things that are driving, as Dave said, the sort of improved performance in the U.S. and the growth around the world. I would say that should pick up as the connected system grows as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","So at the November 2017 Investor Day, the previous management team laid out a plan for $500 million in cost savings, about $400 million from automation and consolidation and another $100 million from SG&A. Now that you've both spent some time at the company, how are you feeling about the potential for cost savings at the business? Is $500 million still a reasonable goal? And if it's a reasonable goal, is it likely to be reinvested or does it have a chance to fall to the bottom line?","David Anderson","So, Bill, let me start, just give you some perspective there, add a little bit to David's comments on productivity. First of all, as I mentioned in the first quarter results, we're very pleased about the fall through, if you will, of some of the favorability we had relative to our expectations on revenue to EBITDA and EBITDA margin and that reflects the focus on productivity and the delivery of productivity that we have. The second thing is that we really haven't provided an update to that prior -- the prior number from prior leadership. But I will tell you we're really confident based on what we've seen, what we're doing that we've got a real strong line of sight to deliver what we shared with you in our original 2019 guide in the walk -- in the EBITDA walk that we provided to you in terms of the gross productivity that we can deliver this year of that. Strong line of sight and actual in line programs that are going to deliver against those numbers. I think relative to the broader longer-term kind of potential, it's something that we look forward to updating you on at the right time. But right now, our real focus is just on executing and delivering against these 2019 numbers.","David Kenny","Let me just add, to remind you, that's 370 basis points of gross productivity and we're very confident in that and are executing. What I would say is the best productivity is always going to come from improving the top line. I will not hesitate to invest in growth opportunities. At the same time, if we invest, we're going to invest with clear business cases and with accountability for that growth. So I would say it's not automatically just being reinvested. We're creating the opportunities to invest, but we're being pretty rigorous about really understanding what those investments are, whether they be client coverage or product, making sure that we [indiscernible] as we do that. So I think that it will be far more transparent as opposed to just a sort of loose deal on reinvestment. And I'm really happy with the productivity that's giving us the chance to look at some of these, I think, really terrific opportunities to improve our growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","So my question was about retiring -- retirement of legacy systems. David, if you can provide any feedback or if you have received any client pushback on retiring the legacy systems? And then you also talked about acceleration in the journey to single cloud-based architecture. Now that you've been there for a few months, do you have a feel for how long does the transition take in terms of timing?","David Kenny","Yes. So on the last part, I would say I'm not yet ready to give you a final data on it, but with my prior experience and certainly, the folks who are helping us, you've got a couple of years to get a full transition completed. So we're certainly working on that. I'd like to make it a little sooner, certainly working on velocity, but some of these things just take cycles and internally some recoding to be able to work in the right way. And we want to do it right, not just task.","Secondly, on the retirement of legacy systems, I think we're working really hard for clients to understand the benefit of having Nielsen on a single architecture and the benefit of doing things in a more common and therefore, scalable way. One of those benefits is on the connect side that you can bring in other partners. So there is over 60 partners that have now signed up to be part of the connected system, which gives our clients a lot of opportunity beyond just the services from Nielsen to use that data. And similarly in media, as our clients get more robust and as they become digital first, being able to bring all those tools in is one of the benefits from this change. And lastly, I'd say in some of the legacy systems, clients just are thrilled to see us move to more modern systems and the benefit is immediate. The things that are at the front line that affect the way they operate, we have to work with them on that transition and we're doing that aggressively now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Surinder Thind from Jefferies.","Surinder Thind","David, I just wanted to touch base on one of the first comments that you made to start the call. I think you indicated that you are pleased with the 1Q results but dissatisfied with the growth rate. Can you provide some additional color on the growth rate comment, maybe perhaps what you see is the long-term potential of the business or what might be a number that you guys are thinking about or that you would be satisfied with?","David Kenny","So all I'm going to say is that the number is faster than right now, but I think if you get to specifics, that is part of the work we're doing with in the strategic review, actually it's helping us to sort out really where are the opportunities and what does the growth look like as we get more focused on fewer, bigger, bolder initiatives versus a lot of small ones. What I would say is we also look at the market growth rate in our end markets and we should at least be growing at those rates in order to maintain our relevance. So we're making sure that we are deeply embedded in the way metrics are monetized and we're deeply embedded in the analytics that help people get more efficient. So I think we're certainly looking at it from a market share and market growth perspective as well as organically what we believe our products can deliver. And at the right time, we'll come back with a specific number, that's certainly part of the strategic review process to get that right.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And I'll turn our call back to Sara Gubins for closing remarks.","Sara Gubins","Great. Thank you, Carol, and thank you all for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 13, 2014, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I will now turn the call over to your host for today's call, Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Vanek, please proceed.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial performance. Joining me on today's call is -- from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Chief Financial Officer.","A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website at nielsen.com\\investors. Please note in the appendix of the slide presentation are not only the normal GAAP reconciliations, but also a few slides to walk you through a small recast we did during the quarter between our Buy and our Watch segments. Please call us with any questions you might have on this.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you of the meeting [ph] the discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, February 13, 2014. Our actual results from future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in Nielsen's 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find on nielsen.com\\investors.","For today's call, Mitch will start with comments on our results for the quarter and the year and give some overviews of some key highlights, then provide a business update. Then, Brian will discuss financials for the quarter and discuss our full year guidance. From there, we'll turn to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","And now to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. This is my first earnings call in this seat, and it's good to be with you, and thanks for joining. So let's dive right in.","2013 was another year of steady and consistent performance in growth both for our business and for delivering value to our shareholders. Let me walk you through a high-level look at the numbers for the full year.","First, revenue, it grew a little better than 6% on a constant currency basis. And if we exclude our acquisition of Arbitron, which we've renamed Nielsen Audio, the top line grew just under 4%. Next, adjusted EBITDA was up 7.5% or 8.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net income per share grew almost 20%, finishing just a little bit over $2. And the number we all love, our full year cash flow, it was $573 million, up almost 35% versus 2012. These numbers reflect our steady, consistent model. It's a model that leverages our global footprint and scale, and those are incredibly valuable as we serve our global client base.","A few other highlights for 2013 that I want to call to your attention. First, in late September, as you know, we closed our acquisition of Nielsen Audio, and we're thrilled how this one's gone so far. The integration process continues right on track, and we're still comfortable with the cost synergy estimate that we provided at our Investor Day in December, and that was a net savings of $45 million.","2013 also included the ongoing transition in our shareholder base, and now private equity ownership is down to about 1\/3 of our company. That opened the door for us to join the S&P 500 index in July and that was an important milestone for our company.","It was also a busy year for capital allocation. As you know, we follow a balanced framework for capital allocation. In 2013, we initiated a dividend, and then we subsequently increased it in line with our earnings growth. We also announced and implemented the share buyback program. Finally, we reiterate our 2014 core guidance that we communicated at our Investor Day back in December.","So big picture, we feel great about our progress in 2013, and we continue to be very well positioned to deliver steady and consistent growth in 2014 and beyond.","Our business and our priorities, they're guided every day by the 2 big trends operating in our marketplace, namely population growth and media fragmentation. We stay in front -- if we stay in front of these trends by increasing coverage, coverage of sales and coverage of consumers as they consume video and audio and other content in a growing number of ways. And then what we do is we connect the 2 sides. We connect what people watch with what people buy. And we do that to help our clients drive better marketing effectiveness and better marketing efficiency, and these are things we can do better than anybody else. It's a great value proposition for our clients.","So what I want to do now is go into a little more detail about how we did in these areas in 2013, as well as cover some of the opportunities that we see going forward. First, we took steps to increase our coverage in a number of the key growth markets around the world, including Africa, India, China and more recently, Mexico. Almost every client we work with is chasing growth in these markets whether it's in retail sales or video and audio consumption. We're incredibly well positioned here because of our global footprint and our global scale and also because of our global client relationships.","By the way, just a word about our client relationships, you all know that we have long-standing relationships with nearly all of the leading global players in consumer packaged goods, but what's a little less well known is the strong relationships we've built with the big local players in these developing markets, markets like China, India, Africa and all throughout Southeast Asia. The reality is our client portfolio is balanced across the global and local players. And over the long run, that balance, that works to our advantage because in some years, it's the global players who are gaining share, but lately, it's been more the local players who've grown faster, particularly in developing markets.","Next, I'll turn to media fragmentation. Our digital measurement efforts, they progressed very well in 2013, and I'm referring firstly here to our Online Campaign Ratings metric or OCR. It's gaining broad acceptance among both advertisers and publishers and in particular, around video. We feel great about the progress that we made, and we're bullish on the future for OCR, not only for video and display advertising but also for digital audio advertising.","We've also leveraged our OCR capability to extend our measurement of video to mobile devices, tablets and smartphones. The testing and the pilot phases so far have gone very well, and we've gotten very good client feedback. We're on track for the broader market implementation before the new fall TV season begins.","On the social media front, we made a big step forward for measuring those audiences in 2013 with the launch of Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings. This one's been a lot of fun, but more importantly, it's also proving its value to clients as they build use cases and as they tap into the insight that provides for precision marketing and for content programming.","Next, our Ad Solutions business, this part of our business continued to accelerate in 2013. Recall this is where we help advertisers improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of their advertising. One of the many positives of this part of our business is that we work across a number of different verticals, consumer packaged goods, of course, but also auto and financial, entertainment, tech, telecom and a number of others. A big part of what we do here is connecting data that shows what consumers watch to what consumers buy, and we're now starting to do this also for what consumers listen to and what consumers buy. In both of these cases, it's incredibly useful and valuable for advertisers and their agencies in their efforts to improve marketing effectiveness, and it's just as useful for media sellers as they look for the best possible price for their audiences. This whole area is still early in its development, and there's a lot of runway ahead of it, and we love this one.","Now as a result of all of these things that I just walked through, our client relationships, they grew stronger in 2013. That's because we are well positioned against what's important to their business and their growth, and they have confidence in our strategy related to coverage as populations grow and our strategy related to media measurement as audiences continue to fragment. Our major client contract renewals in 2013 went well with clients generally looking for longer terms and broader relationships, both of which are positives for our business model. Ultimately, it's their vote of confidence in our ability to continue delivering value and growth to their business.","So the big picture, our business is strong. We're incredibly well positioned. And as we enter 2014, we're confident, and we feel very good about the path that we're on.","Now I'll turn it over to Brian, and he'll give you a deeper look at the numbers.","Brian J. West","Thanks, Mitch, and hi, everyone. Good morning. So I'm on Page 8. I'm going to run through total Nielsen full year results in a little bit more detail. So what we have here is how we did in '13 in total for the full year, what the year-over-year constant currency growth rates were and then how that compares to the guidance we've got out there.","So I'll start with total revenue, came in at $5.7 billion, up 6.4% year-over-year constant currency, and that compares with the 6% we are guiding towards. Revenue ex Audio, as Mitch mentioned, was a touch under 4% at 3.9% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 8.7%. And we continue to deliver cost productivity while at the same time reinvesting for growth. Margin expanded 61 basis points. Adjusted net income was $770 million. That's up over 23%. And our diluted ANI per share was $2.02, better than our December guide by a couple of cents. Free cash flow was $573 million, up 34.5%, strong performance that reflects the high cash conversion of our business and on our pro forma net debt ratio of 3.5x, which was in line with what we had expected for the year.","So overall, we feel very good about our accomplishments in 2013, steady, consistent core revenue growth of about 4%. Margin expanded while we continued to reinvest. Earnings growth was powerful, and we're delivering very strong free cash flow, enabling the return of capital to our shareholders.","Now I'll dive into the fourth quarter. So on Page 9, total results for Nielsen fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 13% and up 3.7% constant currency excluding the impact of Audio. Adjusted EBITDA was $508 million. That's up 14% constant currency. And margin expanded by almost 30 basis points. We did see the impact of foreign exchange rates in the quarter. There was a 120 basis point drag in revenue and 170 basis point drag on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted income was $274 million in the quarter, up almost 20%, and adjusted net income per share was $0.71. Finally, again, free cash flow, we generated $234 million, which is up 13% year-over-year.","Now let me move on to segment revenue. The fourth quarter marked our team's 30th consecutive quarter of top line growth. Let me start with Buy. Total Buy was just over $900 million, up 2.5% constant currency. Developing markets within Buy were up over 9%, and we continue to see strong double-digit growth in key markets driven primarily, as Mitch mentioned, our local clients. Growth accelerated in the back half of 2013, and we continue to have a high level of confidence in our strategy to invest ahead and increase coverage to the growing middle-class consumer, particularly the developing world. As we head into 2014, we see very good momentum in this part of our business.","Moving onto info services, was $684 million in the quarter. That's up 1% as we expected. We had good growth in developing markets as clients invest more in retail measurement, offset by the developed markets where Western Europe continue to be soft as we expected, and we no longer benefit from last year's covered expansion in the U.S. from Walmart.","Moving onto Insights. Revenue was $219 million in the quarter, up 7%, another good quarter of solid broad-based growth across every region.","Watch revenue, $708 million, up 30% and up almost 6% excluding Audio, a very nice performance in our Watch business. Growth was driven by our steady TV measurement business, as well as strong growth in Ad Solutions as well as our digital products.","Let me make one comment. Kate mentioned at the beginning of the call we had a small reorg in order to align our reporting with our strategy to link Watch and Buy in our Advertiser Solution business. And you'll see in the press release and in the appendix of this document the movement of 2 products that went from Buy Insights to Watch. So now we have a complete view of Ad Solutions within our reported Watch segment. There's a lot of detailed schedules that will help you make sure your models get up to speed. The impact in total is de minimis. In the quarter, fourth quarter, Insights revenue would have had $24 million less revenue. Watch would've had $24 million higher revenue as an example. Again, all of this is laid out in the schedules.","Moving onto profitability. Total EBITDA was over $500 million or 14%, and overall, we continue to execute on our technology infrastructure improvements to drive cost productivity while investing for the long-term growth. Buy EBITDA was just over $200 million and was down almost 5 points and there were 3 drivers in there: One, we accelerated investments in the developing market coverage where, as I mentioned before, we're seeing very good growth; two, platform investments to support new client wins; and three, year-over-year mix shift between our info and insights services business. On the Watch side, Watch EBITDA was $313 million. That's up 32% driven by Audio, as well as the strong performance of our underlying scalability of our business model.","Moving on, I'm now on Page 12, the last time we'll talk about 2013. I'm on the financial metrics box in the upper left. Let me start with CapEx, and I'll focus everyone on the full year 2013 numbers. CapEx $374 million, in line with what we had forecasted; D&A, $510 million, also in line; net book interest, $307 million, in line; cash taxes, $147 million, a couple of million higher than we thought, but the cash tax rate for the business was a strong 16%. And the cash restructuring was $80 million in line.","Free cash flow, I'll spend one more minute on that, $573 million, again, $150 million higher than prior year. I'll also make one note. On Page 7 of the press release, there's an adjustment for onetime Arbitron deal costs of $46 million that I want to point out, so everyone is aware of it. And then I'd also point out on Page 6 of the press release, in the adjusted EBITDA walk, there's a $53 million onetime item in the quarter, which is largely noncash purchase accounting adjustment associated with the Arbitron transaction.","And now moving to the balance sheet in the bottom left, gross debt $6.6 billion, cash $564 million to get to a net debt of just over $6 billion. And again, our pro forma net debt ratio was 3.5x.","Moving to the cap table. In 2013, we repriced $2.9 billion of the loan debt. We refinanced the high coupon 11 5\/8 notes. We funded a portion of Arbitron. And as we enter 2014, we have a healthy cash balance of $564 million. And our weighted average interest rate for the year went down 58 basis points to 4.28%. We continue to work on de-risking the debt portfolio, and we still have opportunities to lower our rate and extend maturities.","Page 13, 2014. We showed this exact page at our December Investor Day. There's no change in the core growth framework, but we did add a 1.5 point growth accretion for the Harris acquisition, so total Nielsen growth rate range is now 11.5% to 13.5% for 2014.","Page 14. 14 is our updated view on the impact of foreign exchange rates. On the left-hand side of the page is a new look at our revenue breakdown, and as you'll see, that 73% of our revenue is in the first 2 lines across 4 currencies, U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and the British pound. The rest of our revenue reflects the broad diversification of our global footprint, and there's no single currency representing more than 3% of total revenue.","The chart on the right is our updated view of the FX -- of the impact of FX rate movements. And this bar chart shows the year-over-year effect on revenue and EBITDA, assuming that yesterday's spot rates remain constant throughout the year. This does not take in account any impact from the potential revaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And as you can see on the far right side, total year revenue EBITDA is negatively impacted by 120 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively.","Two items to note that are important. One, I remind everyone the takeaway. We report on constant currency to reflect our operating performance. We don't take on transactional risk. This is strictly translation impact for reporting purposes. And two, knowing what we know today based on this look, it would impact our adjusted net income per share range, which is reported number, by up to $0.04, which is offset entirely by the accretive impact of the Harris acquisition.","Page 15, last one for me, guidance. So not a lot of change in this chart from when we talked on December. We brought revenue up 1.5 points for Harris to 11.5% to 13.5%. We see margin rates in the 29% to 30% rate for EBITDA, adjusted income between 22% and 27%, ANI per share $2.45 to $2.55. As I mentioned, I didn't change that because, on one hand, I've got the FX strike, on the other hand, I've got the Harris accretion, and they more or less offset. And then free cash flow, a very healthy $700 million. All the other financial metrics on the right-hand side, no change.","So to wrap it up, we're really starting to see the strength of our business model, and the benefits of our investment strategy ultimately enhance returns to our shareholders.","I'll make one last comment on capital allocation. As we've mentioned before, we're committed to a balanced approach, as Mitch mentioned, to return cash to shareholders starting with an attractive ordinary dividend that we intend to grow in line with earnings, as well as the targeted share purchase program. We believe the balanced approach, together with our consistent compounding business model, will create meaningful returns for our investors over time.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Kate.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Operator, we'd love to kick off Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So one question and an unrelated follow-up. Can you give us a little more color regarding the local reach product? I think it just went live and kind of how it's ramping? It seems like it's the local version of your NBI product; it seems to be gaining so much traction nationally. I think you've said in the past the national version has contributed something like 100 bps of growth to the Watch business a quarter, the last couple of quarters. Does local have the potential to do more? Where are we with it? And where are you on sort of NBI digital? And then second, if I can, there's a pretty high profile article in the Journal today about your competitors potentially gaining some traction online in traditional measurement. Seems like from our read of the channels, OCR is gaining a lot of traction itself. So what did you make of the commentary, particularly regarding the potential edge making PPM technology available to competitors as required by the DOJ for a close of Arbitron gives to competitors? Do you think there's something -- like, what was your read of that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","So thanks for the question. First on your question about local buyer reach, that is a part of a lot of things that we're doing in the local market right now. You can even take a step back and look at our Nielsen Audio acquisition. That's a big local play. We have our big local hybrid initiative and then the local buyer reach product that we just launched in the marketplace. Yes, you're exactly right. This is taking our strategy of connecting Watch and Buy, what consumers watch and what consumers buy, and bringing that kind of a view of the world to the local market and the clients in that market. And so we've just rolled out the local buyer reach product to deliver against that part of our strategy for those clients. And it's just rolled out there, so it's still too early to really comment on what it's going to do for our business. But the early response from clients has been fantastic, and we feel great about that. On your second question related to the article that appeared in the Journal this morning, look, I think if we think about our Watch business and you take the broader view, our Watch business numbers really speak for themselves. And look, we're the market leader. It's to be expected that there's going to be some noise around the market leader from time to time. We're used to that. We've seen it before. I'm sure we'll see it again. But the reality is what we do is we measure the consumer across all platforms, and we provide those measures to the marketplace. And we take a very big and very broad approach to the role that we play in the market. We're not out there doing custom projects and sometimes that type of activity does tend to draw some attention. But our role is a broader role, measuring the consumer across all platforms. That's what our strategy and our investments are focused on, and we'll continue to be focused on that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, Mitch, could you give us an update on the competitive landscape on the Buy side? And any signs -- and I'm thinking in particular around Europe and whether or not you're seeing any signs of improving demand there.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, on the Buy side, we're operating in more than 100 countries, 103, soon to be 104 countries around the world. We're more focused on our clients and what our clients' needs are rather than being very focused on competition. The needs that our clients have, the good news is there that their needs are broad, and our relationships with our clients on the Buy side continue to broaden. That's where the Insights part of our business, in particular, tends to come into play. The Insights business, coupled with the information Business, allows us to answer a much broader range of questions for clients around the world. So we're not only measuring their performance, but we're working with them to help drive improved performance in their business. And this is the role that we continue to play. So that's the story behind that particular part of our business. In Europe, turning to Europe for a second, we're still calling it flat from the standpoint of our business, plus or minus. So we're not -- we're seeing some of the same stories that you see in terms of people wondering if Europe is coming back. But for the part of the business that we serve, it really relies on consumers. And whether there are more jobs and whether average household incomes are increasing, that's what matters to the consumer packaged goods firms, in particular on the Buy side of our business. And so whatever might be happening in Europe hasn't shown up yet with consumers, and it might eventually, but that's what we're focused on. So we're still staying with our view of Europe going forward to flat. Our business though, at the same time, is executing very well in Europe, winning market share, gaining new clients. And in particular, one that's come on board for us this year is Mars, not just in Europe but also in markets all around the world. And so we're thrilled about that. The opportunity to help Mars in a much bigger way with their business going forward than we have in the past.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then separately, could you dive a bit more into your reaction around the new comScore-Google relationship and what it means for your longer-term goal to be the measurement currency for video?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. If you look at the big picture, here too, there's some good news here. And the good news is Google continues to show signs of being open to independent third-party measurement. And I think that's good for the industry. It's good for the market, and it's good for Nielsen. So as you know, we announced our deal with Google back in November, and we continue to work with them on that, and we continue to build on that deal. And so stayed tuned on that front. You'll see more happen with regard to the work that we've been doing with Google now for several months. But the bigger picture is Google continues seeing the value in third-party measurement. That door gets opened more broadly, and we view that as a good thing. So we're good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","[Audio Gap]","touched on this, but just given all the noise around emerging markets, which seemed to add some volatility to your stock earlier in the year, can you just provide some more detail on some of your key markets? And has there been any evidence that any of these markets are weakening just given the macro environment in some of the geographies? And I guess, based on what you're seeing, have you changed your priorities at all in terms of where you're investing?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, the long-term story here for us is the story about population growth, growth of the middle-class, and in some of these markets, in particular China, it's about urbanization. And that's going to play out over decades, over the long run. And you might see some short-term acceleration or deceleration in GDP growth rates, things like that. But the population growth story is going to continue steadily and at least for a few more decades. So that's what we're focused on. That's what we invest behind right there. Our play is the coverage play, measuring the consumer, giving that complete view of the consumer to the clients in that market, and that's worked well for us in the past. It will continue to work well for us going forward. As far as the GDP growth rates going up or down a little bit in the short run, which they are inclined to do, our business really isn't that closely tied to GDP. We're still under penetrated in these markets, very under penetrated. So we can grow independently of GDP in many cases. And the other thing that I mentioned earlier in my opening comments, we work a lot with the big global players, but increasingly, our business is growing stronger and stronger with the big local clients in these markets, and that's been really important for us in the last year or 2 as well.","Brian J. West","The other way to add on to that, Suzi, if you look at just what Mitch said, we have in very important markets local books of business growing anywhere from 10% to 30%. So that reinforces that ability to have a very diverse strong business portfolio. I'd also mention, there's 2 ways to think about this for us in the developing world. As I mentioned, we've got broad diversification to all the markets, no one single concentration is meaningful, which is good. And secondly, most importantly, if you know the first couple of quarters of 2013, we were posting 6% revenue growth rates in developing world. The third quarter was close to 8%. The fourth quarter was 9%. So our view of the developing world is strong and has got momentum, and we feel good about it because of this client mix that Mitch mentioned.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So local customers are not more sensitive to these swings in GDP growth. Is that basically what you're saying?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, it is. There -- they might be sensitive to it, but they tend to be up when the global players are down. They don't move in the same way as each other. So that's what gives balance to our business because of that balance in our client portfolio.","Brian J. West","Plus, we are so under penetrated with local clients in these markets. Our big thing is how do you get our local teams to get more feet on the street to call in more new customers because there's a lot out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","At Slide 13, under the Watch segment, this is a sub segmentation of Watch that you started breaking out at Analyst Day, which I appreciated. You're giving you some growth expectations. Could you give me a sense of how the relative sizes are of audience measurement Ad Solution and other within Watch?","Brian J. West","Sure. So audience measurement, I believe, is 80% of that number-ish. And Ad Solution, as we mentioned at Investor Day, is a couple hundred million dollars of revenue. So the rest you saw for other. For us, what is very important as we think about this part of our business is our unique ability to measure all audiences across any device or any platform. That's going to drive some growth because we feel very confident in our digital product strategy. And then there's Ad Solutions, which as Mitch mentioned. You get a whole new set of products, link and Watch and Buy, very unique across verticals outside of just traditional media and CPG.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then the core Nielsen number 4.0 to 6.0, remind me if that's a pure organic number. I actually forgot when we anniversary SocialGuide.","Brian J. West","Yes. I think SocialGuide probably is almost anniversary-ed, and it's so small, it wouldn't even show up. So think about that as pretty darn close to an organic number as you can get.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Your customers in the traditional TV business have been quite complementary, I think, of your efforts lately to develop a broader measurement, including C7 mobile device measurement and VOD. Is it possible to give us a sense, to quantify what that could mean to your traditional TV business? And do you think there's a realistic chance any of those are actually incorporated into the upfront market this season?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Our approach, again, is to measure the consumer across all screens. We already -- with regard to C7, we already provide that measure to the marketplace. It's not really our call whether the market shifts to that from C3 as the currency. We make it available. And so it's the market's call in terms of what they decide to use to trade on as the currency. But our approach will continue to be to do all the things that we have been doing in the area of mobile, in the area of video-on-demand and whatever else the market needs us to do in order to measure the consumer and all of their consumption of video content. That's our strategy. It'll continue to be our strategy, and it'll drive our investments in our product priorities. That's our role, right, to operate on behalf of the industry, and so we stay close to them and in sync with them and always just a little bit ahead if we can.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Okay. But presumably if they become more incorporated in the TV measurement service, it should be some incremental revenue and presumably earnings to you as well, I guess. Is that right, first off? And any sense of timing on that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","That's exactly right, but it's not something that I can really put a number on, either a dollar number or a timing of number. It'll evolve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Arbitron. I think you talked about $15 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter and $30 million in '14. Is that still the number? And is there any updated view on revenue synergies from Arbitron?","Brian J. West","No. We said $45 million net for the program. I don't know if we gave stat specifics. I don't think we gave that. There might in a little bit in the fourth quarter, but most of that synergy is going to be seen in 2014. And in terms of the revenue side, look, we feel the closer we get to the commercial teams and our new audio clients, the better we feel about the ability to, as Mitch mentioned, first start to link local audio audience information with our local retail data, create those linkages, as Mitch described, off to a good start. And then streaming, we have a natural play with our ability to measure digital video and then finally, global opportunities. So we're fast and hard at work at all of those things, and what makes this fun for us is that these are growth opportunities that Arbitron, on its own, never really had the ability to do. We would take those on, and over the long term, we think it's going to create nice growth prospects for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Bird from FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Could you talk about how you see pricing developing in Watch in 2014 and '15? Is there an opportunity to earn higher price given your multi-screen initiatives?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","We have long-term multi-year contracts with all the big players there, so you're not going to see a change in the short term on the Watch side of our business with regard to price.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And separately, in Audio, could you talk about maybe the timeline to getting into some new areas that you alluded to like streaming radio for example?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","I'm sorry, say again.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","For the Audio side of business, could you talk about the timeline to getting into some new product areas like streaming radio, also European radio ratings for example?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Okay. I got you. Yes. Our focus so far, I think appropriately so has been on the integration process in the cost synergy side of that acquisition. And we're really just getting started on the -- on what you might think of as the commercial opportunities and the commercial synergies. As Brian mentioned a moment ago, we see a lot of them out there. But we're going to have to move at the pace of the clients in the marketplace. So too early for us to make a call on that in terms of timing or numbers. Stay tuned on that front. We'll have more to say on that in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick question. Facebook's gotten a little bit more active, doing social TV analytics lately with a partnership with an independent company. I'm just wondering if there's any potential for a change with your relationship there potentially expanding to do something similar to what you do with Twitter on the NTTR?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, we're obviously always in touch with Facebook. We have a very good relationship with them on a number of fronts, and we're open to talking with them about all of those kinds of opportunities in the marketplace. But I don't have anything to comment on specifically beyond that right now related to your exact question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on the Ad Solutions business. Could you give us some more color as to how long it takes to scale up some of the new products and new verticals that you talk about that could potentially put you towards the high end of the guidance range? I mean, I think this Ad Solutions business was $50 million back in '07, you guys had highlighted. So just trying to get a sense of how long it takes to scale up some of the new products.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks for that question. I guess I would probably characterize the development of Ad Solutions differently, not so much scale based. We have the scale. It's already there. I think it's a matter of the market starting to understand what these types of capabilities can do for their business and then for them to work their business processes in the direction of how do you incorporate these and make them part of your flow and leverage them for your business. So that's what's going to govern the growth of this part of our business more than anything related to scale. We've got the scale.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the developing markets exposure. Could you give us a sense of how big local customers are? Are they still 1\/3 of your mix? And within developing markets, how would you characterize your exposure to sort of early-stage versus late-stage markets, Africa versus Brazil or however you want to talk about it?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks. Thanks for that question. First, in terms of local client and how big of a part of the mix they are, it really varies by country to country. In some parts of the world, in some developing markets, they are closer to 1\/3 or maybe even approaching half. In others, it's a much smaller percentage. That'll probably converge over time, but it varies quite a bit. We do have a couple of the key developing markets around the world where our biggest client, our biggest single client is, in fact, the local client. That is the case for India, for example, in 2013, and my guess is it will be true in 2014 as well. So that's what I would say about that. In terms of your second question, early stage, later stage, we see a lot of development that -- I think the right way to think about our early versus later stage, it just comes in waves. Our first objective when we go into a market is just to provide a broad view of the market. And then the next stage is granularity. The clients will want more city-based views or provincial-based views. And so we have to go in waves in the market, develops in waves like that as growth shifts from being driven primarily by distribution and then later on moves to being more marketing driven. You see the mix of our investments and the mix of our product focus shift as well. That's kind of the broad way I would answer your question, your second question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question has to do with the cross-platform measurement efforts and whether or not there's any thought to need to either improve panel size or any technological elements to differentiate versus peers that are now offering more and more products in the same space. And as you talk to your clients, are there any rumblings of potentially any change in the paradigm to now not necessarily have just one currency but more currencies going forward in the deals?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, let's go to panel size. Our cross-platform effort is underpinned by our OCR metric, in particular, on the digital side of that. And if you take a look at what we do with OCR, it is tied to an enormous panel of consumer data in terms of our reliance, our work with Facebook and with Experian and other players there. So panel size really is not an issue at all. It's an incredibly precise, incredibly accurate measure. So we're in a very good spot from a panel-size perspective. Your second question, could you say it again, please?","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess as you talk to clients, the assumption is that ultimately there will be one currency going forward and will just be driven by whatever the marketplace gravitates to. But at the same time, there have been some pushback at times that you are the main player in the marketplace and the only one to really set the stage or be the one that currency deals are struck on. So I'm just wondering if there's any discussion in your current dealings with clients that maybe that paradigm may shift and they will look to diversify and not have just one currency going forward.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","The history in these businesses, not only in the U.S. but generally around the world is there's one currency. And I don't see anything unfolding in the U.S. market right now that suggests anything different than that. That's the most efficient thing for the marketplace and for all the players on both sides of the table. We measure the consumer, we measure the consumer across all the different screens, all the different platforms, all the different ways that they consume content, and that's been our strategy and will continue to be our strategy here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Northland Capital Markets.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on the Buy segment, both revenue and profitability. Just looking at the consistent constant currency revenue declines that you've seen in info services, I'm just wondering is -- what the likelihood may be that this trend results in a down year-over-year for the full year. And then I'm curious. I know you talk about Walmart and Europe sort of contributing to the weakness there, but I'm also curious how you would characterize the discretionary nature of client spend on your retail sales measurement solutions. And are you seeing, for instance, clients pare back on sort of your tiered offerings? And would that have any sort of consistency with the results that you're seeing?","Brian J. West","I'll take a [ph] shot that one. So info for the quarter was up 1%, and as I pointed out and as you made mention of, you had some Western European pressure that we expected. You did have the year-over-year comp impact of Walmart. This was as expected. What happened at the end of the year, clients' budgets got tighter. They bought fewer off-the-shelf data sets, and there was some of that rolling around in the numbers. But what I'd tell you is that we don't see this as a trend that this is going to go down. As of the end of the year, we're confident that our business platform is solid. And when you add in clients like Mars, which will be a win that we'll feel in 2014, we feel great about our information business. So from time to time, it might have a little bit of a trend here like you mentioned. But I don't see it going down, and I see the opposite because I see our big clients wanting to lean into it more and more.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on this profitability side of the Buy segment. Was the 5% EBITDA decline expected specifically where the incremental investments that you mentioned that contributed to the decline, were those contemplated pre-quarter? Or were those intra-quarter decisions?","Brian J. West","Yes. So we knew that we wanted to go faster in Africa and faster in Mexico because the opportunities are just that compelling for us over the long term. And you've got, as I mentioned, you got getting ready to bring on a big global client like Mars, and that requires upfront investments ahead of the revenue. So all that plays into the numbers. Yes, there is a little bit of mix shift but -- that you can't control. It'll work its way out. But for us, we feel very good about where we're at in our Buy business. And over time, that business will scale, and our investment strategy will be pretty consistent. So we like what we see.","Mark J. Zgutowicz - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Just one follow-up to that then, is -- do you expect to see EBITDA growth in the Buy segment in '14?","Brian J. West","Look, we're going to see EBITDA growth in the total company, and it's going to be tied towards our ability to accelerate investment to the developing world, which is going to hit the Buy side. So when we do that, yes, the Buy margins might be suppressed deliberately because of long-term strategies. We love that. We love that because that means that we found new areas to go invest in. So we're perfectly comfortable with that. Over time, the scale of the model will show itself, and what that means in 2014 or a particular year, can't tell you. It'll really depend upon our appetite to invest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur from Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","[Audio Gap]","questions have been covered. Brian, is it fair to say that Arbitron added about $134 million in revenues in the quarter? And if so, that looks a little bit better than I would have thought.","Brian J. West","Doug, that sounds about right. We are excited about bringing Audio in for a full quarter. Obviously, it's all in through our numbers for our guidance, and I think, for us, what will be better is when we can start to show progress on these growth fronts, which too soon to tell, not counting on it, but I tell you, our teams around the world are just chomping at the bit to try to go figure out how we could put some growth accelerants. Stay tuned. Nothing to communicate other than we like what's in front of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Question. Just wanted to touch on the comScore-Google news. I'm curious to hear your thoughts from a products perspective about whether or not real-time measurement is important. That was sort of one of the things that they were trumpeting, and I know that your turnaround on OCR is next day, which currently trumps what comScore can do. But just curious if TV buyers can't reconcile their TV buys anyways for days or weeks, how important it is? Relatedly then, I'm curious about your relationship with other video ad servers. As we all know, I think, Google is not the dominant player among the video ad servicing market. And interrelated to that is -- can you update us on status on tablet measurement because I guess that's the one screen that maybe comScore has a bit of an advantage on at this point in time?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, let me start with the last one. We -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, using our OCR capability, we have been out in the market for months now in the pilot and testing phase with mobile video measurement, and that's for tablets. But also for smartphones, we've gotten very good client feedback on that. We feel great about how that's gone, and we're well on track for a broad market implementation before the new fall TV season later on this year. So we're in incredibly good position there. Not only are we able to measure all of the mobile devices, but we're going to do it in such a way that allows that viewing to be incorporated into the currency for the marketplace. That's a really big deal, a really big deal. Going to your other -- your first question about real time. The broad market -- we see the broad market, in fact we see the practice of marketing just shifting in that direction. It will happen gradually over time. Most marketers in most industries aren't there yet, and they probably won't be there any time soon. But we do see a general shift in that direction. And so it's important for our business and our company to rethink and adapt our portfolio to be in sync with that shift in what we see in terms of our marketing performs. And so we've been on that one for a long time. You already see a lot of our portfolio aligned with that, and we'll keep our strategy focused on being in sync with the marketplace as it shifts more real time. We're able to do it, but there's no point in doing it if your clients aren't ready for it because you can't be out of sync with them.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Maybe the last point was, to what degree do you think it's important to have sort of deeper relationships with video ad servers versus allowing -- and right now the same solution, it sounds like comScore and Google are offering, an agency can do by themselves right now. But sounds like this automates the process. Is that important? Is it not important? What are your thoughts on that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","We have great relationships with a lot of the video ad servers, the ad exchanges, the RTB capabilities that are out there in the marketplace. And again, our OCR metric, once again, plays a very important role in terms of us being able to serve them in their businesses. And so we feel great about where we are there, and we'll continue to develop those relationships and help them with their businesses.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Aaron Watts from Deutsche Bank.","Aaron Watts - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe just one quick one on the capital structure for Brian. You talked about how you've done a great job chopping down your cost of capital, extending out maturities. The one thing that kind of stands out to me is you have a few billion of term loan debt that comes due in a couple of years. Just curious how you're thinking about that and the timing of extending that out and if there's any mitigating factors. I don't know if you're thinking about your ratings. Curious your thoughts there.","Brian J. West","So look, we view, first of all, our access to capital markets in good times and not so good times has never been questioned, so we feel very good about access. I think the debt markets understand the credit. In terms of what's ahead of us, for sure there are 2 components. There is making sure that we could continue to de-risk and extend the 2016 70 maturities. I'm not compelled that -- too anxious, it's going to happen and evolve over time. And we're not going to try to call a moment in the market, but we do think a lot about what the framework looks like to take that and extend it. And then secondly, more near term is we have $1.1 billion of what I'll now call our new high coupon notes, 7 3\/4 notes that are callable in the fall, and we're just -- can't wait to get a hold of that because that will create accretion for the company. So I think, for us, we're very confident. We like the access. And over time, you're going to see us continue to have a very deliberate strategy to de-risk this balance sheet for sure. So stay tuned.","Operator","As there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks, everybody, for tuning in today.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2016 Nielsen Holdings PLC Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Mrs. Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Christa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial performance. Joining me on today's call is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer, and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A slide presentation that we'll use on this call is available under the Events section of our Investor Relations website.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations, and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, February 9, 2017.","We will be discussing non-GAAP measures during this call, for which we have provided reconciliations in the appendices of today's presentation and will be posted on our website. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties.

Feel free to join the queue again and if time remains, we will call on you.","And now to start the call I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everyone. Overall, at a total company level 2016 was a challenging year. We've responded by sharpening our focus on the key strategic initiatives that will drive us forward. And we continue to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations.","At the segment level it was a mix of significant progress and challenges. In our Watch segment, in response to ongoing fragmentation in the market, our teams have executed extraordinarily well on our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. The Total Audience System is perfectly aligned with what the market needs, independent, comparable, and de-duplicated measurement across all platforms. And only Nielsen can do this.","In the Buy segment we're also seeing fragmentation. New channels of distribution are growing fast. Consumers are allocating purchases across a wider variety of choices with the growing portion going to local and specialty products. For our largest clients, primarily in the U.S., these marketplace trends are especially challenging. And while that creates near-term pressure on the business, it also creates opportunity as we respond to meet our clients' changing needs.","Our investment in the Connected System does exactly that. Connecting measurement with analytics in one integrated system that brings speed and efficiency for our clients, while converting more of our business to the subscription model we favor. The Connected System is our number one priority in 2017. We know what our clients need, and we're focused on delivering it, just as we've done in Watch with Total Audience Measurement.","Let's take a quick look at the full year financials for 2016. Total company revenue grew 4.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.2% constant currency, due to ongoing productivity initiatives and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives.","GAAP earnings per share were $1.39, compared with $1.54 in the prior year. Free cash flow was a record $941 million, exceeding our guidance. Jamere will provide more color on the drivers behind this. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to both invest in our growth initiatives and return cash to our shareholders. And we'll continue with our balanced capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder value in 2017.","Acquisitions remain an integral part of our balanced capital allocation strategy. And you've seen us make a number of tuck-in acquisitions over the past few years, including eXelate, Pointlogic, Repucom, and most recently, Gracenote. Each one of these bolsters some key part of our strategy. Collectively, they accelerate our progress and make us a stronger, faster growing company, better positioned for the future. Lastly, we're updating our guidance for 2017. And Jamere will provide additional details in a few minutes.","Before we talk about the segments, let me say a few words about Gracenote, which we closed last week. Gracenote's business, which is based on its vast library of metadata related to video, audio, and sports, is a great business on a standalone basis. But on top of that it's also highly complementary to our existing audience measurement products. Its Gracenote ID will help us link content across platforms, reducing the complexity of connecting datasets at scale across TV and digital. This will only grow in importance over time as viewing fragmentation continues.","We'll also look to leverage Gracenote's footprint in over 75 million car infotainment systems, along with its automatic content recognition, or ACR, technology to help expand our measurement of in car listening, including digital. A version of this same ACR technology is also embedded in over 20 million smart TVs. And this creates a potential alternative to set-top box data for our TV measurement in the future.","So again it's a great business on a standalone basis. But when connected with our existing measurement products, multiple opportunities for upside. We look forward to updating you on future calls.","So let's take a look at the segments. First, Watch, quick look at the numbers. Segment revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 6.2%, including a 9% increase in audience measurement of video and text.","As you know our number one priority in this segment has been Total Audience Measurement. Given the ongoing public discussions, I want to spend a few minutes to remind everyone what Total Audience Measurement is, how our clients use the various components, and what to expect as we head into the 2017 upfront season.","To take a step back Total Audience [Measurement] is a system with several components, which work together and on a standalone basis. It provides comparable measurement of audiences for both content and ads across platforms, traditional and digital, for both linear and dynamic ad models.","For ads the components of Total Audience are the C3\/C7 TV ratings, digital ad ratings, and total ad ratings, as well as the newly MRC accredited Digital in TV ratings, which expands the current C3\/C7 ratings to include the eligible exposures on all digital devices.","For content the Total Audience components include TV program ratings, digital content ratings, video-on-demand measurement, connected device measurement, and Total Content Ratings. We've seen broad adoption and use of all of our offerings.","Next I'll run through our progress on each of the key components. And let me start with Total Content Ratings. As you may have seen, we've shifted our plan to a limited commercial release starting March 1. Media clients that are ready to use their own Total Content Ratings data externally to help them tell their own Total Audience stories in the upfront process \u2013 they'll be able to do so. For example, CBS, one of our lead clients, has confirmed that they'll be using Total Content Ratings beginning March 1 to quantify total viewing of CBS programs as well as to highlight the strength of the television medium.","Our goal has always been to find a solution that works for all of our media clients. And we've done that. Today, client enablement of Content Ratings spans more than 100 media brands across TV, digital video, and text.","Next is Digital Content Ratings. This feeds into Total Content Ratings, but it's also an important product on a standalone basis, measuring the complete digital landscape, including static or text content.","Digital Content Ratings were syndicated in September 2016. And adoption continues to grow among both media owners and agencies. We're also working with Facebook to use Digital Content Ratings to measure partner content distributed on their platform. And we're on track for a production launch later this quarter.","We also see \u2013 we also continue to advance our measurement capabilities for subscription video on demand. We currently have more than 20,000 episodes in our reference library. Upcoming improvements include more automation, improved data capture, and expanded reporting.","On the ad side, Digital Ad Ratings, another key component of our Total Audience system, continues to grow as the standard for digital video ad guarantees. We see solid growth in the number of mobile impressions and campaigns we measure. Last month, Snapchat announced that they will offer guarantees to advertisers based on Digital Ad Ratings. Advertisers have had the option of buying Facebook ads like this since 2015.","This is important because advertisers are becoming more demanding. If you heard or read the remarks from Procter & Gamble CMO, Marc Pritchard, at the Interactive Advertising Bureau last week, his remarks leave no room for doubt that third-party independent comparable cross platform measurement is critical for advertisers.","For Total Ad Ratings, adoption continues to grow with key advertisers using the measurement across their campaigns to understand the incremental reach of television and digital. And I can't leave this section without adding that our flagship national TV measurement remains as strong as ever in the marketplace, bolstered by the expansion of capabilities from our Total Audience Measurement system.","We're excited about the April launch of our National [TV] Out-of-Home Measurement Service, which adds coverage of viewing in bars, airports, hotels, and beyond. With the 2017 up-fronts rapidly approaching, our Total Audience system and its many components will play a big role, helping our clients to prepare for and negotiate deals.","And while there's always more to do, we feel great about where we are today. Nielsen C3 and C7 measurement remains the primary basis on which advertising in TV content trades. At the same time our clients continue to debate how best to make the definition of the currency broader and more flexible with respect to ad loads.","Today, we're already delivering on the need to extend the C3\/C7 currency to digital platforms through our newly MRC-accredited Digital in TV Ratings service. We will continue to work closely with the industry. And we stand ready to deliver on any new requirements on which they agree to credit additional ad exposures to the currency. We remain confident that only Nielsen is positioned to do this. And our Total Audience Measurement system will underpin the currency as it continues to evolve.","Let's turn to local TV. We're making good progress on our plan to incorporate out-of-home viewing in the ratings later this year. Similarly, we're making good progress on our work to incorporate set-top-box data from DISH and Charter into our measurement. And also last month we announced the multi-year agreement with AT&T to incorporate their anonymized set-top-box data into Nielsen's national in-TV ratings.","In Audio, we announced a 10% increase in the Portable People Meter sample size across 48 markets starting in mid-2017. Larger sample sizes are important due to the continuing fragmentation of audiences and the need for more granular analysis of the data. This expansion will ultimately contribute to a stronger radio advertising market.","In Marketing Effectiveness, constant currency revenues grew just over 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year. We expect solid double-digit growth to continue in 2017 on what has grown to be a sizable part of our business.","As a reminder, this is where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets, helping advertisers improve their return on investment. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud serves as the backbone, providing clients with faster, more efficient access to data and analytics.","Let's turn to Buy. Segment revenues grew nearly 1% in the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis, led by 7% growth in emerging markets. In developed markets, revenues increased modestly. Earlier, I mentioned the pressure we're seeing in our U.S. Buy business. But I think it's worth spending a few more minutes on the environment in which we're operating. As we've discussed, our fast-moving consumer goods clients are under pressure in their developed markets. And this is most acute in the U.S. market, where our large global clients are reining in costs in the face of challenging top-line growth.","While our data remains as mission critical as ever and is embedded in our clients' workflows, our business isn't immune. Our contract renewal rates remain high. In fact they're 100% with our largest global clients. But we're feeling pressure from reduced client spend. And this was reflected in our 2016 results. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day in December, we're planning for a continuation of this tougher environment in 2017.","Our response to this is to, first, drive productivity and efficiency in our operations. Second, focus on executing on our Connected System initiative. And third, broaden our coverage in a fragmenting market. In a minute I'll go into more details on each of these initiatives.","But first, emerging markets. We have a compelling story in emerging markets. As a global company with a footprint in over 100 markets, we have a strong position in the markets that are growing the fastest. This is a significant competitive advantage. Our balanced portfolio of global and local clients, ongoing investments in better coverage and granularity for our measurement products, and the healthy demand for our broad range of analytics offerings will continue to drive growth in this part of our business, which accounts for nearly one-third of our total Buy revenues.","Okay. So how do we navigate through what we often describe as a two-speed world? Let's take a look at our strategic initiatives.","First, Connected System. And I think it's worth repeating that the Connected System is our number one priority for 2017. While we still expect this to be a transition year, the Connected System will ultimately lead to a stronger, higher margin business.","Our clients' two main needs are speed and efficiency. Connected System will deliver on both fronts by systematically connecting our measurement data with the everyday analytics our clients use to run their business. By providing them as one integrated platform based system, we'll deliver more value to our clients and in the process convert more of our revenues to a subscription model.","We continue to work closely with our Connected System's charter clients, who played an integral role in helping us design the system. We have an aggressive plan to push new capabilities and modules to our charter clients throughout the year, while also expanding to an additional 20 clients to 30 clients as the year unfolds, preparing for a broader rollout as we head into 2018.","One key aspect of our Connected System is our Connected Partner Program. As a reminder, connected partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps to run on our Connected System's open platform, helping to address a wider range of use cases and thereby helping our clients realize more value from our measurement data.","From the initial launch last October, the number of connected partners has grown to 18, with recent growth driven by analytics firms focused on the needs of retailers. The apps in this open ecosystem help to connect data, internal teams, and outside vendors for our clients, many of whom are already using these apps to help them in various parts of their operations. We're excited about the value this program brings to our Connected System initiative.","Next, we continue to make good progress on our coverage of e-commerce, both in developed and emerging markets. In the U.S. we built a cross-platform solution to connect, harmonize, project, and calibrate several different sources of data. It's complex process. But with our data science and data integration capabilities, it's the kind of thing at which Nielsen excels.","Today we cover about 90% of U.S. e-commerce sales for fast-moving consumer goods. Our next step will be to add more granularity to the data. As we exited the year, we delivered e-commerce measurement to pilot clients, both manufacturers and retailers. And we're on track to push out more functionality in April and again later in the year.","In January we entered into a strategic agreement with JD.com, one of China's largest and fastest growing e-commerce retailers. Our partnership with JD.com creates a powerful resource for brands and marketers in China, giving them an accurate read of the market, including a more detailed picture of sales volume, pricing, merchandizing, and promotion.","E-commerce sales are growing globally, but China is ahead of the curve. So it's crucial that we keep pace in that important market.","Including China and the U.S., our e-commerce measurement is up and running in 11 markets with plans to expand to six more in 2017. This investment is the most visible expression of our commitment to total consumer coverage, which is as important as ever, given the fragmentation occurring in the fast-moving consumer goods market.","Finally, as we discussed at our Analyst Day in December, we're taking action to realign our product portfolio. At the end of 2016 we exited a consumer segmentation business and some of our custom survey research services, both in the U.S. These moves enable us to shift more focus and resources to our core business priorities. Beyond these moves, our teams are driving productivity initiatives and fighting the ongoing fight to align costs with revenues, especially in our U.S. Buy business.","I'll wrap up my prepared remarks by reiterating three points I shared at our December Analyst Day. Number one, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Independent third-party measurement remains as essential as ever for clients in both Watch and Buy. Number two, we're crystal clear about where our clients want us to go next in our business. And for that reason we're highly confident in our strategy. Number three, we're proven executers. You've seen this on the Watch side of our business with Total Audience. And we're now focused on delivering a similar outcome with the Connected System in Buy.","Great strategies are only as valuable as our ability to deliver them to the marketplace. And to do that well it takes talent, team work, grit, and a leadership culture to deliver. That's what we have.","Over to you, Jamere.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thank you, Mitch. Despite a more challenging backdrop in our markets, our teams have been laser focused on execution. And those efforts are reflected in our fourth quarter results. Our full year results are also indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model.","First, let me give a few more details on our full year 2016 performance. On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Total revenue was just over $6.3 billion, up 2.2% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in our Buy segment. This was partially offset by 190 basis points of currency exchange headwind.","Net income was $502 million, and net income per share was $1.39, which was down $0.15 a share versus 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion, and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges primarily in our Buy segment and lower gains. 2015 included a $0.51 net benefit related to gains on the disposition of certain assets and the step-up of NCS.","Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis total revenue was up 4.1% constant currency, which is slightly above the high end of the revenue range we provided on our third quarter earnings call.","We also highlighted core revenue at our Analyst Day. And let me just remind you of what this means. This is revenue that excludes products and services that we are seeking to exit or are deemed non-strategic. In 2016 our core revenue grew 5.2% on an constant currency basis.","Despite a challenging environment, both our Watch and Buy segments grew in 2016. And we continue to execute on our growth initiatives.","Our Watch business grew 6.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of video and text and strong contributions from the Repucom acquisition, the Nielsen Catalina Solutions JV, and the Nielsen Marketing Cloud.","Our Buy business grew 2.3% constant currency, driven by volume and pricing gains in the emerging markets, offset by softness in developed markets, specifically the U.S.","Adjusted EBITDA was just over $1.9 billion, up 5.2% constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.7% up 31 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting our ability to deliver operating leverage as we invest in growth initiatives.","We've moved to full GAAP metrics one quarter earlier than originally planned. However, we have provided all of the pieces in our release to reconcile through our historic adjusted net income per share metric.","We generated record free cash flow of $941 million, up 16.5% versus a year ago behind our record fourth quarter performance. Our free cash flow conversion of adjusted EBITDA was 49%, up 6 points versus a year ago. Our results were better than expected, driven by improved working capital management and CapEx timing on our growth initiatives. And as I said in December free cash flow conversion is a key operating metric for us. And we're driving it with intensity.","And finally, this record free cash flow performance enabled us to deliver of over $850 million back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2016. We remain committed to a free cash flow profile that enables us to grow our business and drive incremental shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategies.","Moving to the fourth quarter. On the left side of the page our results on an U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.7 billion, up 2% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in Buy, partially offset by 140 basis points of currency headwind.","Net income was $159 million. And net income per share was $0.44. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion, and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges related to our Buy segment and lower gains versus the fourth quarter of 2015.","Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis total revenue was up 3.4% constant currency. Our core revenue grew 4.7% constant currency in the fourth quarter. And I'll provide a little bit more color on the segments in just a few moments.","Adjusted EBITDA was $548 million, up 3.8% constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.1%, up 13 basis points on a constant currency basis. In the quarter we continued to drive price and productivity to fund investments that will deliver top-line growth in 2017 and beyond.","Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $476 million, which was up 55.6% versus 2015. Our incredibly strong free cash flow performance is indicative of the continued commitment we have to drive cash, fuel growth, and return cash to our shareholders.","Next I'll move to the segments. First on our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $788 million, up 6.2% constant currency. Audience Measurement of video and text was up 9% in the quarter, helped by the Repucom acquisition and continued momentum in our Total Audience initiatives. Excluding the Repucom acquisition, Audience Measurement of video and text grew 6.5% constant currency, led by strength in national TV and digitals.","Digital Ad Ratings continued its momentum with a 31% increase in campaigns in the fourth quarter. And Digital Content Ratings is gaining traction, as we had a number of Q4 wins, including with some of our largest media clients.","Audio was down 1.6% in the quarter. However, the business was nearly flat in 2016, while generating outstanding margins and strong free cash flow.","Marketing Effectiveness was up 9.2%. And I want to point out that we lapped the NCS step-up in 4Q, hence the growth rate is sequentially lower. In 2016 Marketing Effectiveness was up 16.2%, as we made key investments in the Nielsen Marketing Cloud and Nielsen Catalina Solutions. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud volume grew double digits in 2016, which has played a key role in helping advertisers measure their return on investments.","As expected, we had nearly a 1 point drag on Watch revenue from the products in our Other Watch bucket, due to the divestiture of the NRG business in 4Q 2015.","Watch adjusted EBITDA was $363 million, up 6.8% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 25 basis points on a constant currency basis, as we continue to drive operating leverage while we invest in the business. Our Watch business has tremendous momentum heading into 2017. And importantly the investments that we made to add capability to the portfolio are delivering growth.","Turning to Buy. We certainly guided for a tough environment in the fourth quarter, and indeed it was. However, our results were better than expected. Fourth quarter total Buy revenue was $868 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis. Core Buy revenue grew 2.6% constant currency.","Our business in the developed markets was $545 million, up 40 basis points on a constant currency basis behind relative strength in Europe and continued softness in the U.S.","Our business in the emerging markets was $283 million, up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are executing against a tough backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions and still delivering growth. We saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets with solid growth in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Greater China. Emerging market revenue grew 8.6% in 2016, in line with our expectations.","Our efforts to prune the Buy portfolio are well underway, as we announced the disposition of our U.S. consumer segmentation business. And we exited a portion of our U.S. custom survey research services at the end of the fourth quarter. And we'll continue to pursue actions on this front in 2017.","Buy EBITDA was $193 million, down 1% constant currency in the fourth quarter. We are continuing to invest in our Connected System, reshaping the portfolio and restructuring the segment to improve growth and profitability.","Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses simply on the translation impact for reporting purposes.","In the quarter foreign currency resulted in a 140 basis points drag on revenue and a 60 basis points drag on EBITDA, which represented about $0.01 a share earnings headwind versus our December Analyst Day. If yesterday's spot rates held constant in 2017, we expect a 70 basis points drag on revenue and a 10 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2017.","Moving to guidance. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect the Gracenote acquisition in our Watch segment and the exit from some custom survey research services in Buy. We now expect total company revenue growth to be 5% to 6%. And we are maintaining our 2017 EPS guidance. There is no change to our original underlying core growth forecast. However, Gracenote helped boost core revenue growth to 6.5% to 7.5%.","Given the mix impact of Gracenote on total company margins, we're now guiding to flat margins for 2017. We're also raising our free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million. And we're updating our interest expense, D&A, and share count guidance on the right side of the page.","So to wrap up. Our execution in the fourth quarter was better than planned. Our Watch business continued to have great momentum. And we are aggressively taking steps to improve top line results and margins in Buy. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure that enabled us to grow and return over $850 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks.","And with that I'll turn it back to Sara.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. Thank you. Christa, we're ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. Good morning, everybody. I hope you're surviving the snowstorm here in the Northeast.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hey, Todd.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'd like to direct my one \u2013 hi. I'm going to try and follow the rules here with one question, I guess in a couple dimensions, all reference free cash flow. So I guess for Jamere, so just in the quarter, or the close out of fiscal 2016, clearly the free cash flow you delivered was a lot higher than where you had taken the guidance down to, so as the year was closing out. So just wondered what happened and changed to the better in between the time you lowered your guidance and delivered the cash flow?","And then the second part would be just sort of saying on the same thing, looking at 2017 and just comparing your guidance to sort of the long-term framework. I think your long-term framework talks about sort of mid-single revenue growth that flows through to I think it's double-digit free cash flow growth. In 2017 guidance we have the high end of high single revenue growth, but we actually have I guess a free cash flow slight decline compared to where we ended this year. So if you could just walk us through the different buckets of 2017? And why the free cash flow conversion relative to the framework is lower than your normal framework? And maybe help have some confidence for us of why those sort of one timers and exceptions to the normal framework? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. Thanks, Todd. So in terms of our guidance, we guided to $850 million for the year. And we actually came in a lot stronger than that. There were two buckets of that. First was working capital was actually better by about $60 million. And I'll give all the credits to our team there. They did a tremendous job of sort of managing working capital and collections in the back half of the year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Let me just add, our teams in both Watch and the Buy side of our business, a tremendous effort in the fourth quarter.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. And the key here is again, we don't have inventory. So the working capital game for us is really about making sure that we manage the collections process, which our teams did a tremendous job in the fourth quarter. So we're very pleased with the performance there.","And then the remainder of that is just timing of CapEx. And if you look in our release, you'll see that our CapEx for next year is actually a lot higher than what we've run historically. So you've got a little bit of timing over the two fiscal years.","In terms of our long-term framework, what we said at Analyst Day is that our free cash flow conversion is going to be 45% to 50% of our adjusted EBITDA. And barring anything in terms of spikes in investments and those sorts of things, we're going to be in that ZIP Code. As you saw this year, we finished at about 49%. And the $900 million gets us in that ZIP Code for next year. And that's the way you ought to be thinking about our free cash flow conversion going forward.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Christa, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on your Connected System and some thoughts there. What do you think is the biggest hurdle to faster client adoption there? Is it more predicated on having your capabilities and modules gain some more scale or maturity? Is it somewhat predicated on your push efforts and client awareness? Or is something like the increasing participation of the Connected Partners you called out something that you need to drive better adoption? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hey, thanks for the question, Anj. I think adoption of the Connected System will hinge primarily on our clients' ability to implement it. Just don't forget, what we're doing here with the Connected System is we're taking existing solutions, our measurement product and our everyday analytics products that most of our clients are already using in their business, and we're connecting them in one integrated system.","And then they're deploying that differently inside their business. And it's that different type of deployment inside of their business that will drive speed and efficiency for our clients as well as more efficiency for Nielsen. So it's that change process from our clients side that will be the biggest governor on the speed at which they'll be able to deploy and that we'll be able to continue to roll it out.","We're onboard with our charter clients now. We have no shortage of demand from clients who want to be in that next wave. So we're very pleased about the broad and strong enthusiasm we're seeing from our manufacturer clients in the U.S. And it's really about managing that demand. And it's a great problem to have, really to have such strong demand and having to manage that and make sure that we can deliver on what the expectations of those clients are.","As far as the role that Connected Partner program and the apps they provide, in terms of that governing the speed of the rollout, no, not really so much. And also the \u2013 I think the reason for that is primarily just the design of the system, designed to be scalable. And so we'll be able to deploy those apps as quickly as they become available from our partners. And our clients in fact \u2013 well, let me just add. Our clients are already taking advantage of some of those apps even before Connected System in a full form is deployed for them.","But ultimately the demand is going to be strong from our clients, because of the speed and efficiency that the Connected System is designed to deliver. And as we said in our opening comments about the tougher environment many of our largest clients are operating in, especially in developed markets, in particular the U.S., everybody is looking for more efficiency right now. And so we're certainly on point with regard to that need from our clients.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Hi, Toni.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You recently delayed the large scale rollout of Total Content Ratings. So just wondering how you're thinking about the financial impact of the delay, if any?","And also you previously mentioned you expected clients would be using your digital metrics in the upfronts this spring. And so just given the delay, would you expect that guarantees based off of your metrics would be less likely in this season? And basically when do you \u2013 if so, when do you think that your metrics will be used for guarantees in digital on more of a widespread basis? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Toni. Yeah. Oh yeah. We did adjust the rollout schedule for Total Content Ratings. And we did that based on the feedback from our clients, which we always appreciate. One thing that was abundantly clear from the feedback from our clients is just how important they see Total Audience and how important they see this latest component of Total Audience \u2013 Total Content Ratings to be for them.","They also were very clear about wanting us to move forward. They see this as an important addition and something that's going to help them in their business. However, some of them asked us to go slower. We were going fast. They asked us to go a little slower.","The measurement itself though is solid. It's working as intended. But the reason why some of those clients wanted us to go a little slower is because to take advantage of it, they need to be ready. That means they need to implement the SDK in their apps. They need to make sure they understand what the data means for their business. And so some clients just needed more time. And we respect that.","So the clients who are ready to move forward, they're going to be able to do so. The clients who need more time, we found a solution in our approach that will give them more time. And that's where we are in terms of the timeline.","With respect to financial impact, we don't really expect there to be any significant financial impact at all.","And then you also asked, Toni, about the effect on the upfront, in terms of the ability to offer guarantees and how Total Audience will play in the upfront. We're confident that the various components of our Total Audience system will play very important roles for our clients across the board in terms of how they prepare for and proceed through the upfront process.","And with regard to guarantees specifically, let's remember that Total Content Ratings is a content metric. Guarantees are all about advertising metrics. So the C3\/C7 currency metric is a measure of audiences for advertising. Digital Ad Ratings is a measure of audiences for advertising. Total Ad Ratings the same way.","Whereas Total Content Ratings is not involved in the currency. It's more involved in how people plan and more involved in the analytics that help our clients think about the marketplace. So you won't really see any impact with respect to Total Content Ratings on use of the currency in the upfronts. And currency discussion as I mentioned in my opening comments, C3\/C7 will continue to underpin advertising in TV content. With the addition of this Digital in TV Ratings that we've just made available in a newly MRC accredited form for the market, allowing us to expand that definition of the currency. So I think we're in very good shape on that front. Thanks, Toni.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Cary with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Jamere, I believe at the Analyst Day you called out expectations that growth in Audience Measurement on an organic basis would be pretty similar year over year. So first, is that still generally the case? And as we look at the 8.3% constant currency growth in 2016, can you call out what of that was organic? And what your assumptions are for inorganic contribution in Audience Measurement in 2017?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks. So the expectations in terms of the organic growth have not changed. The only thing that you will see is that we will include Gracenote in the Watch segment. And the lion's share of that revenue will probably fall in the Audience Measurement, once we break down the pieces.","In terms of this year, if you look at our Watch business overall, our Watch business grew about 6.3% year-to-date for 2016. We had about 2 points of inorganic included in that. So that was the difference in the numbers if you look at where we grew in total and where we are next year.","We also didn't include any additional tuck-ins into next year. So when we gave guidance at Analyst Day, the only acquisitions that we had rolling through numbers were Repucom. So pretty clean from an organic standpoint when you look at what we gave at December Analyst Day and what we're expecting now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Jamere, just on the margins being flat for 2017. Is that all just the mix in of Gracenote? And are you able to quantify at all the strategic investment you're making in Buy, developed this year?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So the mix impact, Andrew, is all Gracenote. So if you look at the margin rates of Gracenote and you mix that into our revenue, you mix down from a margin rate standpoint. So that's the driver behind going to flat margins for 2017.","In terms of the strategic impact of Gracenote, I'll start and then I'll talk a little \u2013 I'll turn it to Mitch to talk a little bit more of it. There are a couple things that we're thinking about as it relates to Gracenote. Number one, we're going to go aggressive on the integration in the business. We're going to move this into our Watch segment.","Obviously today, we use some of those Gracenote services as part of what we do in Audience Measurement. So there'll be some synergies there that we'll start to realize late in the year. And most of that will show up in 2018.","And we actually like adding that to the portfolio for a number of reasons, many of which Mitch highlighted earlier. And I think the big piece of it for us, as we think about it going forward, is the upside associated with the ACR technology that has the potential to provide some pretty significant efficiencies in Gracenote.","In terms of the Buy, developed investments, those investments are primarily around the Connected Buy System. And if you look at our spending on that from a margin standpoint, obviously we manage margins on a total company basis. We're going to invest with discipline in the Connected System going into next year. But we expect to deliver flat margins on a total company basis, just based on the productivity initiatives that we're working inside the company.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Marc Pritchard from Procter & Gamble made some comments that I'm sure you all heard a couple weeks ago, which specifically \u2013 specific for you guys, made call for always using third-party MRC accredited measurement tools. And while he was talking in one context probably about Facebook and some of the metrics they're providing, I think the broader point that was made I think \u2013 I get the impression it resonated with a lot of people in the industry, who maybe weren't using a lot of your MRC accredited tools for \u2013 with other media owners. So I was curious. Have you seen any uptick in conversations or calls from marketers looking at using your tools in places with digital media owners, where maybe they weren't using DAR or anything, that followed from that presentation?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah, thanks, Brian. It's just been about a week and a half I guess since Marc gave that talk at the Interactive Advertising Bureau. And there's been a lot of discussion. I've seen a lot of coverage of it in the industry press. And it continues to reverberate around the industry.","I think what he said was what everybody at some level already knew to be true. But maybe just weren't fully stepping out and acting on it yet. And still probably a little too early for us to say we're seeing a meaningful and significant uptick in demand. But I fully expect it with a strong and credible voice from one of the U.S. \u2013 in fact one of the world's largest advertisers stepping out, making those kinds of statements. We're going to see a lot of other people follow that lead.","And I already have heard from a few other clients, who said that they're really grateful and appreciative of the fact that he did show that leadership. They just couldn't agree more. So that's what we're seeing and hearing right now in terms of it showing up in our business. Yeah, it's just a week and a half, a little too early to say.","But I think it'll be a healthy thing for the industry. I think it's also just to be expected. With digital advertising, before it was whitespaced. And a lot of people were just going out there and putting their money into that whitespace. And now it's reflective of the maturing market that digital advertising is, where people are going to look for more accountability. And advertisers are going to be more demanding about that accountability.","And the kind of tools that we offer with Digital Ad Ratings, third-party independent measurement, and the kind of tools that some of our partners offer with verification with \u2013 on things like viewability with the three partners we work with. I think those kinds of products in the marketplace are well positioned, given the trend.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to Connected System and a couple part question here if I could. First, I just want to confirm that again we're kind of tracking towards I think what you guys have characterized as a full agile launch in 2018. I just want to make sure that still is the timeframe.","Also as we've gotten a little bit further into this, I wanted to maybe pick your brain a little bit on how you were thinking about revenue versus margin impact as we get into the out years here? I think the obvious thought is, we should see some margin expansion. But the revenue impact, maybe muted, maybe even down a little bit. So I guess any incremental color on that would be helpful as well.","And then finally, with the app partner program. Just curious if you are already kind of taking a commission or a take rate on those third-party app sales? Any color there would be very helpful. Thank you.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Matthew. We are on track with our development as we've most recently communicated before this call at our December Analyst Day with the charter clients on track to bring on board the 20 to 30 additional clients as the year progresses. And then leading to a broad \u2013 I won't call it a full rollout, but I'd call it a broader rollout as we head in to 2018, because there will always be more work to do on a system, a platform-based system like this. And that's a good thing, by the way. Opportunity abounds with the way this system is designed.","In terms of revenue versus margin impact. Margin has always been the first thing that we've mentioned in terms of the financial impact of Connected System, as it sees a more full and broader rollout, because of the efficiency that it really delivers both to Nielsen and to our clients.","There will also be revenue impact. And we think that the positive revenue impact as it develops and grows over time will largely be in the smaller client segment, the long tail of the marketplace if you will. Where right now the way our services are currently delivered, the minimum access cost if you will to come into our services, it's just still a little too high from many of those smaller companies that are out in the market. By the way, many of these smaller companies who are performing relatively well right now. So the Connected System lowers that access cost. And that offers us an important growth opportunity with the long-tailed, smaller clients.","In terms of the app partners and the way we're monetizing that relationship. Yeah. Think of it as rev share. I think that's the right way to think about it. And that will be good, meaningful over time.","But for me the bigger contribution from those apps isn't the revenue share that we'll get from the apps themselves. It's much more about the role those apps will play amplifying the underlying value of our core measurement data, which is where most of the value in our business resides. So the more we can help our clients extract that value out of our core measurement data, realize that value \u2013 and the apps will do exactly that \u2013 that's where you're going to see the bigger impact on our business from those apps.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Manav Penday (sic) [Patnaik], with Barclays. Your line is open please.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Jamere, I was hoping you could just walk us through the true organic growth number by each division, Buy and Watch? And then maybe on marketing effectiveness too? And the only question I had really was on the emerging market Buy business, the 7% growth. That's their third quarter of deceleration. So just curious what's going on there? Is that just timing? That's just how things work, in terms of your 8% to 10% targets next year?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks. So on a total company basis, if you look at the net of acquisitions and dispositions, we're at about 2.5% organic, so 3.4% constant currency, 2.5% organic. That is all in Watch. So if we look at the Watch business, we see 6.2%. That translated to about 4.4% organic and that's the net impact of Repucom and NRG.","In terms of the emerging markets and the deceleration. Listen, a couple million dollars in a quarter can swing the emerging markets by a point or two. We feel pretty good about where we exited the year at 8.6% growth for the total year, which is right in line with our forecast. And we have good momentum going into next year, based on the broad-based growth that we see in the markets that we talked about.","So no concerns there in terms of a deceleration. Right in line with where we expect to finish for the year. And good momentum heading into next year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","And you've seen that over time, Manav, in our business with emerging markets. They don't necessarily move in lock step with GDP growth rates in those markets, simply because we still have a lot more opportunity to increase our penetration of our various services in those markets. So that's why I think we've generally been able to outperform the growth rates at a GDP level in our business in most of those markets.","We did see a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter in India. You probably heard about it from some other clients too with cash, not a big one, but instead of India being the double-digit grower that we've started to see more recently, it was more in the mid-singles. But look, we're still \u2013 we still feel great about emerging markets part of our business heading into 2017.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kip Paulson with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Kip Paulson - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. Audience Measurement of video and text has been slowly accelerating year on year in constant currency terms throughout 2016 and helped by Repucom in the fourth quarter. Given this backdrop, how should we think about the cadence of growth in the 2017 quarters? And does your 4% to 5% growth outlook for the sub-segment in 2017 have a fair amount of conservatism baked in? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Well, we have guided \u2013 originally we guided 4%, 5% for Audience Measurement. And obviously we have a lot of momentum heading into next year. And so we feel pretty good about that guidance range at this point. I wouldn't be certain about where we are in terms of the top end or the bottom end of the range at this point. But we have a lot of momentum in the \u2013 going into next year. We feel good about it.","The other thing that I'll also point out is that next year, again you're going to see Gracenote rolling through the numbers. And so you'll actually see the numbers spike up. And we'll be pretty clear about what the \u2013 sort of the underlying Audience Measurement growth is, so that you can see how the acquisitions are performing relative to our base businesses.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Well, thanks. I'd like to come back to the issue of e-commerce please. You gave an interesting number, which is that you measure 90% of some CPG sales in the U.S. I think I heard that right. Wonder if you could comment a little bit more on that? Where are you getting that from? Is this directly via those companies' websites? Or I assume it's more via online delivery services? Just curious where that comes from. And if you can give any indication of what percent of their total sales that may be?","And then similarly, I wonder if you can comment on your e-commerce efforts in places like India and China? You mentioned JD.com. I know you do a lot in India. I imagine those are just massive growth opportunities. I think you have a deal with Alibaba as well in China. So any bit more you could mention on that would be great. Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks, Tim. You did hear correctly that our current e-commerce measurement solution for our U.S. clients covers about 90% of fast moving consumer goods sales on e-commerce platforms. The opportunity we have now is to add a lot more depth to that data, so that it can be sliced and diced and analyzed in a greater number of ways. But our coverage is 90%.","Where that data is coming from is not just one data source. It actually comes from multiple data sources. So in some cases it is the dot com arms of brick and mortar retailers, sharing their data with us. In other cases we get it directly from consumers. And in other cases we get it from other partners.","So we're taking these multiple datasets, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. And then we apply Nielsen's core competency of data science and data integration capabilities to stitch together all these different data sources. And then project them out to represent e-commerce sales for the entire marketplace.","Now this is a hot area for our clients. It's still a relatively small percent of most of their sales, let's be clear about that. But it is one of the faster growing new channels that are emerging. And so you can imagine if you're a general manager inside one of these fast moving consumer goods companies, you want to make sure that where you're seeing growth in your business \u2013 because growth's difficult right now \u2013 you want to make sure that wherever you're seeing growth in your business is captured and represented in the measurement data that you're buying from Nielsen. And so, look, we get that 100%. And that's why we're so focused on e-commerce. That sets where we're going with this right now.","In terms of what we're doing in other parts of the world. You're right. In China we've been working with Alibaba in the past. JD.com is the latest step forward in terms of being able to cover e-commerce in that particular market. And we feel great about this relationship with JD.com. It's very comprehensive. We have very high coverage in that market as well. And in China there's a higher percentage of fast moving consumer goods sales that are moving through e-commerce platforms. And it's especially high in certain product categories that just so happen to be high margin. Things like cosmetic products, things like infant formula and baby diapers, and things like that.","In India we are also active. But we're not as far down the path there. That's a market, it has a lot more fragmentation. Still a huge percentage of fast-moving consumer goods volume moving through the traditional trade. Even the modern trade brick-and-mortar isn't that big in that particular market. Nonetheless, there are one or two important players in that market. Amazon's starting to become a lot more active in that market. And so it will heat up. And we're focused on it.","There are couple other markets that are really important for our clients. Korea is probably one that shows up more than some people might expect, not because it's necessarily big, but because it's so advanced. And so you can bet that we're active with e-commerce measurement in that market. And in many cases we're learning things in that market that we know will become important in other markets down the road, as they continue to evolve. And so we use our footprint in the Korea market with respect to e-com in that manner.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. So a...","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Bill. Hey, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'd like to return to the emerging markets growth duration question. So it seems like phase one was global players moving into the emerging markets. And phase two has been the rise of the local players in the emerging markets. And so I wanted to ask about phase three, if \u2013 that we're either in or approaching, what that's going to be? And your confidence on the ability to continue to do the upper single digit revenue growth?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","We still see phase two, as you described it, Bill, having a lot of legs, frankly. Don't think that one...","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","... has run its course at all. So there's good news there. And then if there \u2013 if you'd like me to try to describe a phase three, I think the way I would characterize that is, as some of those local players start to really gain scale in their home market, many of them are already starting to look to extend themselves on a regional basis or a global basis. And given the strong roles we play with them in their local markets, for example in a market like China, we're the logical partner to help them if they want to then broaden their business to other markets around the world.","And we've already seen a little bit of incremental growth in our business from that. And we positioned ourselves in terms of how we've structured our teams and our organization to capture more of that growth, as we see it continue to emerge over the next couple years.","We're not quite there yet. And we're still pretty focused on phase two, as you described it and the growth opportunity there. But that phase three, I have no doubt that that's going to eventually emerge and be fairly meaningful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Trevor Romeo - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Tim today. Just a quick one for you on leverage. So ticking up a little bit closer to 4 times on a net basis. Could you guys just give us an update on kind of where you see that \u2013 where you're comfortable with that going? And how you think about capital deployment going forward. Thanks?","Jamere Jackson - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Yeah. So no change to our long-term framework. We've said that we're going to hold leverage in the 3 times area. So the translation on that as I've often said is, you probably won't see us a with a 2 [times] handle. And you probably won't see us with a 4 [times] handle on leverage. So no change there.","And then no change in terms of how we think about our balanced capital allocation approach. So our long-term free cash flow allocation is 45% to the dividend, which we intend to grow in line with earnings. We've said we're going to toggle 40%-ish between M&A and buyback opportunities and the remainder to service the debt. And this gives us tremendous flexibility to, number one, grow our business, but also to return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. And we're going to stay with that long-term framework going forward.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. With that we'll turn it back to Mitch.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Nielsen Holdings Plc","Folks, I want to say thanks to everybody for joining the call this morning. For those of you in the Northeast for braving the snowstorm, we say travel safely to all of you. And yeah, thanks for your interest in your company \u2013 in our company and thanks for your questions.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Kate Vanek, SVP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Kate White Vanek","Thanks so much, Ian. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us this morning to discuss Nielsen\u2019s second quarter 2015 performance. Joining me on today\u2019s call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, CEO and Jamere Jackson, CFO. A slide presentation that we\u2019ll use on this call is available under the Events section of our IR portion of our website at nielsen.com\/investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen\u2019s outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen\u2019s view as of today, July 28, 2015.","Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties which we believe are material are outlined in our 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can find on our website.","For Q&A as we did the past two quarters and we\u2019ll continue it here, we ask everyone limit themselves to one question only so that we can accommodate everybody in the queue. Feel free to join the queue again and if time remains, we will call on you. And as always, you know where to find us after the call and if you have any need for any sort of follow up.","And now, to start the call, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks, Kate. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today.","We had a great quarter. We had important accomplishments across both our Watch and Buy segments. Strong financial results in the quarter reflected consistency of our business model and once again, the outstanding execution by our teams. Results also reflect that persistent value of Nielsen\u2019s independent third-party measurement in a rapidly changing complex market place. It\u2019s core of what we do and its value continues to grow as we create stronger system-level integration between our measurement services and the analytics that help drive improvement for our clients.","Let\u2019s walk through a high level look at our second quarter results. First, revenues. Constant currency revenues increased 4.8% in the quarter. Watch revenues rose 4.7%, driven by strength in Audience Measurement which was up more than 5% and Marketing Effectiveness which grew more than 20%. Buy revenues grew 4.8% constant currency, fuelled by client wins in every region of the world. Developed market revenue grew nearly 3% and emerging markets grew more than 9%.","Next, adjusted EBITDA growth was north of 7% constant currency, due to the accretive impact of our investments in measurement coverage as well as our continuous focus on productivity. Adjusted net income per share grew 14% constant currency to $0.66. Free cash flow was $154 million in the quarter, up 33%. Our progress on the working capital component was one of the key drivers here.","Our strong operating performance enables us to invest in future growth for our business and deliver value to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. During the quarter, we continued to buyback our stock under our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we\u2019re on track to fully execute by mid-2016.","Acquisitions are another key part of our balanced approach to capital allocation and we are extremely pleased with our acquisition of eXelate which we closed in March. eXelate is an incredibly powerful digital platform that links multiple datasets, proprietary data from our clients, Nielsen\u2019s industry standard datasets and other data sources to form one of the world\u2019s largest consumer databases.","Truly an amazing capability designed for today\u2019s increasingly programmatic world and it enables dynamic management of marketing effectiveness with a level of precision and efficiency not previously available, [indiscernible] clients in both our Watch and Buy segments. Last point on this slide, we are reiterating our guidance for 2015.","Next, I\u2019ll provide an update on our key strategic initiatives and comment on some of the specific highlights in the quarter. Let\u2019s begin with Watch. We continue to make steady progress towards our goal to provide our clients with Total Audience Measurement, it\u2019s clearly what the market needs and it remains our number one priority.","As a reminder, total audience measurement is our framework for comprehensive measurement, following consumers wherever they go and however the view across all screens, devices and platforms. Nielsen is uniquely positioned to deliver this complete view.","In television audience measurement, contract renewals remain rock solid and we also continue to find new entrants. A growing number of our media clients are also now supplementing their C3 and C7 ratings with our reaction-based analytics of the sales lift of their television campaigns. These analytics are complementary to our ratings. Our ratings provide the reach metrics of age, gender and geography and service the underlying calibration and verification for the reaction-based metrics to scale.","We continue to see strong interest from clients for measurement of video on demand using our new signature-based method that we launched in March. We already have a wide range of clients using this new service, including some studios who license content directly to subscription video on demand providers. We\u2019re now measuring viewing of nearly a 1000 shows, covering nearly 3000 episodes. So as you can see, there is a lot of interest here and this has rapidly emerged as an important component in our total audience measurement framework.","Next, we\u2019ll talk about Digital Ad Ratings. We have five important updates here. First, we continue to see impressive growth with the number of campaigns measured tripling year over year. We\u2019re now measuring well over 1 billion impressions per day. Second, we continue to win new clients. I won\u2019t list them all, but two that I will mention are Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors. Might be a little early in the day to talk about beer, but we\u2019re a global company and it\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock somewhere.","Third, we\u2019re also seeing strong growth with existing clients, evidenced that our measurement is becoming part of their ongoing business process. Fourth, we are expanding globally. By year-end, Digital Ad Ratings will be available in 16 markets which together cover 95% of global digital advertising spending.","And number five, our Google DoubleClick partnership continues to progress well. Based on the strength of our work here in the US, we recently reached agreement with Google to expand our DoubleClick integration internationally, beginning with Australia, Brazil, Canada and the UK as the first four markets. So lots of progress on Digital Ad Ratings.","Next, turning to Digital Content Ratings, we remain on track to the fall launch. The level of interest from clients has been incredible. Dozens of clients are actively participating in our client advisory board ahead of the launch and eight of those clients are already implementing our measurement technology as part of their beta rollout.","In April, we announced a deal with Roku. It\u2019s a groundbreaking deal for two reasons. First, it\u2019s an important step forward in our coverage of over-the-top viewing using connected devices. Nielsen is the first measurement service offered on Roku\u2019s platform which covers more than 25% of the over-the-top market in terms of devices sold. It\u2019s a very positive step forward for both Nielsen and Roku.","Second, this deal is also groundbreaking because we\u2019re now using our digital ad ratings metric to measure ads dynamically served to a TV screen. This shows the strength of our measurement architecture and its ability to scale to measure any ad digitally served at any device.","In marketing effectiveness, it was another great quarter with revenues up more than 20%. Our momentum in this area continues to be strong as we integrate our Watch and Buy assets to drive better marketing ROI. As mentioned earlier, this is another area where our eXelate acquisition is proving its value.","The client interest is broad-based. We strong demand from our media clients, of course, but we also have major engagements with clients like Walmart, who has recently adopted our full suite of marketing effectiveness capabilities. We\u2019re also working with LinkedIn to develop a global brand effectiveness program for their advertisers. And let\u2019s not forget we\u2019re also leveraging these same capabilities with our audio clients. Because of the strong broad-based growth in this area, we will continue to invest and the role of eXelate\u2019s platform capabilities will continue to grow here.","Let\u2019s not turn to the Buy business. Revenues in developed markets were up nearly 3%. In the first quarter, we saw a modest pickup in discretionary spend and that held fairly steady in the second quarter. I\u2019d like to highlight the stronger growth that we\u2019ve seen with our small and mid tier clients, particularly with our analytics products. We have a ton of opportunity with these clients, who are performing relatively well as a group and we continue to fine tune our service model for their particular needs.","Earlier, I mentioned that we had client wins in every region of the world. I won\u2019t highlight all of them, but one notable win I\u2019d like to mention is Coty, the global beauty products company with a strong portfolio across fragrances, cosmetics and skin and body care products. This is a great win for our US business and we\u2019re excited to be working with them. In early July, Coty announced their intent to acquire 43 additional brands from Procter & Gamble, making this win even more important for us.","In emerging markets, our business grew over 9% with double-digit growth in Greater China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Our investments in coverage and analytics in these markets continue to drive consistent sustainable growth.","Globally, Buy margins were up for the fourth straight quarter on a constant currency basis. As we said before, the investments we\u2019ve made in these regions over the past several years are paying off and the long-term trajectory for Buy margins will continue to be positive.","Changing topics, I want to recognize all of my Nielsen colleagues who participated in our fourth annual day of service. We call it Nielsen Global Impact Day. More than 22,000 Nielsen employees gave over 100,000 hours of service through 1400 volunteer activities across 92 countries. This is just one example of how the people of Nielsen act on our belief that our company needs to care for the markets and communities we rely on for our business.","Before I turn it over to Jamere, I want to touch on one more point. Innovation. In our 92-year history, a key to our ongoing success has been our commitment to innovation in all of its many forms. It might be our investments in R&D, which among other things, result in our strong patent portfolio. For instance, our digital ad ratings product already has eight patents granted with another 26 patents pending.","In other cases, our innovation might involve partnering with other companies to do something more or better than we could do on our own. For example, we partnered with Alibaba to leverage their e-commerce big data platform to help marketers create more successful new products in the highly competitive Chinese market.","Earlier this month, I visited our operations in Israel, which markets itself these days as start up nation. In Israel, Nielsen was the first multinational company granted a government license for its technology incubator. Located just outside Tel Aviv, our incubator houses 12 start ups, all at the cutting edge of innovation in analytics, mobile marketing and consumer information, a very impressive group of entrepreneurs and we\u2019re learning from all of them.","Israel is also where the R&D and technology teams for our eXelate business are based. They are an incredibly talented group who are creating the future for our eXelate business as well as now contributing to technology innovation all across Nielsen\u2019s portfolio.","Innovation in technology have been a big part of our past and they will be an even bigger part of our future growth. I\u2019ve seen it up close most recently in Israel, but it happens all over the world for us at Nielsen.","Over to you Jamere.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch, and good morning everyone. We had a great quarter with steady revenue growth, margin expansion, outstanding free cash flow and solid execution by our teams around the world. Our business remains well positioned to deliver consistent growth through this cycle and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation capability enable us to grow our business and return cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. We\u2019re very pleased with our progress and execution through the first half of the year.","First, I will hit the total company results for the second quarter. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 4.8% constant currency, with solid growth across both Watch and Buy. I will highlight again that this marks the 36th consecutive quarter of constant currency revenue growth, reflecting our remarkable consistency through the cycles.","Adjusted EBITDA was $468 million, up 7.3% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins was 30%, up 72 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to deliver strong productivity and margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments.","Adjusted net income was $246 million, up 10.3% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.66, up 13.8% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. Our earnings growth was fuelled by solid top line growth, strong operating leverage and our share repurchase plan, which I will remind you is to execute $1 billion of share repurchases by mid-2016.","Finally, free cash flow was $154 million in the quarter, up 33% versus prior year. Our teams are really focused on our cash flow performance and this gives us tremendous flexibility to grow and return cash to our shareholders. Again, a strong quarter for the total business, with solid execution through the first half of the year.","Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $707 million, up 4.7% constant currency. Accelerating growth in audience measurement and marketing effectiveness more than offset a 220 basis points drag from non-core other Watch products which we walked you through in the first quarter.","Our growth initiatives performed well as audience measurement was up 5.1% and excluding audio was up 6.8%. Digital ad ratings continued this momentum as the number of campaigns more than tripled versus a year ago, reflecting strong demand from advertisers and agencies.","The eXelate integration is progressing well and opening up some exciting growth opportunities with new and existing clients. Marketing effectiveness was up 21.7%, behind strong demand for [our action] products like Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Nielsen Buyer Insights, and we remain confident in our Watch 2015 revenue guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% on a constant currency basis.","Watch adjusted EBITDA was $314 million, up 6.1% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 56 basis points as we continued to drive productivity and operating leverage in the business. Our Watch segment is strong and gaining momentum as we execute on our total audience strategy and deliver on our growth initiatives.","Turning to Buy, our business had a great quarter with wins in every region around the world and strong margin expansion. Second quarter total Buy revenue was $852 million, up 4.8% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $582 million, up 2.8% on a constant currency basis and our business in the emerging markets was $270 million, up 9.3% on a constant currency basis.","In the developed markets, we continue to invest, resulting in growth in our subscription-based business. Discretionary spending has remained steady, particularly in areas like advanced analytics and innovation.","Emerging markets continue to remain strong and in particular we saw double-digit growth in Greater China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Our continued commitment to investing in coverage business with strong tailwind and emerging markets were up nearly 10% through the first half of the year.","Buy EBITDA was $162 million, up 9.5% constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were up 81 basis points in the quarter as we improve profitability and deliver margin expansion while we continue to invest in emerging markets. Overall, we had a great quarter in Buy with solid revenue growth and strong margin expansion on a constant currency basis.","Moving now to foreign currency impacts, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don\u2019t take on transactional risk so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes.","In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 700 basis points drag on revenue and a 560 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our first quarter call. If yesterday\u2019s spot rates held constant through 2015, we expect a 640 basis point drag on revenue and a 550 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2015, which is also in the ballpark of our previous estimate.","Moving now to 2015 guidance, our 2015 guidance remains unchanged, highlighted by adjusted net income per share of $2.60 to $2.66 per share and free cash flow of $850 million to $900 million. We remain confident in our plan to execute and deliver.","So to wrap, we\u2019re very pleased with our execution in the second quarter and through the first half of the year, where we delivered steady consistent revenue growth and margin expansion. We are delivering on our commitment to grow our business with investments in the key growth initiatives in both of our segments as well as coverage expansion in the emerging markets. Our execution along with our plans to return over $1 billion in cash back to shareholders in 2015 in the form of dividends and buybacks gives us confidence that we will continue to drive long-term shareholder value.","With that, I will turn it back to Kate.","Kate White Vanek","Thanks so much, Jamere. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian Wieser","I was wondering if you could talk about the impact that marketing effectiveness growth has on profitability. Just given the other partners that are involved, I was wondering how the profile varies from the rest of the Watch segment? And similarly, do you expect that DCR once it launches will have a different profitability at all?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","First, marketing effectiveness, as we mentioned, second straight quarter of north of 20% growth and it\u2019s adding value also to our core measurement products because it enhances \u2013 it brings to life just how important that core measurement is. Core measurement, ratings in this case, or some of the Buy data from that side of our business underpins a lot of the analytics products that are playing so successfully with clients in our marketing effectiveness practice. So a lot of that data already is in hand, because it\u2019s our data, in some cases it\u2019s data that we do acquire from other parties, but the fast growth here makes it very positive from a profitability perspective, Brian.","In terms of digital content ratings, we mentioned that we\u2019re on track. It\u2019s on track for the beta launch with the eight clients that are already implementing the technology and on track for a more full-scale launch in the fall. It will start to contribute to 2015 revenue, but it\u2019s not going to be a big factor this year. You\u2019re going to see it start to play a more important role next year.","The other thing I want to remind you about with respect to digital content ratings is our digital ad ratings product is out there kind of by itself right now. Doing great, by the way. But once digital content ratings is longsighted in the marketplace with these two metrics designed to be complementary to one another, that competitive strength of our digital ad ratings product only gets better. And so our already strong competitive position with digital ad ratings is only going to be enhanced by that. So we\u2019re looking forward to it; we just can\u2019t wait; we feel we\u2019re in a great position with this one.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Gubins with BAML.","Sara Rebecca Gubins","Maybe just following up on that, recognizing that growth from the digital content ratings will be fairly small upfront, could you just talk about the discussions that you\u2019re having with clients and how they are thinking about how \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re starting to build it into their budgets yet, any kind of indication that they are giving about how they might think about spending over time? And how you would expect it to flow through, is it a new sales process or are they already saying that they will sign up for it?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","It\u2019s, first of all, important to note that there is a wide range of clients out there. In some cases, it\u2019s our big media conglomerate clients, in other cases it\u2019s the digital first players, in other cases we are talking about the agencies. So there is quite a diversity of clients, with some of whom already employ a metric like digital content ratings for planning purposes and others that aren\u2019t currently using a metric like that, maybe they are using captive metrics we\u2019re planning in some other way.","So that diversity makes difficult to give a one answer to your question. It really depends on what the client\u2019s history is. But be sure about it, no matter how the clients worked with metrics like this in the past, we\u2019re ready to work with them. And we had different business models already in place even with our digital ad ratings product and I think you will see digital content ratings generally fall in line with how those business relationships work.","The other thing I\u2019ll add to that is recall also that we have our legacy digital rankings products and we will begin the transition of those clients from that product to digital content ratings and that process is on already underway.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Mitch, could you maybe just spend a little time on Arbitron, it looks like you\u2019re way down, or otherwise some really strong audience measurement growth?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","We are still thrilled with our acquisition of Arbitron; we call it Nielsen Audio now. It\u2019s on track for low single-digit growth, which is exactly where we expected it to be this year. We continue to pursue, of course, the international opportunity that this present, but we always said that that\u2019s going to be slow to develop just given the way those contracts tend to roll over around the world.","We continue to focus too to the analytics opportunity. I mentioned that is part of our marketing effectiveness area where our clients in that segment are leveraging the analytics products we have to drive the marketing ROI story around radio advertising. So it\u2019s also very positive.","And then digital streaming is the other area of opportunity here. And we\u2019ve seen our audio clients respond actually very aggressively to incorporate our mobile measurement technology, essentially the same technology we have for our video content, into their mobile apps and in many respects in fact they\u2019ve leaped ahead of our video clients in terms of incorporating that technology. So we feel great about with that part.","The other piece though is to get the industry, the major industry players to agree on how we\u2019ll report listening of digital streaming. And we\u2019ve been working to build consensus on that. And what I\u2019ll say to you on that front is we are very close now, almost there, we expect to be able to push that across the line in the very near future. Jamere, anything to add?","Jamere Jackson","Look, the linearity in this business isn\u2019t perfect. The timing of deliveries can be a little lumpy from quarter to quarter, a few hundred thousand dollars can swing the growth rate on a quarter, but we will deliver low single digit rates of growth in audio as expected in 2015 and the back of the year will be up around 3% and that\u2019s just based on timing and normal contract growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Developed markets was very strong again at about 3% growth, can you talk about \u2013 you mentioned the advanced analytics and the subscription-based products as driving that in the Q, so could you just give a little bit more color on those products?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","The key for us in developed markets is, as I mentioned earlier, the small and mid tier segment of clients. We\u2019ve always been strong with the big global multinationals. Because of our global footprint, 106 markets around the world covering more than 90% of population, so we\u2019re really the obvious choice for the big global firms.","With that small and mid tier clients segment, it\u2019s still a great growth opportunity for us and we\u2019ve been giving that more focus. And as I mentioned, fine-tuning our service model to better fit their particular needs, in particular, yes, the analytics products that have kind of lead the front for us on that, so we feel great about the path we are on there, the trajectory we have with those important client segments. So we are generally performing a little bit better in the marketplace than some of their global counterparts.","We see that being true not only here in the US, but also in Europe and frankly that same dynamic applies even to the emerging markets where the local companies and the rising regional players are generally outperforming the global companies in terms of winning market share, being more nimble with their innovation, just moving a little bit more quickly. So very important segment of our client base.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman","I wanted to jump into the other subsegment of Watch, which dragged constant currency Watch revenue by 220 basis points in the second, which was kind of the same as the first and I had been thinking that might be somewhat less. I was wondering if the run-off of legacy net ratings happened quicker than expected, was that on purpose or a natural evolution and how should we think about this other subsegment impacting the second half of the year?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","So we expect the drag to be similar in the back half of the year. Recall, we walked you through the pieces of this in the first quarter. So the drag of two points was about the same point as the first quarter. The reshaping of the portfolio is progressing well and while I won\u2019t comment on specific transactions, we feel confident that will be largely complete by the end of the year. We remain confident in our Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% because the core of our business remains strong and the growth initiatives that we talked about in audience measurement and marketing effectiveness have great momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William Arthur Warmington","A question for you on eXelate, you\u2019ve had the acquisition now for almost 5 months and I wanted to ask if the audience segmentation real-time analytics where as strong as you\u2019d hoped? And then also when we can expect the division to have \u2013 start to have meaningful financial contribution for you?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","We feel better than we expected is really the short answer to your question. Look, we just couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this acquisition of eXelate. So far, the business is tracking ahead of plan. The integration is going exceptionally well. The eXelate business itself is performing well, but as I mentioned earlier, eXelate team also contributing to other parts of Nielsen\u2019s business.","I mean, to give you an example really, we recently won a US measurement business on the Buy side of our business with a big global consumer packaged goods firm who had been working with our competitor here in the US. And a key part of our proposal that caused them to switch their business to us was our digital capability. So in particular, the digital capability that eXelate allows us to bring to the table.","In fact, when I had a call with the CEO of this company after they made their decision, he signaled this out as really the driving factor for why they were really excited about switching their business to Nielsen. So it\u2019s a great story, it\u2019s a story we\u2019ve been building our company around, telling for a long time, it\u2019s really starting to find traction in the marketplace. And eXelate is only added to the strength of that story. So again, we just couldn\u2019t be happy with how this one is going and I think you\u2019ll see eXelate continue to contribute outside of its historical compounds all across our portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio","Mitch, going back to the earlier question about small and mid tier in Buy versus more global CPGs, can you just talk about the difference in growth rates? Are the global CPGs growing?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","I think you\u2019re asking the difference in growth rates for global CPGs relative to the small mid tier clients. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re referring to their growth rates or our growth rates with them, but in either case, I think you\u2019re going to see a fairly similar picture.","If you look around the world, as I mentioned earlier, the small and mid tier companies, local giants as we sometimes refer to them in the emerging markets, they are winning market share from the global companies. Not in every case, but just in general as a group and largely because I think they\u2019ve been more focused on top line growth, on innovation in particular. They\u2019ve just been willing to move faster and take more risks and our business profile aligns up very well against those clients because of the breadth of our portfolio.","When you\u2019re focusing more on growth initiatives, innovation, hey, we\u2019re the world leader in those areas, in particular on new product innovation. And so that plays well with that segment of the market. And then as that feeds into those products entering into the marketplace, the core measurement services that we have are incredibly important as they then want to make sure that their marketing effectiveness gets optimized, they want to improve their marketing mix, they want to drive increased decision behind those new product launches.","Another thing that happens with the small and mid tier clients is they often don\u2019t have as much staff in house and so they can tend to be a little bit more reliant on Nielsen to help them through this process. And so as I mentioned, that\u2019s where we are continuing to work to fine tune our service model to make sure we\u2019re as well positioned as we possibly can be with that particular segment of the market.","Operator","Next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank","So I think if I triangulate a couple of data points here, you kind of feel solidly like you\u2019re executing in the middle of your target range for Watch revenue, but you talked about the building of traction for a bunch of new products, OCR, DCR, clients, platforms, Nielsen Audio international as well as the digital platform and the timing issues of contracts and what impacts the growth of that business. And you contrast that with the headwinds from net ratings, which you have a pretty clear path to kind of comping themselves.","So if you triangulate this, you really should be able to see a pretty clear path to consistent performance at the upper end of the range and probably a breakthrough beyond that into kind of a step function up. And again if you look at all of the environment you\u2019re talking about, one would see that I think we\u2019re kind of on the cusp of that step function up. Would you agree with that, like could you put any timing around it if you do?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","First, I love your view of the future, that\u2019s great. But on the other hand, it does assume that everything goes perfectly. And that\u2019s exactly the way we plan, but we also planned for some things to change in the market which has been a history especially the recent history in digital and media, all across our Watch business, the pace of change right now is faster than anybody can recall in this industry\u2019s history.","And so if everything stays in place right now, we\u2019re perfectly positioned. We love our competitive position. But things do continue to move around and that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re not going to give you the answer, the final answer to your question. But I like the way that scenario can unfold and we have all the places that we can see that our clients need right now in place or in progress building towards this total audience framework. Again. measuring that dealing across all of the screens, devises and platforms, doing it in a way that\u2019s comparable across all those environments, so they can put them altogether to give a comprehensive view of the consumer. We\u2019re in a great position as far as that critical need that our clients have.","Jamere Jackson","Dave, just to follow on to that, as I said, look, we remain confident in our Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% because the core of our business remains strong based on our progress with the growth initiatives that we\u2019ve talked about and we\u2019ve talked about here on the call. If you look at the back half of the year, if you just look at audience measurement being 6%, plus like I said audio will be up about 3% and marketing effectiveness and other Watch does what it did in the first half of the year, then we are solidly in the middle of the guidance range that we gave which gives us a lot of confidence. So the initiatives that you talked about have great momentum and it\u2019s what gives us confidence to hit the guidance range for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler","I was wondering if you could give a update on, from your perspective, are the industry conversations of creating a new currency metric for video advancing at all meaningfully? And as part of those discussions, is there any meaningful discussion about potentially fragmenting to a multi-currency world or is that not even being discussed?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","We are making progress on that front. First, it starts with our strategy, our focus on this total audience measurement framework and we\u2019re making great progress. Our clients have given us very positive feedback on that strategy, exactly what they need. So the first thing we have to do is simply to execute on that strategy, which we\u2019ve been doing, whether it\u2019s on digital content ratings coming out to the market which is on track, whether it\u2019s our video on demand coverage which has grown rapidly over the last few months, over-the-top through our deal with Roku, the panel expansion of our television audience measurement panels, lots of fronts where we simply need to continue to execute. And by the end of this year, we feel we\u2019ll be in very good shape in terms of bringing that full total audience measurement framework to reality.","And then the second thing, as you pointed out, is fostering this conversation that is necessary for the industry to have around redefining the currency. So what we\u2019ve been doing on that front in the last few months is meeting with as many of the senior leaders from the major media companies as possible. We have met with a vast majority of them already and we will eventually get to all of them.","To get their input and their thoughts on how the currency should be redefined and don\u2019t forget the current definition of the currency C3 or C7 was put in place by the industry back in 2006 and consumers changed a lot since then. So the need is for the definition of the currency to be broadened to incorporate more of the ways that consumers are watching television content across all these different environments today. And so we\u2019ve been fostering that conversation. Eventually the key opportunity is to bring these industry leaders together, having them sit around the same table at the same time and drive toward consensus on this redefinition. And that will be out in front of us as the year progresses.","We\u2019re already, though, seeing signs of encouragement here in the form of our contract renewals with our big media clients. And what I mean here is those contract renewal discussions now are starting to shape themselves around this framework of total audience measurement. And that\u2019s a sign to us that our clients already see where this one is going and they are already trying to prepare for the future in terms of the way their contracts are structured with this. And so for us that\u2019s a real positive sign of validation of their confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute and where they see the future of the industry going.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger","I\u2019d like to talk on the theme of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion, if I might. Jamere, I know Mitch has talked about this as a big priority, in fact I think he said he has it written in big bold letters on the whiteboard across from his desk. And I know you called out some progress on that in the quarter. So some of the types of things I\u2019d hope you comment on is just, can you talk about some of the specific initiatives that you\u2019re using to execute on the goal of improving free cash flow conversion? What lines on the cash flow and balance sheet will we see that progress on? What does success look like? And if I might just dangle this out there, if you look at 2016, man, that $1 billion sort of free cash flow target looks like an awfully tempting aspiration. I know you won\u2019t give us guidance like that, but maybe do you agree that that\u2019s a nice aspiration to shoot for?","Jamere Jackson","Certainly it\u2019s a nice aspiration to shoot for, Todd, and thank you for the question. Listen, around free cash flow, we\u2019re just running a place with intensity and you\u2019re going to see us execute on the things that Mitch has talked about around working capital. We are working with all of our teams around the world on really to blocking and tackling associated with that, because it\u2019s an important driver for us as we look to grow our business and return cash to shareholders.","A couple things you\u2019re also starting to see from a free cash flow standpoint is that the restructuring rate has gone down as we\u2019ve gotten through the lion\u2019s share of the major productivity initiatives and transformation activities inside the company. So running the place with intensity, being really focused on the key working capital metrics will pay huge dividends for us and we\u2019re going to put the capital to work.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","[indiscernible] weigh in on this one. We don\u2019t have inventory as you know Todd, so this is largely about payables and receivables and there\u2019s no silver bullet. We talk about it with our teams all the time. No silver bullet here. This is good old grind it out execution by our teams and whatever comes down to that, I love the way the Nielsen teams respond. I know many of my Nielsen colleagues listen in over the phone, so I just got to give them credit and thank them for their efforts on this front. I know it\u2019s important for our investors and we\u2019ll continue the progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen","Most of my questions have been taken care, but I wanted to ask about media measurement progress both inside and outside of the US in terms of total audio and so I certainly heard what you\u2019ve said thus far. But ITV in the UK reported this morning and they said and I know you\u2019re not the provider of measurement services in the UK, but they said they think it\u2019ll be a good three years before they can get something like a total audience measurement system there. I just wonder if you have any comments on that or any other markets outside of the US and if you could compare that with how progress is in the US?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Our position in the US is unique in many respects, size being of course the most notable one. The consumers, the same thing is happening with the consumer almost every place in the world. And so there is the same need of media clients and agencies and advertisers also in all of these other markets around the world. So one of the reasons why we put such emphasis on our global expansion of digital ad ratings, as I mentioned, by the end of this year, we\u2019ll be in 16 markets around the world.","And while there is more than 100 important markets around the world, the 16 markets that we\u2019ll be in, that actually represents 95% of global digital advertising spend. So we\u2019ve chosen those markets very carefully and those are the markets where this total audience measurement framework has the most importance to the way advertising dollars are spent in these parts of the world. So we\u2019re incredibly well positioned there, but it will develop more slowly, I think, or on a schedule that will be more prolonged than what you\u2019re seeing develop here in the US. And the world that we might play, market to market might be a little bit different as well.","In some cases, collaborating with other players in the market. I\u2019ll give you an example of that. In Germany, the television audience measurement in Germany is provided by another company called GFK and we\u2019re the digital provider. And so it\u2019s incumbent upon the two of us to work together in that market in order to meet the needs that the market has. And so, you\u2019ll see some of that unfold in certain markets around the world as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","This is probably for Jamere. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more detail about what you\u2019re seeing with respect to the discretionary spend in the Buy segment? Should we be interpreting the comments around 2Q being steady as being flat versus the first quarter, any color on how you\u2019re expecting the second half to play out given the conversations you\u2019re having, any particular products that are most in demand or regions you would call out any of that stuff?","Jamere Jackson","As Mitch highlighted in his comments, we did see some moderate improvements in the first quarter, actually some of it started in the fourth quarter of last year and it remained steady through the first half of the year. Some of our key clients are starting to see an uptick in volume and pricing and that points to a fairly positive outlook for the back half of the year. But I would say steady being what we\u2019re focused on for the back half of the year and what we expect to deliver and I would say it\u2019s about in line with what we saw in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","Mitch I\u2019m hoping to dig in on some of your comments on digital ad ratings. Could you just talk a bit about those in your expansion internationally? It seems you accelerated the pace of rollout a little bit, could you touch on the drivers there? Are you seeing better uptake than you originally envisioned or is it something else? And perhaps one for Jamere, how should we be thinking about ongoing investments in ad ratings in light of you soon being able to cover most of the important geographies?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","First for digital ad ratings, this is largely our plan all along that you see playing out. Probably the one piece of it, very important piece by the way that jumped the queue and happened a little bit faster than what we might have thought a year ago is our rollout of digital ad ratings to China. Obviously, a very important market.","The way we deliver the digital ad ratings product in most markets around the world obviously is leveraging our relationship with Facebook and their user registration database, which of course doesn\u2019t serve the same purpose in China, but the good news is there we made a partnership with partnership with Tencent, a huge digital player, headquartered in that market. And so their user registration database serves the same purpose that Facebook\u2019s does otherwise in most of the other markets around the world. And that allowed us to accelerate that particular component which obviously is a really big very, very important win.","Otherwise, what you see playing out with digital ad ratings in terms of our global expansion is, yes, it\u2019s just our plan playing out. There\u2019s an important component to it which I did mention earlier, I just want to highlight again and that is our global expansion through our partnership with Google on their DoubleClick platform. And we continue to work with Google in a very big and broad way.","YouTube, lots of Google properties, the DoubleClick integration here in the US has progressed very well. And as I mentioned earlier, that led to this expansion to these other markets. We\u2019re starting with the first four that I mentioned, Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United Kingdom, with more to follow. But that\u2019s another piece. That\u2019s really important part of our digital ad ratings expansion around the world. Jamere?","Jamere Jackson","In terms of the investment profile, the platform is already built. So it will be a very efficient rollout for us around the world both from a capital and from an operating expense standpoint. The platform is built. It\u2019s scaled very nicely. And so the margins associated with our rollout around the world will be accretive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura Martin","This one is for you, Jamere. So your margin expansion was really nice in both segments, but especially in Buy the 81 basis points was above your full year guidance. Could you just remind you us what the cost out initiatives are in the Buy segment that you guys are taking and also the productivity focus that\u2019s helping the margins in the Watch segment? Could you just remind us of what those are?","Jamere Jackson","So on the Buy side of the business, listen, we\u2019ve had four straight quarters of Buy margin expansion. The second quarter was up 81 basis points, the first half is up 64 basis points and we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver the margin expansion necessary in the back half of the year to get us to 50 basis points to 70 basis points of margin expansion for the total company.","I would say there are two key drivers. One is the scale emerging markets is giving us a lift. So some of those early investments are starting to scale and we\u2019re starting to see nice margin expansion associated with it. And then the second one is really around running the place with intensity around cost and productivity and I give a lot of credit to John Lewis and the commercial teams and Brian Westin and the operations teams in terms of making sure that we\u2019ve got a full plate of productivity initiatives that are continuing to drive margin expansion for us.","And then on the Watch side of the business, from a margin standpoint, we\u2019ve had great margin expansion in our Watch business historically. It is a business where we get incremental pricing and we get great leverage on that incremental pricing as we continue to deliver to our clients. And so running the place with intensity around productivity, making sure that we get good leverage on price increases that we get is what we\u2019re doing inside the company.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Laura, for us productivity is a continual process. We don\u2019t wait until we have a hole to fill or a problem to cover. I think they are trying to find cost savings. We\u2019re doing it every day on a continuous basis. In fact, when our teams want to come to us to ask us for investment growth we\u2019re always pointing it right back to them to say first thing you do is you go find some of the money for growth through your own productivity efforts and start there. So this is just a way the company is built itself and it\u2019s a continuous process for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Bird with FBR.","Bill Bird","In the US, what\u2019s a realistic timeframe to get to a redefinition of the TV currency? And then separately, how did your local ratings business perform in the quarter?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","On redefining the currency, we\u2019ve seen this movie before back in 2006 when the current definition of the currency was put in place, C3. That process took about a year and involves a lot of back and forth, a lot of debate and ultimately reaching consensus. And the way, if you were to graph it, it\u2019s probably something that moves very slowly, very gradually and then suddenly, it comes to consensus. And my best guess is that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to happen this time as well.","And what we\u2019ve done to foster the progress on that front, as I mentioned earlier, is have these discussions, engaging all of the senior executives from as many of the big media companies as we can sit down with and working our way through that process. So we\u2019re listening to all of them, making sure it\u2019s right on their radar as well and then ultimately driving everybody to come together around the same table to push to closure. So again, it will probably move gradually and then suddenly, like a lot of things happen in the world these days. And you saw our audience measurement business was up 6.8% excluding audio and local was a key contributor to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Douglas Arthur","Just switching back to Buy for a second, the 9.3% growth in emerging markets, obviously that\u2019s a lot faster than the sort of big CPGs are growing. If you sort of break that down, how much of it is additional territories covered and how much of it is actually bringing on local clients? And is there anything at this point holding back the upside in the growth rate there?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks for the question, Doug. Look, we say it all the time. We continue to be underpenetrated in these markets. We still have lots of development opportunity in these markets. And so we should have the ability to grow at a rate that isn\u2019t perfectly tied to what you see happening with GDP.","The second thing to your point, our client portfolio in these parts of the world is diverse. We work not only with the big global companies where you see the growth rates that they report, but also these faster growing local firms and rising regional players and our business position with them is very strong.","The key to that for us is the leadership for our business in these parts of the world, they generally are people who are from those parts of the world. It\u2019s a little different from what you\u2019ll find in a lot of the other companies. So our leader in China is from China. Our leader in Southeast Asia, she is from Southeast Asia. And so they understand how these markets work, how relationships play and your business progress, we\u2019re incredibly well positioned and that\u2019s why we feel confident in our ability to continue the growth rate in the guidance range that we\u2019ve got before for emerging markets which is the 8% to 10% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group.","Thomas Eagan","Follow on the discussion of video currency, Mitch last quarter in talking about this, you mentioned the need for the data to start flowing, especially the mobile viewing data. So where are we today in that data flow and are clients, do they seem to be content with the data itself?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Mobile is another critical part of our total audience measurement framework and we\u2019re up to more than 120 different network and distributers now that we\u2019re working with our mobile measurement capability. That\u2019s up quite a bit from where we were a quarter ago. And data is starting to flow to a lot of those players, they are starting to see it.","And let me first say, look, mobile continues to be very important and it continues to grow rapidly. But as companies see more of this mobile viewing data, I think one thing that they realize is it\u2019s still relatively small. For instance, in relation through video-on-demand viewing, video-on-demand is probably two to three times bigger in terms of time spent viewing video content than mobile, at least where we stand today. And so you see more emphasis, more focus being put on video-on-demand right now because it\u2019s just a much bigger part of that viewing that\u2019s currently falling outside of the traditional TV environment.","Nonetheless, we\u2019re going to continue forward making progress with not only the mobile measurement portion of our total audience measurement framework, but every other important part of that framework. And by the end of this year, data will be flowing through as many parts of that as possible. We think we\u2019re going to have incredibly complete coverage and again, measuring the consumer comparably across all these environments so they can be put together to give that complete and total view.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tracy Young with Evercore ISI.","Tracy Young","One question on the tax rate. Should we just be using the tax rate that you had for Q2 for the remainder of the year? And then just a clarification on margins, should we assume as you improve the margins on the Buy side that is coming from the emerging markets?","Jamere Jackson","On the tax rate, you saw our guidance for the year was unchanged on the cash tax number, so I would use that as your build in your model for the year. We\u2019re probably a little bit light in the front half, but we expect to be in that guidance range for the total year. And then in terms of margins for the year, again, we had great progress through the first half of the year. We\u2019re up over 70 basis points and we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re going to deliver that in the back half of the year based on all the things we have going.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think earlier in the call for the first time you mentioned sort of being able to measure the dynamic ad measurements I think that you referred to. If you could just elaborate on that and also just some color on your digital strategy in the context of now Hulu trying to move more to subscription with supported, do you see any trends there that could force you to change that strategy?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","What we mentioned earlier in terms of dynamic ad insertion, they had to do with our new partnership with Roku and the idea that \u2013 we\u2019re already measuring obviously dynamically inserted ads across the digital landscape, but here now we\u2019re able to measure it also on a TV screen. When an ad gets dynamically served to a TV screen, that was one of the groundbreaking components of this deal with Roku. So again, highlighting the strength of our measurement architecture, being able to measure an ad that\u2019s digitally served to any device, any device and that\u2019s what we think is so important.","On our digital strategy and your point about what you see with Hulu now offering a subscription-only model, the way I think about this funding model question for the industry, consumers love this great content that\u2019s out there and that content has to get paid for obviously, or else it doesn\u2019t get produced. And there\u2019s two main ways it gets paid for. One is the monthly cable bill, the subscriptions, and the other is the advertising that funds it.","And I think a lot of what you see in the industry right now with the growth of subscription video-on-demand and Hulu now offering something in that area, bundles, all of this stuff is downward pressure on the subscription side of the funding model in the ecosystem.","On the other hand, there\u2019s the advertising side of the funding model which I think has a very bright future ahead of it. The reason why I say that is, look, there\u2019s more data coming to the marketplace. There\u2019s better technology than there\u2019s ever been before. Advertising is able to be delivered with more precision and more relevance than ever has been possible before. And that\u2019s only going to drive up the value of advertising.","And as the value of advertising increases, I think you\u2019re going to see more investment in advertising. It just makes sense. Money that would otherwise be spent somewhere else in the marketing budget, more of that money will find its way to advertising. So if you look at that funding model over time, we think the future is bright for the advertising side of the funding model. But yes, right now the dynamics are for continued downward pressure on the other side of the funding model.","Kate White Vanek","Operator, I think that concludes the Q&A portion of our call. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mitch for some closing comments.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Thanks again everybody for joining the call. And just a few closing comments before we wrap up. We had a great quarter with solid financial performance. It was our 36th consecutive quarter of constant currency revenue growth, growing margins in both our Watch and Buy segments, and of course, strong free cash flow growth. We had great execution on all parts of our strategy, beginning with total audience measurement, it remains our number one priority. It\u2019s perfectly aligned with what the market needs. They need independent third-party measurement, bringing comparable currency grade ratings at both content and ads across all the screens and devices and platforms that consumers are going to these days.","And it\u2019s innovation that\u2019s driving our progress on our total audience measurement framework. Innovation on digital ad ratings, digital content ratings, BOD, over-the-top, and even our TV measurement through our ratings enhancement plan. Innovation there too.","Our marketing effectiveness practice, another quarter of 20% plus growth and also another area where our eXelate acquisition is helping us to attract new clients and we\u2019re just adding value to our company. It\u2019s a strong quarter for our Buy business. Client wins in every region of the world and continued strong growth in emerging markets.","And lastly, capital allocation. We continue with this balanced approach, we remain focused on delivering incremental shareholder value. So thanks again for joining the call and thanks for your interest in Nielsen.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15578":["Nielsen N.V.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to the host, Kate Vanek, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Vanek, you may proceed.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks so much, Tiffany, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nielsen's second quarter 2014 financial performance. Joining me on today's call from Nielsen is Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer; and Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. We posted slides on our website that we'll use on this call, under the Events section of our IR website at nielsen.com\/investors.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you all that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of '95. These forward-looking statements may include comments about Nielsen's outlook, expectations and prospects and are based on Nielsen's view as of today, July 29, 2014. Our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that we believe are material are outlined in our 10-K and other filings and materials, which you can also find on our website.","Turning to the agenda for today's call, Mitch will start with some comments on our results for the quarter and an overview of some key highlights and provide a business update. Then Jamere will discuss financials for the quarter, as well as provide any updates on our full year guidance. [Operator Instructions]","And now, to start the call, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Mitch Barns.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. We appreciate the opportunity to update you on our business. We had a strong second quarter, and we continue to extend our leadership positions in both retail and audience measurement in key markets all around the globe. So let's walk through a high-level look at the numbers for the quarter.","First, revenue grew almost 16% on a constant currency basis. If we exclude our acquisitions of Arbitron and Harris Interactive, the core top line growth was just over 5%.","The Watch side of our business had another strong quarter, growing almost 6%, reflecting the increasing momentum we have in digital and the continued strong growth in Ad Solutions. On the Buy side, revenues increased just under 5%, driven largely by over 9% growth in developing markets and also some new client wins.","Next, adjusted EBITDA was up 16.2% or just under 18% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted net income per share was $0.62, up more than 29%. Our free cash flow of $116 million was up over 8% in the quarter versus the prior year.","Now onto a few other updates that I want to call to your attention. First, the ongoing successful integration of Nielsen Audio continues to have a favorable impact on our results, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress. Second, we continued to execute against our long-term capital plans that we shared with you earlier this year. We increased our dividend 25% in May, and we further strengthened our balance sheet with our most recent debt refinancing activity. Separately following another secondary offering by our private equity sponsors during the quarter, over 80% of Nielsen shares are now publicly held. And lastly, we're pleased to reiterate our guidance for 2014.","As we close another successful quarter of growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation here at Nielsen, we remain well-positioned to achieve both our short- and long-term goals and drive shareholder value. Our business and our priorities, as you've heard from us before, are guided every day by 2 big trends operating in the marketplace: Population growth and media fragmentation. We stay in front of these trends by increasing coverage, coverage of sales and coverage of consumers as they consume video, audio and other content in a growing number of ways. We focus on measuring performance for our clients and then helping our clients to improve performance. And these are things that every client needs: Measurement and improvement.","Let's take a closer look at some of the specific efforts that we're working on against these objectives. The first one is the progress we've made with our audience measurement strategy, especially the digital component, with OCR's increasing penetration with media clients, agencies and publishers. Specifically, I'd like to call out Mobile OCR, which we launched on July 1. And we couldn't be more pleased with the quick adoption and success we've seen so far in the marketplace. We have over 100 clients already using Mobile OCR, and many of these are first-time OCR clients. The rapid adoption aligns with the rapid growth of mobile advertising, which you've seen reflected in some of the recent numbers from Facebook, Google and others. This is an incredibly important step forward for OCR. Adding mobile coverage was #1 on almost every client's list.","In Audio, we've been hard at work at developing our digital audio measurement capabilities that the market very much needs, and we've made good progress. Our measurement technology is rolling out, with more than 20 clients currently in various stages of implementation, and we're already in the pilot phase of measurement for many of these clients.","On the global front, a highlight from the quarter was our recent win of the radio audience measurement business in Turkey, which is an important growth market. The opportunity to expand internationally was one of the key reasons for our acquisition of Arbitron, and this win in Turkey is an example of our progress on that front.","In Ad Solutions, which you'll hear us increasingly refer to as marketing effectiveness going forward, we continue to help our clients improve the ROI of their marketing spend. In a time when many of our major consumer packaged goods clients are focused on productivity gains and cost-cutting in their developed markets, this becomes an increasingly important metric for CMOs. And while this is a competitive space, our audience measurement data differentiates us, and this is one of the reasons why we again saw double-digit growth this quarter as we further penetrated our core client base, media and consumer packaged goods companies, but we also continued to expand our reach into a number of other verticals, including auto, financial services and retail.","Next, a few words about the investments that we're making in our business. In our Buy segment, developing markets remain a critical growth driver for our clients and for Nielsen, and so you'll see us continue to make these investments for the foreseeable future. With favorable trends like growing populations, a rising middle class and growing disposable incomes, the key developing markets, markets like India, China Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil and Africa, these markets continue to have terrific long-term growth potential, as shown by the strong growth in our business across these markets during the quarter.","Separately, we continued to see great adoption of our product called Global Track Complete among our large multinational clients. This capability is especially valuable for the global players because it harmonizes data across markets to provide globally consistent KPIs, and that enables these companies to better see and manage the performance of their business globally.","Separately, in the U.S., our Answers On Demand platform reached a major milestone in the quarter. It's now deployed to more than 200 clients, representing thousands of users. Answers On Demand, by the way, is a high-performance delivery platform that provides our clients with direct access to a broad portfolio of information.","To close out this bullet on our investments and returning to our Watch segment, our U.S. team recently announced plans to increase sample sizes for our local TV audience measurement service. We're investing in larger sample sizes in 15 local people meter markets and 31 set meter markets. These larger sample sizes will bring increased stability to our local TV ratings.","And finally, e-commerce. E-commerce is, of course, a fast-growing retail channel for us to measure, but it's not just that. E-commerce providers are also playing a growing role as marketing platforms to drive off-line sales for brands, and that creates additional opportunity for us. On our previous earnings call, we encouraged you to stay tuned for further developments from us in this area.","And earlier this month, we announced the launch of an important new service called Omni Channel. For Omni Channel, we're working with Alibaba in China to provide marketers with an integrated view of online and off-line purchasing in the world's most important growth market. We're fired up about this one, and here's why. Prior to this deal, marketers could know what they were selling on Alibaba's platforms, and they could also know what they were selling off-line through grocery channels, but it wasn't easy for them to bring those 2 views together and to compare them or to get a total view of the market because online and off-line sales were being reported differently, meaning there were different category definitions, different time periods and so on.","Now through our Omni Channel service, marketers can see it all in a common context, on an apples-to-apples basis and from an independent third-party, Nielsen. This is an important first step, and we have a lot more runway here to build out additional services. And it all fits perfectly with our objective to provide measurement and improvement to the clients and markets we serve.","To sum up, we feel really good about the strength of our business and our progress during the quarter. We remain confident in our ability to execute well for the near term, while continuing to plan and build for the future.","Now I'll turn it over to Jamere, and he'll give you a deeper look at the numbers.","Jamere Jackson","Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. As Mitch indicated, we delivered a solid second quarter performance, reflecting another quarter of strong execution and the strength of our business model.","Revenue was $1.59 billion, up 15.9% constant currency. Excluding the impact of Audio and Harris, revenues grew 5.2% constant currency.","Adjusted EBITDA was $460 million, up 17.9% constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.9%, up 50 basis points, due primarily to the accretive impact of Nielsen Audio, but also the continued progress on our productivity initiatives. Adjusted net income was $240 million, up 31.1% constant currency. And diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.62, up 29.2% versus prior year. Finally, we generated $116 million in free cash flow, up 8.4% versus a year ago.","Overall, I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and the solid results that we've delivered across the business.","Next, I'll move to the segment revenue and give you a little color on the pieces. As I mentioned, revenue was up 15.9% for the quarter. Our revenue growth was broad-based across both Watch and Buy. This also marks the 32nd consecutive quarter of revenue growth for our business, reflecting our ability to deliver growth due to cycles.","Total Buy revenue was $900 million, up 7.9% in constant currency and up 4.8% excluding the Harris acquisition. Our information business grew 5% to $676 million constant currency. We benefited from good demand in retail measurement services, key client wins and strengthened our developing or emerging markets.","Our Insights business revenue was $224 million, up 17.9% constant currency or up 4.2% excluding Harris, due to strength in developing markets and more modest growth in North America. Developing markets were up 9.2% as we saw broad-based growth in many of our markets. We continue to see double-digit growth with our local clients and steady progress with our multinational clients in places like China, Latin America and India. We remain committed to investing in coverage and capability to help our clients grow in these markets, and we remain confident in our strategy. I've spent some time in Europe in 2Q, and I'm looking forward to visiting our teams in Asia in 3Q to see firsthand some of the exciting opportunities that we have there.","Finally, our Watch business revenue was $694 million, up 28.3% constant currency or 5.9% excluding Arbitron. We see continued strength in audience measurement. And as Mitch mentioned, our digital initiatives have tremendous momentum, with the rapid client adoption following the launch of Mobile OCR.","We continue to see double-digit growth in Ad Solutions, and the Arbitron integration is progressing well. We're on track to deliver the synergies, and we're seeing early dividends from our efforts to build out the business. So again, broad-based revenue growth for the quarter across both Watch and Buy.","Moving to profitability. Buy EBITDA was $167 million, up 3.1% constant currency. The dynamics within our Buy business are in line with our strategy: one, to invest in a very disciplined way in developing marketing coverage to fuel long-term growth and support our clients; two, invest in our platforms to support new client wins; and three, invest in products to support our existing client base with products such as Answers On Demand and Global Track Complete, which Mitch mentioned earlier. These are the right bets for the business, and we remain confident in our strategy.","On the Watch side, EBITDA grew 27.5% to $301 million constant currency, driven by the addition of the Arbitron business and solid growth that generates operating leverage in our audience measurement business. Overall, profitability remained strong, while we continue to invest in our key growth catalysts.","Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this is strictly the translation impact for reporting purposes. Hence, in the quarter, we saw a foreign currency impact that resulted in a 90 basis points drag on revenue and 170 basis points drag on EBITDA, in the ballpark of what we laid out in our April call. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through the rest of the year, then this is the estimated impact on future revenue and EBITDA, and this anticipated drag is included in our full year adjusted net income outlook.","Moving to the balance sheet and key metrics. On the top left are some of the key financial metrics, which were all in line with our expectations. On the bottom left is our pro forma net debt ratio. Our gross debt is $6.7 billion, with $263 million in cash to get the $6.4 billion of net debt and a 3.6x ratio.","On the capital table on the right, you can see that we've remixed our debt by taking out the remaining $800 million of the 7.75% notes and tacked on an additional $800 million in 5% notes. And based on our recent refinancing activities, our weighted average interest rate is 3.86%, which is down 42 basis points versus our March 31 pro forma. And this is really solid execution on our capital markets activity, which we laid out earlier in the year.","Finally, I want to reaffirm our 2014 guidance and all the elements you see laid out on Slide 13. Let me highlight a few key dynamics. As we look to the second half of the year, we feel very good about our Watch business. We expect continued momentum in both audience measurement, which includes all of our digital initiatives in Ad Solutions.","In our Buy business, first half growth was solid in both the developed and the developing regions. In the second quarter, we started to see some tightening with our North American clients. This tends to manifest itself in tighter spending on new categories with certain data sets, as clients experience more modest growth than they expected. And if this continues, we're certainly not immune to these dynamics, and we'll watch it closely in the back half. As it pertains to the other regions, Europe continues to perform in line with our expectations for the year, and the developing markets should remain strong.","Finally, we're reaffirming our cash flow of roughly $700 million, and lowering our interest expense to approximately $300 million versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $310 million. And the recent actions we've taken will give us tremendous flexibility to grow our business and return capital to shareholders in an investor-friendly way.","So to wrap up, look, I feel very good about 2014. We continue to be in a great position to deliver strong returns for our shareholders, and we're well-positioned into the future.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Kate.","Kathryn H. White Vanek","Thanks so much, Jamere. Tiffany, we'd love to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, 2 questions. The first, a quick one. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of total Ad Solutions revenue now, maybe at least annualized? And the second question, a bit broader. So we've done some of our own proprietary work segmenting the online video market into what I call premium, which we think of as advertisers who truly view online as a substitute for television versus non-premium, where it's kind of dollars falling from the digital bucket to the video digital bucket, right? So -- and that premium market today, to us, is less than about 15% of the total online video market. And it's probably not going to grow that much in the near term from there. So in that context, I wonder if we revisited your long-term targets for OCR revenue given out at the Investor Day, they're a function of the overall video market as opposed to the kind of premium versus non-premium market, do you think there's a bifurcation of OCR as the key currency between premium and non-premium? And do you think premium online video will adopt OCR at a different pace than non-premium? And would it impact those targets? Does that make any sense?","Jamere Jackson","Yes. I'll take the first -- I'll take a shot at the first part of your question, which is around Ad Solutions. So we've said that, that business is -- was about a $200 million business. As you've seen from us in the first couple of quarters of the year here, we said that the business is growing at the low end of double-digits. We saw that again here in the second quarter. So we feel very good about where we are as a business. This is a key competitive advantage for us as we link our Watch assets and our Buy assets. And based on where we are in the back half of the year, we continue to see that kind of growth.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","And David, I'll take your second question about OCR with regard to video and whether we would anticipate a bifurcation between premium and non-premium. Ultimately, I think that will get decided by the marketplace. What we can deliver to the marketplace is a metric that performs well across a broad spectrum of the marketplace's needs, and that's the kind of response that we're getting right now from the marketplace. Ultimately, whether OCR gets used and adopted at different rates for premium video versus non-premium, it is going to depend on a lot of things that are outside of Nielsen's control. And our role is to simply measure the consumer and to do that in the most complete way across all delivery platforms, across all advertising models and across all business models, and let the market decide the direction it wants to go from there. And so that's the way we do that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you talk about your relationship with Google and how that's been progressing?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes. Thanks. This is a great story for us, a good news story in just about every way. As we communicated on our last earnings call, Google was slated at that time to begin to accept OCR tags on its YouTube-preferred inventory as of May 1, and that happened. And then, as of July 1, that was expanded to ads across all Google platforms, all Google properties, not only in -- not just in North America, but also in a number of markets in the Asia-Pacific region. And so, we feel great about how this one's progressed. We're confident that Google will continue to benefit from the role that having independent third-party measurement plays and gaining confidence from advertisers that are important to their business.","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, keeping on the theme of international. Other than what you mentioned regarding Turkey, where else do you focus internationally for Audio?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","I'm sorry, say the last part of your question again?","Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","For Audio, for the Arbitron piece, where are you focused internationally?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Oh, I see, I see. Well, even before we had acquired Arbitron, we did have a radio audience measurement business in a handful of countries around the world. And so our first focus is, of course, when those audience measurement contracts come up for renewal, we're focused on winning that renewal process. And we've done that in a number of markets over the past few years. And then we leveraged the capability that we acquired through our acquisition of Arbitron, and then we continued to press into new markets. Now the way this audio audience measurement business tends to work in markets around the world is these contracts are multiyear contracts. And so they don't come up -- they don't all come up for a renewal every single year. And each year there's a handful that come up for renewal. We position ourselves against the ones that we think are the best opportunities. And then we're going to win more than our fair share of those going forward, and Turkey is a good example of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jamere, I'm going to ask you about the investment timing for the year. And obviously, we heard that you're reiterating full year margin guidance. I'm asking if any course or investments were accelerated into the second quarter. You gave a long list of areas of investments that all seemed sensible. I'm more asking about were they aggregated in the second quarter maybe because of new client wins in the Buy business that were shouted out? I'm just really asking kind of a cadence of investments as we get through the year.","Jamere Jackson","Yes, so the investments will be relatively steady. As we talked about, the investments in our developing markets, in particular, are ones that we're very pleased with. And you can see some of the early returns there with the growth that we're seeing in some of those markets. And we will continue to invest in a disciplined way to make sure that we're investing in those markets and going after the growth that's there. So the investment will be relatively stable. I wouldn't be date-certain about when there'll be an inflection point there. But what I will say is that we're vastly underpenetrated there, and we're going to continue to invest and expect to see the kind of returns that we're looking for.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I didn't quite catch that. So you're saying stable through the balance of the year, but I'm asking was there any acceleration of investments into the second quarter?","Jamere Jackson","So the only acceleration would have been around some of our new client wins, and those are things that we had planned for. But then in the back half of the year, you're going to see a more stable set of investments, mostly focused on what we're trying to do in the emerging markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Your information revenue was strong and certainly stronger than we were expecting in the quarter. Can you talk about what drove the acceleration versus the first quarter? Was it really more developing market-focused or are there other areas?","Jamere Jackson","So our information business in the first half has been very strong, and we've seen really steady progress there. A couple of dynamics. One is the developing markets have been very strong. Our clients are continuing to invest there. We're seeing better-than-average growth in the developing markets. And then the second dynamic is really around new client wins. And typically, when we get new client wins, that gives us some pretty good momentum. They tend to have a few more data needs upfront, and we get a little lift from that. So that's a little bit of the driver in the first half. But we feel very good about our progress up to this point, and we expect the business to continue to grow in the way that we've seen it in the past.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then separately on margins. I know that we can only see the reported EBITDA margin by segment, and there is an FX drag. But when I look at Watch, your margins were down about 40 basis points year-over-year, which is not something that we've seen recently. Is that a short-term function of investment? And should we expect expansion in the back half? And then similarly for Buy, margins were down about 120 basis points in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and they were down in the first quarter. The comparison does get easier, though, and so I'm wondering there if we should see more of a stabilization in margin on a year-over-year basis.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. First, on your question on Watch. So the Watch margins there were entirely due to the Arbitron delivery. So typically, in Arbitron, our highest-volume quarters and our highest-margin quarters are the first and the third quarters. And so what you saw in the Watch business was purely seasonality associated with the Arbitron deliveries. On the Buy business, it all goes back to what we said about our Buy strategy here. We feel very good about where we are. We're going to continue to invest for the long term. We feel very good about the progress that we're seeing to date and the early returns. And again, as I've said on a number of occasions, we're doing those investments in a very disciplined way. We've got a great track record of turning those into great returns. And so you'll continue to see that -- see us do that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I wanted to ask about your Watch division again as well. You just mentioned Google basically added some business with you as of July 1, and you mentioned that your mobile measurement -- Mobile OCR also basically kicked in, in July. You've had about a 1% step-up already in the growth rate, which I'm presuming, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm presuming has something to do with OCR and further Ad Solutions sales and so forth. I'm just wondering if we're in line for a further step-up now in Q3, given what seems to be some more business that's coming on. And then secondly and separately, and it's really just housekeeping, I just want to make sure the debt refinancing you just did, looks like it -- obviously reduces your interest expense, and you just brought down your guidance. Was that incorporated in your beginning-of-year EPS guidance? Or does that implicitly move your EPS target up a little bit for the year?","Jamere Jackson","So let me take the first one on the debt refi. That was included in our guidance. We had contemplated a number of moves. We said that we're going to be opportunistic about making those. So that's included in the guidance that we have laid out there. In terms of the growth rate of our Watch business as it relates to a number of things that you've laid out, we clearly have seen a pretty strong first half in our Watch business. I would say things like Ad Solutions growing double-digits and a digital business that gives us -- that's been doubling through the first half of the year, certainly, gives us a growth year Watch number, if you will. And so those are the key drivers there. I think our progress is going to be steady. We'll continue to see the same kind of momentum in the back half of the year. But at this point in the year, I wouldn't say that you should expect it to be materially different from what we've seen thus far.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to ask, if you wouldn't mind, just revisiting the Buy revenue question just a little bit more once again. Just trying to dissect it a little bit. So listen, winning new customers is fantastic. Congratulations. Wonder if there's any help you could give us to just sort of sort out how much that -- those new customer wins contributed proportionally to your revenue growth, just so we can think about sort of the underlying rate of growth. And then separately and equally important, Europe, and how that influenced the growth and nongrowth. I heard you say it was in line with expectations. I think you said expectations were basically flat year-over-year, if you can just confirm that. And I have a follow-up.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So from a Buy standpoint, one of the things that we've talked about on the first quarter call that we've had some new clients. And as those new clients come on, they tend to -- as they're ramping up, they tend to have additional data needs. Sometimes it's historical data sets, et cetera. And so occasionally, when you have those new clients come on, you get a little bit of lift early on in that relationship, and then it sort of normalizes. So that's part of the momentum that we've had in the first half of the year. The other thing that we've seen and that we've experienced as it relates to Buy is that the investments that our clients are making in the developing markets has been relatively steady. And so the number that you see us talking about in the developing markets has been at a 9% number, certainly gives us some lift on that Buy number. So overall, we feel pretty good about where we are at this point and what we expect that to be.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Let me just add a comment on the developing markets side of the growth there, again, broad-based growth and broad-based in terms of our portfolio, but also just as importantly, broad-based in terms of the clients that we serve. It's not just the multinationals, but as you've heard from us before, it's also the local companies in these markets who continue to perform well and win share from the global companies in their own business, and then that strengthened their business, gets reflected back in the work they're doing with us. And so the strength across the breadth of our client portfolio and the breadth of our product portfolio really playing well in the developing markets for us these days and gets reflected in that 9%-plus growth that you saw for the quarter.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. And a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Listen, as a company that knows more about market share than anybody else, I'm sure you measure your own market share. I'm wondering, on the Watch side, specifically the OCR side, if there's any metrics you could share with us just in terms of your progress there relative to the overall market. And if you have some sort of shares statistic of what percentage of that business you think Nielsen is capturing.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, Todd, we always talk about the importance of independent, third-party measurement for market share. And of course, that would not be us on this particular question. So you got to start there. But it's not just about market share. We look at this as a market that is in and of itself developing. And that's really what our focus is on, is the market, not the competitor. And so we're taking that bigger approach and hoping this market develop. And we've got to measure the consumer wherever, however, whenever the consumers consuming content. That's what drives us, and that's what's going to drive the size of this market and the size of our share or role in it going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question, I know it's early going and it was just announced recently, but could you provide any additional color on what we should actually expect from your recent deal to launch the Omni Channel with Alibaba, like either how it works, the timing or economic impact and what the go-to-market is, whether it's project-based or subscription-based, what it looks like, et cetera?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, you're right, it is early going, and it's something that the clients in the marketplace are still getting their arms around, figuring out what it means for their business. And so it's a new -- this is a new area for the marketplace in terms of how they're doing business. It's a new area for us in terms of measurement as well. So yes, there's not a whole lot of additional details we can provide in terms of Omni Channel. I think it's pretty straightforward. It's bringing these 2 views of off-line and online sales together in an apples-to-apples way so people can understand their market share, not just in those 2 respective areas, but on a total-market basis. Then I think what that does is it informs people about how they want to allocate their resources and where they want to put their priorities in terms of how they market their brands going forward. And then that will probably open up second- and third-level opportunities for us in that particular part of our business. So this is one of the key things we're doing with e-commerce in the China market. There's additional things that we're also focused on and working on. And we're looking forward to sharing more details on some of those additional things in the future.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then a quick follow-up on the client win in Turkey in radio. A similar question or anything on the timing or impact on the numbers? And are there any other major contracts that you expect to be bidding on, either this year or next, as we know those are long-term deals?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, look, we did mention Turkey because it's going to have a huge impact on our revenue. It's a good one. We like it. But we mentioned it more because it was part of our rationale for the Arbitron deal, and we wanted to just give an update on delivering on that part of several rationale that we had for that deal in the first place. So Turkey and then as I mentioned, we also renew our radio audio measurement contracts in a number of other markets around the world, 2 that happened earlier this year, for instance, Malaysia and the Philippines. As far as other ones that come up, we're not going to share a bunch of information about other wins that come up. We'll update you, though, once those things come on board and they're part of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Attribution has been quite a buzzword among the ad tech and digital media companies in the last while, Google and Adometry, and AOL and Convertro. I was wondering if you see these companies' efforts as comparative or more complementary at this point in time, given that it's really hard to do attribution without TV-based measurement at minimum? And second question, just a bit of a follow-up to Dave's earlier question on Mobile OCR, specifically. Given that it seems that it's unlocking a lot of new inventory, making it interesting to big brands, have you seen any new customers at all? Even -- maybe it's not material financially, but I'm curious if there are new publishers in the mobile environment sort of signed up for you?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, let me take your first question first on what we sometimes refer to internally as MTA or multi-touch attribution modeling. It falls in the overall marketing ROI space or marketing effectiveness area. Ad Solutions would be another way to categorize within our business. And it is -- it's a hot item. It's a very exciting capability for clients. It addresses an incredibly important business need, trims waste out of the whole marketing process, helps them be more efficient and improves the return that they get on marketing spending. And the other thing that I think is so appealing about it is it's one of these analytical capabilities that is able to bring together the online or digital world and the traditional retailing world and do it in a way that's pretty powerful. So we've been very active in this area, and we have a lot of growth happening within our Ad Solutions area. That is tracing to multi-touch attribution modeling. Convertro, you mentioned, that was one of the firms. Yes, we see firms like this certainly as complementary. We work very closely with a number of them, and we'll continue to do that going forward. That's part of our open value here at Nielsen, and it serves us incredibly well. Your other question was about Mobile OCR, and you were asking if there were additional clients coming on board, is that right, Brian?","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","That's right. Yes.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, we mentioned that we already have more than 100 clients who are using Mobile OCR. So you can imagine that it reflects a pretty broad base in the marketplace and the important players out there. Some of them, we also mentioned, were first-time OCR clients. And so those are the ones where the business model is primarily or even exclusively focused on mobile. And so what we have had available before wasn't really relevant to them. Well, now, Mobile OCR is right in their wheelhouse, and so they've come on board. Others are players that are playing across a platform, and so Mobile OCR more or less filled the gap that had existed for them previously. So we have a mix within that list of clients that we mentioned, more than 100 already. And we're going to see more come on board in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, 2 questions for Jamere. You may have touched on this, as the line was sort of breaking up a little bit. The -- what is -- is the pro forma growth and profitability for Watch similar to the pro forma revenue growth, given the fact that margins were sort of flattish? That's question one.","Jamere Jackson","So the pro forma -- your question was, is the pro forma EBITDA in line with the revenue growth?","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, on a pro forma basis.","Jamere Jackson","So we haven't broken out the EBITDA for stripping out the impact of acquisitions. We're -- we've been hard at work at sort of wiring the 2 businesses together, and it gets increasingly difficult to sort of split out the margins associated with that. What I will say overall is that we're getting very similar kind of margin performance from our Watch business, as we've historically gotten, and the operating leverage associated with it is pretty good. And the synergies associated with the Arbitron business are certainly contributing to the Watch margins there.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, because it -- I mean, it looks like Arbitron had a very strong quarter. And then the second question is on the adjusted EBITDA, it looks like there's a $51 million add-back on nonoperating expense. I know there's a $45 million item in the reported earnings. What -- can you just elaborate on what that is?","Jamere Jackson","So we had the $45 million from the extinguishment of the long-term debt. That was in the numbers. And then while we're at it, if you just want to hit all of the kind of the nonrecurring, we had about $13 million of restructuring, $13 million of onetime items associated with a couple of settlements, little bit on foreign currency and a little bit of other. So that just kind of breaks it all down for you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So you'd mentioned that Ad Solutions was running about $200 million and growing in the low double-digits. The -- I wanted to ask the OCR revenue and growth rate. And then, also, when you fully anniversary-ed the displacement of net ratings and start to see that growth flow through completely.","Jamere Jackson","Yes. So we haven't broken out the OCR revenue at this point. It's still in the tens of millions. When we get to a number where we think we've got critical mass, we'll certainly start to share that. We're in the early innings of this market. We're very, very pleased with our progress. As Mitch indicated, the launch of mobile and the new clients that we signed up give us a lot of excitement around the business, and that we hope to break that out for you soon when we get to a number that has a critical mass of revenue associated with it. But we feel very good about where it is. And again, as we said, our digital business through the first half of the year has doubled.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to -- Jamere mentioned the softness at some of the U.S. clients late in Q2. I just want to ask your thoughts on Insights' growth for the remainder of the year.","Jamere Jackson","So as I mentioned, we did see some tightening with some of our North American clients. You probably have read some of the rhetoric from several of our clients as they look into the U.S. market in particular. As I said, that tends to manifest itself for us in -- sometimes our clients will tighten spending a little bit on additional data sets or tighten spending a little bit on certain categories. And as you know, our Insights business also is the lumpier, more discretionary piece of the business. And over time, that may impact that as well. Again, at this point in the year, we've seen it. We're watching it very closely, and we're watching it very closely in the back half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah. My first question is just on mobile ad measurement. You saw really strong adoption this month, which was encouraging to see. I'm wondering if you can offer any other milestones we should be looking for as mobile measurement is included in TV ratings later on this year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, that will be a big event. It will build off of what we've already done in the marketplace, bringing Mobile OCR out there and there's a number of other things that have to happen, some of which are incumbent on the -- that require actions by the marketplace. I think when you see the marketplace start to embrace the mobile television measurement and it starts to show up in the currency metric that's out there, and then it will play probably more heavily as we go into 2015 and the upfront process renews itself in the early part of 2015, you'll start to -- because then, by that time, the market will have had some experience with it. They'll see it in the numbers. They'll have some confidence with it, and then it will play a bigger role as they start to plan their business in the following year. So our focus right now is to get it out in the marketplace and let the marketplace start to get some experience with it.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one other question. You had cited Buy strength driven by new client wins. I'm wondering if you can give some insight into the profile of these clients, their general size, industry. And also, on the developing market strength, can you pare down how business trends have fared year-over-year and sequentially for the multinationals versus locals?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","I'm sorry, say that last part again about multinationals and locals, you're asking what?","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","How have their growth trends fared, say, year-over-year? Have they increased? Have they been stable, and on a sequential basis as well?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Okay. Well, first, on your first question. We talked about Mars on a previous earnings call, might have been when we reported fourth quarter for 2013. And there are other client wins that will come through. We're not going to broadcast all of them, but you can be sure that when the big multinational clients make a move like this, we're always excited about it. It always means a lot in terms of mobilizing resources to serve these clients in a more complete and global way, and it opens up opportunity for us, and that's certainly been the case with Mars, and it will be the case for the other ones that we win going forward. The other question again, remind me. Sorry.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just how growth trends have fared for multinational year-over-year versus locals?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Oh, yes, multinationals and locals, yes. Well, in some of these key developing markets, for the last, I'd say, the last year or 2, the local companies have been gaining market share against the multinationals, and everybody knows it. The local companies, for instance, if you go to Southeast Asia or you go to China, if you go to India, the local companies generally outperforming the multinationals, and the local companies know it, and the multinationals know it, too. And they're all digging into it to try to understand why that's happening and learn from it, and then make adjustments to their business models. The general consensus seems to be that the local companies are just more agile, more nimble. They're innovating more quickly, and they're driving more top line growth and winning market share from the multinationals who have been more leaning into scale and efficiency gains than they have been into focusing on agility and innovation. And so I think you'll start to see the multinationals respond to that impact that has occurred to their business, and it will start to level itself out, would be my guess. And you know what, Nielsen's in a good position no matter what happens in the marketplace because of our balanced client portfolio and the fact that we serve all of the clients, and in fact, the entire market. And so we look forward to helping everybody and helping the entire market move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Ryan Leonard filling in for Manav. Just want to follow up on Alibaba. Just want to know, I guess, kind of financially, are there any costs associated with kind of opening up a deal like this? And then strategically, what does this mean to kind of some of the conversations that you've mentioned that you've been having with other e-commerce providers and what kind of strength does it give you on those discussions?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, when you're serving clients, you're always going to have costs. And right now, though, the picture is more about the long-term opportunity here, not the short-term impact, whether it's the revenue or the cost in the short term. It's really the longer-term play, as more and more consumers want to purchase the goods for their household and for their daily lives on e-commerce platforms. Again, our commitment is to measure the consumer. And so we go where the consumer goes. We measure what the consumer does. E-commerce is a very important part of the future, by all indications. And so we're thrilled with this relationship we have with Alibaba on Omni Channel, and we'll continue to focus on that, and we'll invest in it appropriately. However fast it develops and however consumers decide to behave, then we'll be there with the right amount of investment at the right time to make sure that we're in sync with the evolution of the marketplace. In terms of other e-commerce players, yes, we're active in e-commerce not just in China, but in a number of markets around the world. Yes, including here in the U.S. And you're probably wondering about Amazon. Amazon is a great client for us, and we continue to work with them in a number of areas of their business. And yes, of course, we would like to be doing more with them. But whether it's Amazon or whether it's any other client for that matter, it almost always comes down to 3 things: first, aligning with the client's priorities; second, providing value against those priorities; and then, finally, persuading the client that you've done those first 2 things, which is important. That #3 is important. So we're working to do just that with Amazon, and we're working to do it in as many areas of their business as we can.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up. A lot of news recently about consolidation in both the consumer space and more lately, U.S. media. Can you just comment on the impact of consolidation across Watch and Buy?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Yes, sure. Thanks for asking. Look, we watch that closely, first and foremost, because these are our clients. And so we always need to know what's happening with our clients and what the issues are that they're facing. But as far as our business, we don't expect a material impact on our business from this industry consolidation that is being discussed in the press. Look, on the one hand, there looks like there's industry consolidation in one part of the market, but don't forget, there's also media fragmentation happening all across the market. And so you have some parts that are consolidating, other parts that are sort of being pulled apart. Through all of that movement, here's what we focus on: We focus on measuring the consumer. We're confident of the role that independent third-party measurement like what we provide. We'll continue to play an important and central role in the way the market operates, and we remain focused on doing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to revisit a couple of questions that were asked earlier. So because of the tightening, would you expect Insights' sort of organic revenue growth the back half of the year will be a little bit less than the first half? And also going back to the comments on Watch. Because you've, I think, cycled the discontinued online products and obviously, mobile's being rolled out, would you expect Watch organic growth to be a little bit better in the back half of the year because of mobile and the cycling of that discontinued product?","Jamere Jackson","So first of all, we've sort of reaffirmed our overall guidance ranges, and we expect to be within those ranges in the back half of the year. Given where we are in the year and given some of the dynamics that we're seeing, again, we've had great momentum in the first half of the year. We're seeing clients invest in the developed and the developing markets. What you potentially would see would be maybe some toggling between info and insights. But overall, our second half is going to line up in such a way that we'll be within the guidance range that we have, and it won't have a huge impact on us until it totally materializes. I would say, the other thing, is our second half Buy clients that we're adding won't have any impact until 2015 or so. So those are kind of the dynamics there. We're comfortable with the ranges that we put out, and the geography may move around a little bit between the pieces. But overall, we feel very good about what we've said.","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Insights is always the choppier side of our business. You've heard that before, you'll continue to hear that, and it's just because it's true. And so the good news is we have the majority of our business in the information area. That's one of the reasons why we have this steady, consistent business model that rides through cycles. And the big opportunity for us continues to be to bring the measurement part of our business in the analytics or inside -- insight part of our business together, to make sure those are linked as closely and as deeply as they possibly can be, so that those things start to move more together and they're more integral from a client perspective. And that's something we're going to continue to be focused on for the short term, medium term, long term, because they're such great opportunity for us right there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask, are there any commonalities that you can talk about in terms of what's driving the new client wins? And what I'm wondering is, are new products like Global Track Complete moving the needle? Is it now that you have complete global coverage or just any commonalities that's driving the wins?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","On Global Track Complete, this is a business issue that our clients have long had. It's just incredibly difficult to deliver on it. And we've done the hard work in the infrastructure of our company over the past several years that has put us in a position where we can now layer this capability, Global Track Complete on top of it, and finally deliver on something that our clients have wanted. And so that's point one. Point two is, clients are also changing the way that they run their business, the way they view their business, the way they manage and lead their business. And Global Track Complete, the capability it offers is perfectly in sync with that trend in our big global clients in terms of the way they operate. And so the 2 things really coming together is what's driven the evolution, the growth and development of Global Track Complete amongst our multinational client base. The commonality is they're global and that this is the way they approach their business. Not every global company runs its business out of regional or global level. Some still take more of a -- maybe call it a federated approach. But the ones who do want to have a big regional or a big global view, then they need that visibility on the KPIs, and the Global Track Complete delivers perfectly on that.","Jamere Jackson","Another angle on that as you think about commonalities is that, when you think about winning business with our big multinational clients, we've been very, very clear that our strategy in our Buy business is to be a global partner for global companies. And so what that means is we're in the marketplace and competing competitively. That commitment and that capability with things like Answers On Demand, Global Track Complete, investing in developing markets, plays very, very well as you're trying to win that business. So I think a key thread in all of this is that our commitment, our long-term commitment, what we've done in the marketplace really, really helps us.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I just want to actually ask a follow-up on that. How should we think about the framework for the pace of investment in Buy? Is it more along the lines that if you guys see a good opportunity to improve your competitive position with a good long-term payback, you're going to make that investment all day, regardless of the impact on near-term margins? Or is there also some sort of governor that you want to maintain at least a certain level of margin or limit year-over-year margin contraction to a certain level or something like that?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","On developing markets, look, we just had to keep going back to this idea of the long-term tailwind that exists in these markets. And it's driven by demographics, populations growing, populations also urbanizing, rising middle-class, rising disposable incomes. And so this is something that will continue to unfold over the next couple of decades. And so our investment will be in sync with that, with that long-term view, because we know where this one's going. There's nothing that's going to stop it. And we want to make sure that we serve those markets and that we win. We're the measurement provider. So we're going to invest according to that. We're going to do it responsibly and with discipline, but we're going to continue to do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Mitch, you spoke a little bit about it in your prepared remarks, and Jamere mentioned it again there as Answers On Demand. And can you just maybe -- we haven't heard a whole lot about it lately, just sort of refresh us on how you see its importance playing out strategically, where the client base there is, is it a little bit more something that helps you work into the mid-markets? And then lastly, just a more scalable platform like that, what -- how it could help you on the margin side over time and mix shift?","Dwight Mitchell Barns","Well, Answers On Demand, it's capability that we started developing several years ago and it's -- it was initially designed for our biggest global clients, the most sophisticated, the ones who are using the most complete breadth of our portfolio. So we designed it initially for them. It served us incredibly well for some of those biggest global clients. And what we've done now in recent times is we've started to make that capability in a form and make it available, of course, to a broader range of our client portfolio. And we're excited about the adoption that we've seen and this milestone that we've crossed in the second quarter of the year. The idea is that this provides the information in our broad portfolio of capabilities to our clients. They have direct, efficient, immediate digital access from their desktop. It's really as simple as that. But just given the breadth of our portfolio, that's easier to say than it is to do. And ultimately, it just allows the client to use everything we have. And if they don't use it, then they can't realize value from it. And so this is important to our clients. It's important to Nielsen because of the value realization that it relates to. And of course, ultimately, it's important to our shareholders for the exact same reason.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time, and I'd turn the conference back over to our presenters.","Kathryn H.

And as we look into the second half of the year and beyond, we have continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute.","Looking at the second quarter, we had revenue growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. In Watch, second quarter revenues increased almost 6% on a constant currency basis including a 7.9% increase in audience measurement of video and text. Buy segment revenues grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by 8.9% growth in emerging markets, and just under 1% in developed markets. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.5% constant currency, reflecting our ongoing productivity initiatives, and our scalable business model. Adjusted net income per share grew just over 9% constant currency to $0.71.","Driving shareholder value for our balanced capital allocation strategy remains a key priority. While we continue to invest consistently in our future growth, we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders. And during the quarter, we continued our steady rhythm of share buybacks. And as of June 30, we still had approximately $550 million remaining under our existing authorization.","Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. On our last call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve and the great job our teams are doing and leveraging these changes as a means for progress. Historically, we've talked about change more frequently on the Watch side of the business, but in fact in both Watch and Buy, our teams are focused on continuously renewing and improving our products consistence to keep pace with changing client needs.","So let's spend a few minutes on this. In Watch, change continues to be driven by media fragmentation as consumers now have the ability to view content across more channels, devices, platforms and even time periods. That means more things to measure, which creates more opportunity for us. Our clients want us to measure all of it, TV, mobile, video on demand, over the top viewing, video, audio, text and want to see measures for each of these individually as well as combined into one metric and that's exactly what our Total Audience Measurement system does.","Bringing Total Audience Measurement to the market has not been easy. It's been a multi-year process and our teams have been executing extraordinarily well. We now have in the market, a comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement of all ads and content across all screens and platforms. We continue to work closely with our clients towards fully syndicated reporting of all key metrics.","But Total Audience is not just about measuring audiences, it's also about ensuring that our total audience metrics support the complete process of buying and selling media from planning to activation to assessing the return on the investment. Our Total Audience system underpins all three of these activities as the visual on the webcast slide shows.","The loop begins with our measurement data, feeding our advertising clients planning systems, helping them to find the right consumers based on demographics or behavioral segmentation as well as helping them to allocate their resources efficiently across platforms to reach their desired audience. From there the focus of the system turns to activation enabled by our 2015 eXelate acquisition and now delivered via the Nielsen Marketing Cloud.","So we enable advertisers to target specific audiences in a programmatic environment and to activate their buy through the eXelate pipes that go directly to ad servers. The next step is to measure effectiveness. How well did the ad reach the target audience? What effect did the ad have on the brand? What was the sales lift? What was the ROI on the media spend?","This is a continuous cycle, plan, activate, measure, then repeat. This is the process that our Total Audience Measurement system supports. With that in mind, I'll mention a few highlights that illustrated the recent progress we've made on our strategy. In the second quarter, our national TV business remained rock solid. While our data showed that the average U.S. adult is watching three minutes less of linear television compared to last year, it's still over 4.5 hours per day. With the broadest reach television remains a critical component for brand building campaigns.","Meanwhile digital advertising with its promise of precision, continues to grow at a double-digit pace, that's despite the recent industry concerns related to digital advertising fraud and viewability that appeared to have slowed down the shift in spend from traditional media. For us, wherever the advertising dollars flow, we'll be there to measure the audience.","Last week, we announced that we've integrated three leading providers of viewability metrics, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat into our digital ad rating system, making it much easier for our clients to know the delivery of viewable impressions to their target consumers.","Another highlight in the quarter for digital ad ratings relates to Hulu. In May, Hulu announced that they are partnering with us to use our digital ad rating system to measure living room impressions delivered over the top through connected TV devices, such as Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation or Smart TVs. 70% of Hulu's viewing now occurs on connected TV, whereas earlier in their existence, nearly all Hulu viewing took place on a PC. This serves as yet another example of why our clients need a total audience view of a changing market.","We continue to see strong demand of our measurement of subscription video-on-demand. With 52% of households now subscribing to a subscription video-on-demand service, audience data is more valuable than ever to studios and content owners seeking to fully monetize their programs for this growing audience.","Late in the second quarter, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, we unveiled screening ratings for the Lions Gate production of Orange is the New Black. The fourth seasons' premier episode was watched by 6.7 million people in the U.S. This is comparable to the second most viewed cable drama on TV behind HBO's Game of Thrones. This is valuable information for studios as they look to monetize their content.","On digital content ratings, our release of syndicated data to participating clients occurred in late May on schedule and we've remained on track to syndicate total content ratings for participating clients in August. We have a strong pipeline of additional clients, both big media and digital natives, integrating the SDK that enables this measurement. Exciting to see how these new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways audiences are consuming content.","For example, what's recorded on a DVR and watched a month later. But did the consumer view it through their cable providers' video-on-demand service, or was viewed over-the-top via a Roku streaming player. This level of granularity helps our clients align their strategy with their audiences' viewing habits.","Regarding the effort to update the currency data used to plan and measure advertising. In June, we've had yet another positive and productive meeting with key industry stakeholders. Clients continue to be supportive of Total Audience and are engaged in moving the industry toward a new rating standard in time for their 2017 upfront negotiations.","Internationally, we remain on track to have Digital Ad Ratings in 25 countries by year's end and we recently confirmed contract extensions for our TV Audience Measurement Services in Australia and Sweden.","Finally, last quarter we mentioned our agreement with DISH Networks to license their set top box data supporting our local and national TV rating services. This quarter we're pleased to announce that we recently reached agreement with Charter Communications to license their set top box data, further extending our coverage. Both of these data sets will help strengthen our TV measurement products as well as help fuel our marketing effectiveness analytics.","Speaking of marketing effectiveness, we had another strong quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 15%. As a reminder this is where we help clients plan, activate and evaluate the return on their media investments.","The Nielsen Marketing Cloud brings all of these capabilities together in one system. It's off to a great start in the U.S. and in June we launched our cloud system in Europe. This is a dynamite part of our business and it has a lot of runway.","Shifting to the Buy business similar to the Media world, the fast-moving consumer goods industry has also seen fragmentation driven by new channels and shifting consumer purchasing behavior. Adapting to this changing environment, we're focused on providing both manufacturer and retailer clients with a complete view of consumers, with whether they buy in store, out of home or online. Our focus here is on coverage, we call it Total Consumer Measurement analogous to Total Audience Measurement in our Watch business.","Our investments in coverage in the emerging markets continue to be a significant growth driver. In the second quarter, our growth was fueled by both local and multinational clients as well as steps we've taken to strengthen our portfolio through innovation. Retailer clients are another important part of our Buy growth strategy, as the growing role of technology for consumers, retailers and manufacturers is changing the path to purchase.","At the end of June, we launched our Brandbank capabilities in the U.S. This has been a very successful business for us in Europe, and we're excited about the U.S. launch. Recall that Brandbank is focused on supporting retailers and their e-commerce product content needs. As an example, Brandbank can now connect directly to Walmart systems as an approved content service provider, supporting Walmart's omni-channel strategy. For our manufacturer clients, Brandbank will collect, manage, and submit content on their behalf aligned with Walmart's requirements for data attributes and formats.","During the quarter, we also welcomed Whole Foods to our retail client roster, leveraging our market share data and analytics. We're helping them build on their strength with natural and organic products as they double down on consumer-centric category management. Health and wellness is of growing importance to many of our manufacturing clients and our work with Whole Foods, adds to our ability to help them drive growth in these product segments.","When we look at the developed markets, the environment continues to be challenging. In the absence of strong top-line growth, our clients are looking to find efficiencies in their business, which in some cases includes their marketing, sales or innovation processes. One action, we took in the quarter was to realign our Buy business globally into clusters of countries with similar market characteristics. We also accelerated our investments in our Buy business's connected system, which will enhance the value and speed we bring to our clients.","I'll spend a few minutes on this connected system. Our business is focused on measuring and improving performance for our clients. Understanding what is happening is the first step. We answer this with our measurement of sales and market share. Once our clients know what happened, the next question is why: what were the key drivers of the results? Our analytics will automatically pinpoint the key drivers including marketing and sales activities, competitive activity, and market trends. Then the most important question is what next? What does the brand need to do to improve?","These are all capabilities that we have in the market today, but our opportunity is to make them more valuable for our clients by connecting them into one fully integrated system, a system underpinned by one source of truth that enables more speed and efficiency for Nielsen, and more importantly, for our clients. That's what our connected system will do.","Clients have been enthusiastic in their feedback and they want it now. And that's the key reason why we've accelerated the pace of our investment in this platform-based connected system. We'll begin with an initial group of clients who will be on board by the end of the year, with more transitioning through 2017. A faster, more efficient system, creates more value for our clients and bolsters our position as the leading global provider of measurement and analytics to the FMCG industry.","I want to close with a few words on corporate social responsibility. We know many long-term investors are putting more emphasis on this lately, and we agree with you. The way I often say it to our teams internally is that companies need to care for the communities they rely on for their business, our company lives this out in a variety of ways, focusing on education, nutrition, diversity and inclusion, and access to technology.","In May, we published our first global responsibility report, which describes our efforts in detail. One of our recent efforts was Nielsen Global Impact Day. On June 2, as part of our fifth annual Day of Service, over 23,000 Nielsen associates participated in more than 1,400 volunteer activities across 92 countries. I'm extremely proud of them for their commitment and their service.","So those are my comments on the quarter. We're looking forward to the rest of the year with continued confidence and excitement about the progress to come.","Over to you, Jamere.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mitch. We had another solid quarter reflecting the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model, which continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.","First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side of the page, our results on U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.4% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in both our Watch and Buy segments and offset partially by the impact of foreign exchange.","Net income was $114 million and net income per share was $0.31 which was flat versus the second quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by solid revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by restructuring charges related to the realignment of the market in our Buy segment.","Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 4.5% constant currency. We've delivered 40 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives.","Our Watch business grew 5.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 3.3% constant currency led by continued strength in the emerging markets.","Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million, up 6.5% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.7% up 60 basis points on a constant currency basis, with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments.","Our productivity pipeline remained strong and we're confident in our guidance of 50 basis points to 70 basis points of constant currency margin expansions for the total company in 2016.","Adjusted net income was $257 million up 6.6% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.71 up 9.2% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program.","Finally, we generated free cash flow of $98 million compared to $156 million in the second quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by working capital timing and CapEx investments in our growth initiatives in Watch and Buy and we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. Again, a solid quarter of consistent and steady results.","Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. The first is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $744 million up 5.8% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well, as Audience Measurement of video and text was up 7.9% on a constant currency basis.","Audio was up nearly 2% constant currency while delivering solid margins and free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.1% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud and Nielsen Catalina Solutions products offerings. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness, continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we're seeing strong demand from both publishers and advertisers.","As expected Other Watch is about a 2 points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $332 million, up 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 24 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business.","Let me say just a few words about our key initiatives in Watch. First Total Audience has strong momentum, Digital Ad Ratings has been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns and in the second quarter Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 53% led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners.","Digital Constant Ratings which provide daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, we signed new digital platform clients such as Kik and Mashable","In addition, we've reached an important milestone with the successful release of syndicated data to participating clients. Our efforts to provide our clients with more capability and flexibility in measuring content and campaigns is a key growth driver for our business.","Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and marketing effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.","Turning to Buy, second quarter total Buy revenue was $852 million, up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $582 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis.","We saw modest growth in core measurement offset by softness in discretionary spend. We are continuing to invest by realigning our market clusters and accelerating the development of our Connected System which will enable us to create a faster growing higher margin business in the developed markets.","Our business in the emerging markets was $270 million, up 8.9% on a constant currency basis. In the emerging markets, growth was broad-based with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with high single-digits in Eastern Europe and India.","Buy EBITDA was $166 million, up 6.4% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 57 basis points on a constant currency basis in the quarter. And this is the eighth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as emerging markets continue to scale, and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. We remain confident in our 2016 Buy guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.","Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 210 basis points drag on revenues, and 140 basis point drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call.","The current spot rates held constant through 2016, and we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and an 80 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly worse than the forecast we gave last quarter.","Moving to 2016 guidance, we are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out at the beginning of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 a share, and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.","So, to wrap up, overall, we had another quarter of consistent, steady revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, we are remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Amy.","Amy Glynn - Vice President, Investor Relations, Nielsen Holdings Plc","Thanks Jamere. Erica, we're ready for a Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And, your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Jamere, could you tell us about the organic constant currency revenue growth in Watch and overall and where do you see, kind of the trajectory going forward for organic Watch?","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thank you, Andrew. So, I'll start with the total company. So, our revenue was 4.5% on a constant currency basis. That was about 4.1% on an organic basis. So 40 basis points of inorganic contributed to revenue. We got about 90 basis points of lift from the NCS and then 50 basis points drag from NRG. So that comprises about 40 basis points for the total company.","And in Watch, 5.8% constant currency that was 4.9% organic. We had about 2 points of lift from NCS, and about 110 basis points of drag from NRG. We feel confident about our performance through the first half of the year and as I said, we're maintaining our guidance for Watch for the total year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I have don't have anything to add to that. Thanks for the question, Andrew, but I just wanted to say to everybody on the call, thanks for your patience as we started with that rather humorous opening. It wasn't intentional but hopefully you all got a good laugh out of it. So, next question operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Cary, from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Can you provide a little more color on the trends in the Buy business particularly in developed regions? It seems like the 90 basis points of constant currency growth in developed is the slowest we've seen in a number of quarters. I know you called out more pressure on discretionary spending trends in the quarter, but is there anything else worth calling out? And as we look to the full year, should we expect, should we still expect that 1.5% to 3.5% growth?","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Ryan. So clearly we're in a two-speed world where our clients have seen slower growth in the developed markets for some time now, while the emerging market growth has been fairly robust despite some volatility and uncertainty.","For Nielsen, the U.S. and Europe represents over 85% of our developed markets. Europe actually saw a modest growth in core measurement, while the discretionary side was a little soft as was in the U.S. And, I'll just remind you that discretionary spending can be a little lumpy. We're coming off two stable quarters, so it's not uncommon to see these dynamics from time to time. And in the second half, I expect developed Buy to be within the range we gave at Analyst Day of 1.5% to 3.5%.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Jamere, your free cash flow in the first half was about $112 million. In order to hit the $950 million of guidance for the year I think you have to do about 30% better in the back half year-over-year. So, if you could just give us a few points on what's going to drive the year-over-year improvement that'd be helpful. Thank you so much.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, here's the way I'd frame it. We generate over 80% of our free cash flow in the back half of the year. So this year will be no different. Relative to the last year, spending on our growth initiatives is actually up in the first half and that's for areas such as the Connected Buy system, the Nielsen Marketing Cloud and set-top box integrations. Our working capital initiatives will kick in, in the back half of the year and these are things that will keep us on track for the full year plan.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. I'd like to turn to the Watch segment if I could, and just talk a little bit about the book of business with your traditional sort of core national TV network clients who are on long-term agreements. And, anything you can tell us about sort of the cadence of the renewal of those agreements over the next, even five years like how they roll through?","And then for \u2013 I'm sure you've had some renewals recently and so anything you could tell us about the nature of those discussions, what clients are pushing you on and probably most importantly, do you come out of there with revenue growth rates over the life of the contracts that are similar to past rates, faster, slower? Anything you can provide on (28:25) that would be great. Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Hi, Todd. Thanks for the question. Well, I mentioned in my opening comments that our national TV business remains rock solid, and while television isn't the only thing that those clients that you've referred to are focused on, it's still the biggest part of their business, and so it's still the center piece of those contract renewals. But as we said in previous quarters, when we've updated this group on how those contract renewals are going, and increasingly the conversation is around our Total Audience Framework. They want to know how we're going to measure television, but also how we're going to measure their content, audiences for their content across all these additional screens and platforms where their content is now viewable by consumers.","And you see that reflected, as you would expect, in the structure of our contract renewals these days, and increasingly so, as time goes on and Total Audience becomes more used and more real in the marketplace. So that's the change in the texture of those contracts and those contract discussions. We though continue at the same time be very pleased with the terms of those contract renewals; length of the contracts fairly in line with what's historically been the case and then the terms in terms of the annual increases in price also are fairly well in line. What's different is the breadth of measurement that our service will provide. If you go back many years, it was all about television and that's very much not the case today. It's now all about video and wherever that video content happens to be viewed.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get some insight on your recent set-top box integrations. I know you've said deals will be more focused on expanding coverage than share quantity. Could you give us a sense of what your perspective is on coverage now that you've got a couple of providers, perhaps, you know, how far are you from full coverage and as you add more providers, what's your perspective on margin expansion in the Watch segment? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Anj. We were pleased with DISH that we announced last quarter because of course DISH is a service that's available to consumers nationally, and so it gives us that breadth. And, Charter gives us a little bit more depth in certain parts of the country where Charter is the provider to markets and communities; cities, states, communities out there. We're going to continue to look for additional providers to add into the mix.","The good news is we don't need them all. And as we talk with the additional options, the other companies who have set-top-box data available, yeah, we're going to continue to look at them as almost pieces to a puzzle. And, we need to look for the best configuration, not just, as you referenced the biggest quantity of data. So, DISH is a great start, Charter is a fabulous addition. We're looking to add one or two more in the quarters ahead and we'll be sure to keep this group updated on our progress on that front.","But already, even where we stand right now, we're happy with what we are going to be able to do with these two existing data sets, in terms of both bolstering our national and local television audience measurement products as we look out into next year and beyond, as well as using these data sets to help drive our marketing effectiveness business, which continues its very strong double-digit growth quarter-after-quarter. So, yeah, we love the direction we're going.","As far as margins, one thing we mentioned on prior calls is while on the one hand licensing these set-top-box data sets is a new expense in our budget. On the other hand, it also helps relieve some of the long-term pressure on our panels. They won't have to bear as much of the weight, if you will, when the market requires additional granularity and they're calling for us to increase the size of our panels.","Increasing our traditional panels, that's a very expensive thing to do. And so by bringing these big data sets from the set-top box data providers into the mix for our measurement service, we don't have to increase the size of our panels as much going forward as we otherwise would have. And so, that avoidance of future cost helps offset the cost of licensing set-top box data as we bring it into the picture.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you could talk a bit about your acquisition of Repucom. I was curious if you could talk specifically (33:13) any details of the revenue profile. And maybe broader about the sponsorship business and how much your total business across Nielsen is focused on tracking sponsorship?","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is one that we're very excited about. So the Repucom business actually is focused in two areas: one is measurement in video of logos for both brands and for sports teams and franchises. And, the reason this is important is because there is an important trend that's also happening as it relates to native advertising. So in essence what these guys are doing is native advertising related to sports, and in sports that is the measurement of logos and signage. In addition to that they provide sponsorship valuation and analytics to teams and leagues and right holders \u2013 rights holders.","Sports is a big business, the combination of media rights, sponsorships and analytics is a big business that we're very interested in from an analytics standpoint. What we've seen in our data inside the company is that 93 of the top 100 live TV events were sports and that was up from probably 14 or 15 just a few years ago. And this is an opportunity for us to connect our Total Audience data and drive tremendous value for our clients. So, an important contribution and an important add to the Nielsen profile. The revenue profile for this year will not be that meaningful in terms of its overall contribution to the Watch revenue, but this is an important capability for us going forward and we look forward to it being a growth driver for us.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I will add to this one is, we also really like the team that's built the Repucom business over the years, very strong team. They have a global footprint already and we look to help them extend that global footprint even further on the back of our global infrastructure. So we see a lot of runway on this one.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. Are the $100 million a year numbers I've seen faked (35:12) around the revenue profile, is that accurate?","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","So, the $100 million number is actually a little spicy. You got to remember a couple of things.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","One is that we have an existing sports based audience measurement business today that, this obviously will cannibalize a little bit of that. And then also Repucom is currently buying ratings from Nielsen. So, when you put it in the mix, the contributions to Nielsen's overall revenue will be much less than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you, good morning. A question on margins and how to think about the back half of the year. I'm wondering if you expect Watch margins to still be up on a year-over-year basis in the back half. And then in Buy, should we expect faster margin expansion year-over-year in the back half than we saw in the first half?","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, we're focused on the total company margin expansion number; we gave guidance of 50 basis points to 70 basis points. We've had pretty good progress this year. One of the things that we've said at Analyst Day and it's certainly playing out in the numbers, is that Buy is going to be a bigger contributor to the margin numbers this year and you've seen that through the first half of the year.","And there's two drivers there, number one, the emerging markets are continuing to scale, we're starting to get more margin calories out of our emerging market business. And then, our prototype productivity pipeline is pretty strong, we actually have about 4,000 projects across both Watch and Buy that are going from a productivity standpoint and the team's been doing a fantastic job executing on those.","So, our focus will be on driving the margin expansion in the total company. We expect a positive contribution from both Watch and Buy in the back half of the year.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Margin expansion, Sara, the scalability of our business model is almost always the first thing that we mention. But I just don't want to give short shrift to the productivity efforts of our teams. They start every year with a focus on productivity and that's the big bill payer in our business as well as margin contributor. And it's just an incredible discipline that's been drilled into our company over the last decade or so. So that's a really important component of it and one reason why we remain confident, not only through the rest of this year but in 2017 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Mitch, I just wanted to revisit some of your comments from last quarter in terms of trying to see how all this progress and good stuff you're talking about translates into the trajectory of the revenue growth, maybe just focused on the Watch business for now. Clearly you're signing a lot of these digital first customers which I think will all be incremental revenue for you guys. So maybe a sense of, are they all sort of in beta stages, early penetration and how that should track over a particular timeline?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks, Manav. Good to hear from you. Look, we're very pleased in the quarter with the revenue growth we're seeing in the Watch side of our business, in particular with Audience Measurement of video and text. As we referenced that's up 7.9%. And while that's boosted in part by some of the acquisitions that we've made, the underlying organic growth component of that remains strong as well and just as you referenced that's reflective of both sides of our business, the traditional media companies, the media conglomerates.","Back to the question asked before. Our contract renewals with the big media companies remain solid and then the growth that we continue to see with the digital natives, where we're leveraging the different components of our Total Audience Measurement framework, Digital Content Ratings named the newest comer on the block, but Digital Ad Ratings being a really key component of that growth. These are the really key drivers. Jamere mentioned some of the progress we've made in the quarter with Digital Ad Ratings for example. Kik and Mashable coming on board.","We also saw international expansion with both Snapchat and Twitter. I mentioned Hulu leveraging digital ad ratings for over-the-top device viewing measurement, there is a number of other things happening on this front including one very important thing that we referenced briefly last quarter, but I'll just highlight it again which is the U.S.'s largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble went live with Digital Ad Ratings on July 1. And so that's a big milestone in our progress and we continue to be very strong with all the top U.S. advertisers.","So these things are growing at a very healthy rate and as the size of the Digital side of our business starts to gain more critical mass, it will be a bigger contributor to the overall growth of our Watch business going forward.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","I'll just add that through the first half of the year we're up 6% in our Watch business and just a few years ago, this is a business that was growing 3% to 4%. And so you're already seeing the impact of a growth year, Watch business, in our numbers. And so we're pleased with the progress through the first half of the year; gives us a lot of confidence going into the back half. But we're already seeing the benefits of all of the investments that we've made in Total Audience Measurement and that's showing up as a growth year Watch number than we had just three years or four years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone. One quick one on Watch and then maybe one with some extended thoughts from Mitch on Buy. The quick one on Watch, does the Charter deal include Time Warner Cable households? And then maybe, Mitch, your more broad thoughts on how the CPG industry is starting to see subscription models evolve a little bit more and how Nielsen plans to attack that over the next few years and how Internet of Things may play into that as well?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. Dan, on your first question regarding Charter, the agreement that we've reached recently with Charter is specific to the Charter part of the business. If we can expand it in the future to include their newly acquired Time Warner Cable franchise, obviously, we're interested in doing that. But so far, the focus has been on what has historically been the Charter Communications part of the business.","And the other question is a great one, on the Buy part of our business. In terms of CPG moving more to subscription models. There's still \u2013 there's a lot of things happening there. I assume what you're referring to by the way is subscription models in terms of how they provide their products to their consumers, Dan. So, if I'm misinterpreting that let me know. We have some really interesting things happening there and probably the one that's been most prominent in the news lately, is Dollar Shave Club, not that that's new, but of course Unilever has taken a lot of interest in Dollar Shave Club and acquired them for a pretty price tag from what I saw in the press.","So, that's one of the big trends that we see emerging. And, obviously Amazon, (42:23) that trend in part with \u2013 I think, they call it Amazon Dash and that allows consumers to have a button, a physical button in their household, where they can just press the button and it'll automatically reorder a product which is not purely a subscription model but it's certainly heading in that direction.","And I think more and more companies are going to be at least experimenting with this. I think the positive piece of this from my perspective, Dan, is the emphasis that it puts on branded goods in the marketplace. Because I think, one of the key struggles for the FMCG industry broadly is the growth of private label, which has abated somewhat in the U.S market in the last couple of years, but continues to grow in terms of its market share around the world. And this is obviously not good news for the big manufacturing clients that we work with whose businesses are built around brands.","So, subscription models really put a lot more emphasis on the importance of brands because you're going to sign up to be a continuous user of that product. Brand equity and brand attachment are probably going to be stronger magnet in that business model versus buying the product in a week-in, week-out by going to a grocery store where you might be lured away more by price.","So, we're interested to see how this unfolds. Our Total Consumer Measurement approach, that whole philosophy and the system and platform that underpins it, we'll be able to measure it either way because again part of the focus there is on coverage. And in the developed world the biggest coverage objective right now is all around e-com where a lot of these subscription models would show up. So that's going to be interesting. I love to see the FMCG industry experimenting with business models. I think it's healthy. If fact, I hope I see more of it going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, yes. Thanks. Just want to follow up on the comment or announcement as well as this quarter around the viewability and integration of a couple of different firms there. I guess can you talk about your thought process on why partner at this point and why not wanting to have that capability in-house or own it, I guess, yourself given it seems a critical topic right now for digital measurement?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks for the question. First, for those who may not have seen it, what we announced a couple of weeks ago is that we've moved to a much closer integration with three of the leading providers of viewability metrics to the marketplace. And the three are called DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat. And, what these firms do, is they measure whether, when an ad was served to a consumer, whether that impression resulted in the ad actually being viewable on the screen and what portion or for how long. And so that's what viewability refers to, as I'm sure many of you already know.","So what we done is we've integrated these three leading providers into our Digital Ad Ratings system in order to make that ability to see viewable impressions much more seamless, much easier for our clients. And we've gotten very good feedback on that announcement. We've integrated three, not just one because right now, this is still a very fragmented marketplace. There is quite a number of different providers of viewability metrics and so we felt it was important to give our clients a choice. And it's a big part of our philosophy to have as much openness to our platforms as we can to the extent that it serves the interests of our clients and so you see that reflected in these three. As you look forward, we'll keep an eye on this part of the market and we'll see how it continues to unfold, but right now we like this arrangement where we're partnering with these three leading providers. And, the feedback we've gotten from our clients says we've got it exactly right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin from Needham. Your line is open.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Maybe a couple. Mitch, could you talk about the competitive environment. For a while you were really neck-in-neck with your Total Audience and Total Content Rating with comScore. But, given their accounting issues, I'm wondering if you think a part of your robust growth in Watch is attributable to their, maybe, distraction. And then the second thing is, I was really intrigued by your early comments here, Mitch, where you said, digital advertising maybe, there's been a slowdown in the shift to digital platforms. And, the media dynamics data around the upfront and television would support that because it looks like there was a billion dollars added to the TV market in the upfront this year. So, I'm actually really, could you give us some more granularity given Nielsen's unique seat on this comment about how you think there might be a slowing shift of advertising to digital platforms. Thanks so much, guys.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure Laura. First on your question regarding competitive environment. We continue to love our competitive position, that's really what it all comes down to. We're focused on executing on our strategy. Total Audience Measurement, we love the feedback, we're getting from our clients in terms of that strategy being perfectly aligned with what they need and our teams have executed extraordinarily well. They've been hitting their milestones. As I mentioned earlier, we syndicated the reporting of Digital Content ratings on schedule. We are on track to syndicate reporting of Total Content ratings on schedule.","And I know that, if I go back a year or two ago, we talked about where we were going to go with Total Audience Measurement. There was a lot of skepticism around, okay, maybe the concept sounds good but will Nielsen really be able to deliver and well, we have. We have delivered and we're proud of that. Now, our work isn't done. We still have a lot more to do, but I think our execution is the key reason for the strength in our business right now. I wouldn't attribute it to anybody else's misstep or weakness, I really would attribute it to the strength of our execution and the fit with our strategy with what our clients really need. So, we feel great about that piece.","On your second question regarding this steep shift in the marketplace between traditional media and digital advertising. I think it is in part driven by these concerns around digital advertising fraud that includes non-human traffic and there's also a concern around blockers, but viewability seems to be the most prominent of all the concerns out there. And that's given some pause to people as they allocate their budgets going forward.","I also think another driver which I did not mention in my opening comments is just the re-acquaintance in the industry, advertisers in the industry, with the importance of reach. So, digital gives you incredible precision when you can get it right. But it's hard to get both precision and reach in a digital environment whereas television, while it may not offer the precision of the digital world, at least not yet, still is the best place to get reach. And if you're a brand manager and a brand builder you know that reach is still your first priority.","And so, I think, that re-acquaintance with the importance of reach is one of the reasons why we've seen, yeah that perceived shift, a little bit of slowing of the growth in digital and people still investing heavily in good old fashion television because it gets the job done. And there is a good ROI on that media investment.","So, again wherever they go, however the shift happens, if it accelerates in one area or if it moves back in another direction, one of the reasons why we love our Total Audience Measurement framework is because we cover it all. And we not only enable people to see these trends in shifts but we are able to connect it with a return and help them really drive the most efficient, most effective allocation of their resources, whether they're buying or whether they're on the sell side of this equation.","Operator","Your next question, comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning everyone. So, a question for you following up on our visit to the Innovation Center back in the middle of March. There was a lot of talk then about Operation 2020, automate, consolidate and accelerate. And the question is, how is that progressing and when do you think we'll start to see the revenue and margin benefit from the program?","And then also, will it ultimately be able to take the margin growth pace up from the current 50 basis points to 70 basis points a year that you are doing now?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Look, we're really pleased with the progress, we're making on those objectives that you outlined in your question. If I step back from it \u2013 the way I think about this is we have traditionally been very much, especially on the Buy side of our business by the way, and people with the service business model and more manually intensive in terms of creating and delivering and then helping our clients ultimately leverage our products, in particular our measurement products.","And that business has been a great business for a long time, but given the progress being made in the world around us with regard to technology and all the new capabilities made available, yeah that's where we see this opportunity to automate a lot of this delivery. And in concert with that as I mentioned with this connected system, also connect these great individual pieces of our portfolio into an integrated, interoperable system.","So by connecting our individual products into a system and then automating a lot of that delivery where our system connects directly into our client's systems, feeding directly their key business processes with our measurement data and with our analytics, you move from what has traditionally been much of a people as a service business model to more of a data as a service or software as a service business model, which of course drives efficiency and speed and agility everywhere you look.","And that's going to be beneficial to Nielsen and our shareholders and it'll also be beneficial to our clients, increasing the value of what we do and increasing the ability for us to help them drive growth and strengthen their business. So this is what we're focused on. And we've been making great progress on it. It's a multi-year process and we'll continue to provide updates on some of the key milestones as it unfold over the course of the next year or two.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think what you saw is what I often refer to is the fact that we're running the place with intensity around cost and productivity. And the initiatives that our teams are executing against give us a lot of confidence in that long-term margin framework of 50 basis points to 70 basis points. And what that also gives us the ability to do is to invest \u2013 to invest in the kinds of things that are going help us to create a faster growing, higher margin business in the future. So, the teams are executing extremely well and we're excited about the things that are in the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks and hope I didn't miss these in previous comments. But could you please \u2013 I just wanted to follow up on a couple things. The discretionary spending slowdown, if that's the right word in Q2, I think, Jamere, you were saying that was really just something of a blip and maybe there were some tough comps. Is this not something to worry about? And I would mention this because this has been an item to worry about in previous reporting periods for you.","And then, just another follow up; your restructuring in the \u2013 in the Buy division, is this an ongoing investment into the second half and is there any sort of sense of financial returns from this over time or is this really just a matter of making your processes more efficient?","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, just to reiterate my comments on the discretionary portion of the business, as I said. We saw modest growth in core measurement and the discretionary side was a little soft in the developed markets, both in the U.S. and the UK. What I've always reminded you of is that discretionary spend can be a little lumpy, we're coming off a couple of stable quarters. So, it's not uncommon to see these dynamics from time to time. And in the second half, we expect developed Buy to be within the range that we gave at Analyst Day, 1.5% to 3.5%.","In terms of the restructuring, we feel very confident that the things that we're doing from a restructuring standpoint in our Buy business do two things. One, it gives us fuel to invest and accelerate our investments in things like the Connected Buy system, but also gives us fuel for the margin expansion, long-term targets that we talked about of 50 basis points to 70 basis points. And the teams are executing very well against that and we're able to deliver on those restructuring programs and still grow our business and return margin back to the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thank you on the Connected Buy system, can you give us some of the key milestones or rough timeline? And I guess the $100,000 question, roughly when do you expect it to start more materially impacting Buy developed revenue in a positive way?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jeff, happy to \u2013 one of the key milestones in fact the next one I would point you to is that we plan to have initial group of clients on board this system at the end of this year. So, we'll keep this group updated on that progress, and then as we move through 2017 we'll begin to bring additional clients from our FMCG client base, both manufacturers and retailers onto this system as well.","And then as they come on to the system and then start to experience it, start to be able to run their businesses off of it, then the next thing that happens is those long-term contracts that are generally in place with our larger clients on that side of the business, as those contracts renew, they will start to be folded into the arrangements that those contracts describe and then that's how it starts to flow through into the financials for the Buy side of our business.","So, nothing is going to happen immediately in regard to the Connected system. This is a long-term initiative with a long-term timeline in terms of how it unfolds. And I think the perfect analogy is to look at the timeline and the process that you saw unfold on the Watch side of our business as we took on a very similar challenge, building a Total Audience Measurement system, which \u2013 it's been multiyear process, but now we're starting to see the delivery of the benefits of that in our financials.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. I want to know if you could maybe provide us a little more color on adoption levels and level of coverage for your SVOD solution and any plans that you have to improve that methodology you had talked about, using routers and some other technology. And then a small follow-on would be what else do you actually need to do to get the Syndicated Total Audience launch in August? Is it simply the passage of time or is there something else that you actually have to do to get it off the ground?","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andre. On Subscription Video On Demand measurement, looks like the market likes it pretty much. And the reason why I say that is if you go back several quarters, we were covering about 6,000 different program episodes and last quarter we highlighted the fact that the number had grown to 8,000 and then this quarter the number is now sitting in the neighborhood of 9,500 different program episodes. And the reason why I point to that growth in the number of program episodes is the way this measurement \u2013 this part of our measurement system works is we only measure a program episode if it's specifically requested by one of our clients; that's the way this works.","And so, 9,500 different program episodes, the client has asked us to measure each of those. And so it shows really the very strong interest in and demand for this particular measurement component of our overall Total Audience Measurement system.","Then to your second question regarding syndication in August of the Total Content ratings portion of our Total Audience Measurement framework, really nothing else has to happen other than the passage of time on that. We're on track. the product capability is sound. It's proven. Clients need a little bit more time to continue to sort Through the data to make sure they're comfortable with it, that they understand what it means for their business. And so, that's the key issue right now is allowing sufficient time for the marketplace to see the data and understand, and project what the likely impact is on their business and start to orient themselves around it.","So, yeah, we'll hit that mark in August for the Total Content ratings and we'll continue on to the next step from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur from Huber Research. Your line is open.","Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC","Yeah, just a balance sheet question for Jamere. Your gross debt keeps kind of inching up; it's over $8 billion now. What's sort of the upper end of your comfort level there on sort of the EBITDA, et cetera? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, what we said is that we're going to hold our leverage target somewhere in the three times area. So, translate that as probably not with a two handle or a four handle long-term. This gives us a lot of flexibility to number one, grow our business but also return meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","So, we are going to maintain a leverage target somewhere in that \u2013 that three times area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. A question back on Watch. This year media measurement has been further complicated by so many of the TV networks, the Turner and NBC and Viacom creating their own metrics like Turner Now and Viacom Vantage. I guess, my question is how many or are any of these metrics sourced by the data from marketing effectiveness? And then secondly, does the acquisition of Pointlogic play a role here? Thanks.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks Tom. So, what we saw on the upfronts this year with some of those types of things that you referenced is pretty typical of what we see in the upfronts pretty much every year, where each of the individual media companies on the sell-side of this equation look to differentiate themselves, and they look to differentiate themselves sometimes with their own proprietary metrics. And by the way, my opinion, that's smart. That's what I would do if I were them.","If you're on the other side of this equation though, if you are an agency or an advertiser, you're a buyer, you're looking to be able to compare across all the different places where you could invest your money. And so, these proprietary metrics aren't so useful sometimes if you're on the buying side of this because yeah, you don't know how to compare them to what the other media company or the other digital platform's offering. That's where Nielsen comes in.","We offer that ability to compare across all the different options with these comparable metrics across all the different media companies and also across all the streams and platforms where consumers go to consume this content. Now, having said that yeah, some of these proprietary metrics that some of those companies that you mentioned are touting in the marketplace, they are in fact powered by some of the capabilities from our portfolio, and especially our marketing effectiveness portion of our marketing effectiveness portfolio.","The analytics capabilities that are there, our ability to combine our understanding of what consumers watch and how it connects to what consumers buy often drives some of these, what are often referred to as secondary guarantees in the marketplace. They're not guarantees that replace the primary guarantee which is based on the currency metric that Nielsen provides. But they're a secondary guarantee that's added to that as people seek to target specific groups of consumers, maybe based on behavioral characteristics or purchasing behavior.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","And it's been good for our business, Nielsen Buyer Insights and Nielsen Catalina Solutions which are two offerings that we offer in that space that help our clients as they are pulling together these analytics metrics if you will have been growing double-digits and have been a part of the reason why our marketing effect in this business is so strong.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Tom, I forgot to mention that you asked about Pointlogic, does that play a role here. It definitely does. Pointlogic is a very important component in certain parts of that process that I described in my opening comments around plan, then activate and then assess the return on that investment. And Pointlogic in particular plays an important role on the front end of that process, the planning, but also in a couple of other places as that process unfolds. And it's one of the key reasons why we're really happy with that acquisition which continues to perform well for us.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Watts from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Aaron L. Watts - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey everyone, thanks for getting me in. Jamere, you've always been proactive in addressing your capital structure, you have a slice of term loan debt coming due in less than a year. Could you give us your latest thoughts there, whether you might use cash to pay that down or take advantage of current market conditions? And, maybe tied to that, your view on your balance of fixed versus floating rate debt in the current interest rate environment? Thanks.","Jamere Jackson - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we have a lot of optionality in the current market. If you look at sort of where high yields are trading, if you look at where interest rates are, there have been some pretty good windows here to go do something. You'll see us start to look at the 2017 stack and potentially look at some of the stack out as far as 2019, later in the year and probably in the early part of next year.","But the good news is that given the strength of our balance sheet, the strength of Nielsen as a credit, we have a lot of optionality and we will take advantage of the market opportunities and address the debt stack accordingly.","Operator","And, there are no further questions at this time.","Amy Glynn - Vice President, Investor Relations, Nielsen Holdings Plc","Great. Thank you for all of your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you after the call.","Dwight Mitchell Barns - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And, this concludes today's conference call.
