I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Audra, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Rob Crisci, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. Our press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our Web site at www.roperind.com.","Please turn to Slide 2; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the SEC. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information.","Now if you please turn to Slide 3, today we\u2019ll be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation which is available on our Web site.","For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of two discrete items. First, a purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and SHP, which we completed in the third quarter that totals about $1.4 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that absent our acquisition those businesses would have recognized. In addition, we had an inventory step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000.","And now if you please turn to Slide 3, -- sorry Slide 4, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we'll take questions from our participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We will try to get this call finished before snowstorm. So, if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We had all-time records for incoming orders, revenue that we build, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow. Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7%. We had pretty much broad based growth every place or operating margins in the quarter reached 30.1%, which was up 110 basis points, and the operating leverage was pretty spectacular in the quarter at 47%. We will comment about leverage going forward with our guidance.","Net earnings were up 13% to $187 million, or a $1.85 and operating cash flow was up sharply, a billion dollar run rate there to $261 million in the quarter, up 11% with free cash flow in that same kind of category. It\u2019s very little CapEx this year, about 1% of revenue, so very strong fourth quarter.","Next slide. We look at the income statement here, you can see the orders were up to $924 million versus $900 million a year-ago, up 3%; book-to-bill was 0.98x, but so we said before sort of 0.97x to 1.03x is the normal spread. But in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was always very low -- relatively low because we\u2019ve so much more year-end invoicing. So really that book-to-bill of 0.98x is not a problem, and we finished the year at 1.0x.","Revenue was up 7%. We had about 2 points of negative foreign exchange headwinds here in the fourth quarter. Gross profits stayed at remarkably high-level, here about 60%. The operating margin as we said before had 47% leverage, and that was just strong across the board as you will see. The tax rate was 60 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, which gave us about a penny and a half, so you can see the DEPS number at $1.85 versus last year\u2019s $1.65.","Next slide. Cash flow performance in the quarter was spectacular. We had 140% operating cash flow conversion and a 136% free cash flow conversion. Our cash flow has been growing as you can see if you look at 2012 and then \u201913 and \u201914. That\u2019s an 11% CAGR on operating cash flow in the last two years, and our free cash flow was 23% of revenue, which was about same as last year\u2019s 23% of revenue, pretty spectacular number. We still think cash is the best major performance, and if you follow our free cash flow and you follow the continued growth, then I think you\u2019d get a much better understanding about the quality of the Company\u2019s businesses.","Here we start the full-year enterprise results, next slide. If you look at the full-year income statement, orders were above $3.5 billion. They were up 5%, and the book-to-bill was exactly 1.0x. Revenue was up 9% with organic up 6% for the year, which was certainly in the wheelhouse of what we established this guidance at the beginning of the year. Gross margin for the full-year was up 70 basis points to 59.3%, and our operating margin was up 120 basis points, and for the full-year, we had operating leverage of 42%. We used to talk about -- well, I can go back to 25% to 30%, and then it was 30% to 35%. Recently, it\u2019s been 35% to 40%, and we\u2019re going to suggest that forward guidance for us is going to have operating leverage at 40% or above on the next dollar revenue.","Operating income was up 13%. Earnings before tax were up 16%. Tax was a headwind for us this year as we suggested it would be at the beginning of the year. It was 29.9% versus 29% last year. That caused an $0.08 headwind in our earnings, but even with that $0.08, we still produced $6.42, up 14%, and the GAAP number of course was up 19% on earnings per share.","Next slide, in terms of EBITDA and margin, on the left hand side, you will see EBITDA has increased over the last two years by 30%, from $925 million in 2012 to $1.2 billion this year. That\u2019s a $276 million increase. On EBITDA margins, we continue to improve margins, I think rather spectacularly. In 2012, our EBITDA was 30.8%, and people were saying, oh boy, you\u2019re going to have to revert to the mean now. You will be back down with everybody else in the 20s. Well of course, quite to the contrary, that\u2019s just wrong. We were 32.8% last year, and 33.8% this year, and that\u2019s all about our governance system and the quality of our businesses, record EBITDA performance.","Next slide. Here again, you see a tribute to the governance model, what we have and the field execution. Our asset-like business model inventory now running 5.1%, receivables at 16.1%, and the way we look at the working capital number, you can see it\u2019s dropped from 7% two years ago when people thought that was an unbelievably good number to now 5% at the end of this year, so our guys continue to understand how to execute our asset-like business model.","Next slide. If we look at the strong financial position and the balance sheet of the Company, it\u2019s certainly a powerful balance sheet with a lot of powder that we\u2019ve intended to use. You can see that cash has gone up to $610 million, a lot of that\u2019s not in the U.S., but our cash and undrawn revolver gives us a $2.1 billion capacity. The trailing 12-months EBITDA now has gone up to $1.2 billion, so our gross debt number at $2.2 billion is 1.8x our EBITDA, and we\u2019re going to be quite comfortable if it\u2019s at least a turn higher.","We will discuss our activity that\u2019s going to be occurring in the first quarter and throughout the year later, but we still believe we\u2019re going to deploy about $8 billion over the next five years in transactions.","Next slide. We will get into the specific detail now on the segment. If we look first at the revenue growth by segment last year, you\u2019ll see in the left hand side, on our organic basis, energy was up 5%, industrial technology with half of which is Neptune was up 7%, our Radio Frequency was up 5%, and Medical was up 8%. If we look at the total revenue, growth by segments you\u2019ll see Medical was up 16% as the acquisitions added to the organic number.","Next slide. Here we look at the overall segment performance on a dollar value and EBITDA basis, so that you can get some better clarity on the fact that RF and medical represents about two thirds of our total EBITDA progression and its well over half of our revenue now. So the original sort of Energy business is the smallest segment we have at $692 million, still outstanding performance with $226 million of EBITDA in the large section. First time that we\u2019ve ever had $1 billion segment in Roper, so you now have Medical with 1,082 million in revenue pretty good solid standalone entity with $472 million in EBITDA.","Next slide. If you look at the oil and gas component of the Company, that the legacy of the Company was oil and gas, and up until through 2007, it was a pretty big portion of the overall Company. Today it\u2019s a very, very small portion. Our upstream represents 5%; our Medical, RF and Software Water markets were 86% of the Company. And the downstream, midstream which is actually going to have modest growth this year is about 9%.","Now with the slides showing you in addition to the breakout here, our upstream business is about 5% of revenue. Some of that\u2019s in the Energy sector, and some is in the Industrial Technology sector where Roper Pump resides. We have even though the market we think will be down 20%, perhaps even a little bit more, where we\u2019ve a benefit in that Roper Pump has these technologies that we launched and the new facility to get a broader categories of those into the marketplace quickly in Houston a year-ago. Well, those shipments didn\u2019t really start to occur until the second half of the year in any level. So we\u2019ve an easy comp with the first half of 2015 and those products in which we\u2019re gaining share, so that will mitigate what normally would have been a deeper decline in upstream.","In our Field Service and Retrofit activity in midstream is actually continuing to move up a little bit and then we have the refinery instrumentation businesses in the field service associated with that also which will have modest growth. One of the things we did in December is we had all of our oil and gas people in for a couple of day meeting where we did a focused review to recast what they had originally submitted for 2015 projections, we had them bridge the risk by customer and by category, by product line. We reviewed the contingency plans and the triggers that they had in place. These guys are world class and nimble execution as they need to do stuff. They\u2019ve made a few changes already and are monitoring activity routinely.","In fact, Friday we had a dust up on exactly where we were January to date. I have to say that, the momentum is actually as good as it was in the fourth quarter. We really aren\u2019t seeing anything related to product follow up at all. It\u2019s above our expectation through the first three weeks of January, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything, but there has not been any early indicator yet other than project delays and what you hear from other people who aren\u2019t really determining their CapEx plans for later, but most of our products are not going into CapEx driven activity.","The guidance that we\u2019ve established and we\u2019ll talk about reflects the up-to-date business expectations of all of our oil and gas people of January 23 and as I say the product activity hasn\u2019t slowed. The other thing I think is I\u2019ve read some of the commentary about the Company is people thinking that there are some way to ascertain something that happened in 2008 or 2009 for our Company, and I guess we just fail to do a good enough job to remind people who we\u2019re. If you look at 2008, we added CBORD in February and then later in the year we added Horizon and Getloaded and Techlog [ph], three software companies, and those weren\u2019t in full-year for \u201908.","And then if you look at our acquisition, since \u201908 where people are doing comparisons, we\u2019ve added United Toll, which is a software system that\u2019s driving so much of our growth in TransCore, the iTradeNetwork, Verathon, Northern Digital Medical, Ascention Medical, Managed Healthcare Associates, Sunquest, Strategic Healthcare Programs last year, Innovative Product Achievements last year, FoodLink and now Strata Decision Technology, all these are either medical or software companies that created over a $1 billion in revenue, that\u2019s in our numbers today that wasn\u2019t there in 2007. So to say there are some Quid Pro Quo [ph] on this just the life and the reality of who we\u2019re and what we\u2019ve become.","Next slide. Here we look at the Energy Systems and Controls sector. We can tell you that there is about $125 million of revenue upstream out of our total Energy Systems and Controls business. You can see in the fourth quarter their operating profit was up 11%. Their OP margin reached 36.1% of 280 basis points and EBITDA for Energy in the fourth quarter was 39%.","Organic revenue was up 4%. We had very significant strength really in these -- some of the businesses that people think are going backward, so which -- as far its now or not. So our diesel engine shut off safety systems was up in the high teens and so was vibration monitoring. Field service growth continued, but we did see project activity declining at CCC or postponement. So that\u2019s something that we will be watching carefully throughout 2015.","As we look at guidance establishing for next year, we look at upstream declining, which is about 20% of the revenue in the segment. And then we think the midstream and downstream, we will have very modest growth and that represents about 40% of the total segment. And then the non oil and gas businesses are another 40% of the Energy Systems Control -- and Controls segment. So when we net it all together with declines in the upstream, modest growth in the non oil and gas arena of the segment, we think we will come in flat to modest organic growth for the year.","Next slide. Here we look at Industrial Technology. In Industrial Technology we have about $75 million of upstream revenue in the entire segment, and oil and gas sort of split a little bit between the upstream, not much downstream in the segment, maybe another $25 million at the most.","Here you can see that organic growth was 13% in the fourth quarter broad-based throughout the different businesses in the segment. Our Ropers -- Roper Pump had all-time performance records. We continue to win new customers with the newer technology and the product investments that we made over the last two years have really driven substantial revenue growth, and certainly help us as we get the end market follow-up and net activity.","We had growth at Neptune driven by strength in the U.S market. We are starting to see that Toronto project wind down and we will talk about that here in the guidance. We have double-digit growth in Material Analysis and the OP margins in our industrial segment, in the fourth quarter, you can see we\u2019re 31.4%, up 190 basis points and EBITDA hit $74.3 million at 33.8% of the revenue.","So in guiding in 2015, we think Roper Pump share gains will support flat revenue for them in total despite equity steep decline in the market. Neptune we think will continue to grow in the U.S. The Toronto project completion is expected in the first half of next year. You can never put your finger exactly on that, but they\u2019ve been moving at a faster pace than they originally suggested.","We\u2019ve had continued -- we expect continued growth in Material Analysis, although you got some currency issues with Danish krone and then we\u2019ve got the modes organic growth we\u2019re saying in the segment in whole, only because the Toronto RF project completion should occur sometime in the year and that could really create about a $25 million to $30 million divot [ph] in the segment on revenue, which is the bad news. But the good news is we\u2019ve got another RF product that\u2019s going to offset all of that and then some that we will talk about as we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment next.","So next slide. So here we go into RF Technology. We will just talk about the good news here. We were awarded a substantial contract for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Traffic Management System. This will be using our TransSuite Software Transportation Management System. This is totally different than trolling now. This is the stoplight transactions in Midtown Manhattan. There's a lot of installation management in this project, which of course is lower margin work. It\u2019s a five-year contract to support it post close. We do expect it will completely offset the Toronto wind down Neptune, even though both our RF business is one happens to report in industrial now and one in RF.","So now we look at segment as a whole, you can see that revenue was up just slightly. Toll and Traffic Infiniti Lane Project Execution remain very strong with favorable variances, both in Texas and Florida. We had terrific subscriber growth in our Freight Matching businesses, DAT and get loaded. And iTrade strength in the U.S was pretty good, but unfortunately offset by the U.K. weakness and problems in the U.K. with that business.","Technolog declined, another U.K. based software business in the utility industry, but bid activity was pretty strong and Technolog tends to be a little bit up and down kind of business and should be up again in 2015. So then if we look at the -- in addition to that OP margin at 28.4%, EBITDA for the segment was $82.4 million at 34.3% and RF now represents 26% of the enterprises EBITDA.","In addition to the Saudi contract that was awarded, we do expect additional scope in the foreseeable future around this, because the Riyadh of course a very important city that only one in many. TransCore\u2019s backlog and quote activity is going to support segment growth for 2015. And the Toll Tag growth that we\u2019ve enjoyed recently is going to continue, particularly, in Florida and Texas where people continue to migrate to our very small stiffer tag as opposed to the plastic boxes that so many people in New England still use.","Software and SaaS businesses are going to continue to grow mid single-digits, very high margins. They draw up a lot of cash that allow us to make reinvestments in their own businesses or by bolt-on things for them. And the segment we think at the end of the year will have the single-digit organically.","So next let\u2019s look at Medical. I think this will be the last time in a call that we will be able to contain Medical on one slide. As you can see we worked very hard to try to achieve that and pretty much made it, but I don't think all that's going on there everything we know about will allow us to do that ever again. So prepare yourself for two slides in 2015.","So here we are with a very strong fourth quarter, up 12% revenue. OP was up 15%, operating margins 35.5% aren\u2019t the real story here. The real story here is EBITDA. We delivered $126.3 million in the fourth quarter in EBITDA, which was 43.9% EBITDA margin. Really the way you have to think about the segment now is that its medical products in one leg get software and service in another leg and then the residual life science imaging component that we have in there.","Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9%. We had double-digit growth at MHA with share gains and favorable end markets which continue. Sunquest growth continued; we had some customer implementation that customers delayed into 2015 that we thought was interesting, which is fine with us.","New products at Verathon really drove spectacular growth in the fourth quarter at Verathon and we like to think that\u2019s going to continue throughout 2015. Our imaging family improved somewhat with Gatan had a strong quarter, which really led that growth. And Gatan has shifted much more emphasis around life science. It used to be kind of split between physical science and life science, but with the new technologies we\u2019ve introduced in the exceptions of the K2 camera technology and filters, more and more life science is coming our way.","And the last bullet point here SHP, which is strategic healthcare programs, and IPA, Innovative Products performed really well. They\u2019re certainly on track with what we thought at the time we acquire them and probably have better forward growth than we might have guessed.","As we think about 2015, I think we have to start with the context of understanding that MHA and Sunquest are really truly transformational for Roper. They\u2019re more transformational today than Neptune and TransCore were in the early point of the audit. They\u2019ve really great focused opportunities to build on each one of those businesses, Sunquest and MHA, including acquisitions that the number of acquisitions we can make as much broader than anything we\u2019ve ever had. One disappointment around Neptune is it's done exceedingly well, but we haven't been able to acquire things, because its competitors are less than exciting and most of the people we see in this space were not the kind of companies we\u2019d want to own. Thank goodness Neptune has outperformed all those over these years.","TransCore we\u2019ve been able to build out somewhat through acquisition, but mostly it's been organic growth. But Sunquest and MHA are different story. MHA is capturing new opportunities, its benefiting from favorable demographics. Its acquisition and strategic healthcare programs was really the first addition that we\u2019ve the MHA in the third quarter of 2014. We expect another one is going to happen yet within this quarter.","Sunquest had this moderating growth for 2015 because of the meaningful use upgrades that have been driving such high-level growth in the recent past, but our investments in eternal development of things we\u2019re doing with partners that we aren\u2019t really able to talk about yet and the opportunities that they\u2019ve in front of them are really exciting. We are likely to announce another important acquisition here soon that relates to Sunquest. So both MHA and Sunquest I think you will see continued acquisitions building those very large platforms down the road.","The Medical device businesses are on a pretty solid growth path for 2015. We think that Verathon\u2019s going to continue to have its market share gains and product replacements going on. And then we just last week announced our first deal of the year won\u2019t be the last. And that's Strategic Decision Technology which is a company run by Dan Michelson in Chicago. It\u2019s a very exciting company with a new product. It\u2019s a small company of kind of low -- just turn past $30 million of revenue, but they\u2019ve been growing at 20% in the last three years and now with an infusion of capital from us, they\u2019re going to able to continue to raise that growth spectrum. They have a new phenomenal product, which is so important for the country around by cost containment, cost improvement for hospitals. Their StrataJazz platform has been running at number of hospitals in a variety of ways, but the new programs that Dan and his team are going to be offering that came out of a project that they did for Northwestern Hospital -- University is really spectacular.","In total, then for the segment we think we will have mid to high single-digit organic growth for the segment by the end of the year and I commit to you that we won\u2019t crowd the slide. We will just do two in the future.","Okay, now 2015 guidance. Here if we turn to page, so a full-year guidance we established at $6.70 to $6.94 and -- but we put a good deal of energy into looking at this. The organic revenue growth for next year we think will be around 3% to 5% and that\u2019s after completing adjusting for the newer macroeconomic trends that people have seen since December 30th to now. Operating profit leverage we can probably say will be above 40%, and that's pretty good by anybody standards.","Our foreign exchange rates going to hurt us. All of our guidance is still predicated on the year-end numbers. We think that's going to cost us about $0.10, which is inside these numbers. If the dollar continues to strengthen even more, you\u2019d have a little bit more risk. It could be as high as twice that number if today\u2019s rates lasted for the entire year, it got worse.","The tax rate we think will come in around 30% to 31%. That\u2019s about a nickel headwind into the comparative earnings at the midpoint. So it could be a little higher if the tax rate got higher last year. If you remember, it was 29.9%, so we\u2019re hoping it will be around 30%, but it could certainly go up to 31%. The guidance of $6.70 to $6.94 gives you a mid point of $6.82 is excluded in the future acquisitions that will occur or any divestitures. And the full operating cash flow we\u2019re establishing at the beginning of the year would exceed $900 million of operating cash flow for 2015 with our normally strong cash conversion.","First quarter we established DEPS at a $1.47 to $1.53. It includes Strata, but it excludes any other acquisitions that will happen in the first quarter or any divestitures that could occur.","Next slide. So here we look at the 2014 summary and 2015 prospects. So Q4 we had record performance, very strong finish to a terrific year. For the full-year, we achieved record results in all these categories, orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Revenue was up 9% with organic up 6%. Very significant financial achievements, sort of threshold level activity where you see operating profit exceeded $1 billion in the Company for the first time, margin at 28.2%, 42% operating profit leverage. The EBITDA exceeded $1.2 billion for the first time and EBITDA margin got all the way up to 33.8%.","Free cash flow was 23% of revenue and we expanded our Medical and Software platforms with three acquisitions of Strategic Healthcare, Innovative Products and FoodLink. And these three deals which were smaller than the things we\u2019ve done recently are really a precursor or some of the types of outstanding businesses you\u2019re going to see us continuing to add in Medical and Software where they\u2019ve higher growth characteristics that tend to be somewhat smaller revenue businesses, and there are a lot of these that we\u2019re involved with as we speak.","In 2015, we expect to have record performance of Roper despite the fears around macroeconomics. We are going to deploy over $1 billion. We are very confident of and the year could easily be more than that. The first deal Strata we talk about a little bit, but it\u2019s not going to be the only deal in the first quarter, that\u2019s likely. I think it\u2019s important as we close out the call and get ready for the Q&A here that, we are really well positioned in 2015, because the company really, the emergence as a technology platforms and our ability to deploy capital are slightly more important than many of the macroeconomic considerations in markets that so many people talk about. So, we\u2019re looking forward to a great year in 2015, and with that we would like to open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Hi. Good morning everyone.","Brian Jellison","Hi. Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie","So, I guess, I\u2019ll be bracing myself for the -- the second slide on Medical and Scientific Imaging coming next quarter. But the, the first question I have for you guys \u2026","Brian Jellison","That won't be very important in that second slide that term, Scientific Imaging. Think about medical and software, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie","Fair enough. So, I thought, look, good quarter, good year. Brian, I know that your company has undergone a significant transformation since the 2008, 2009 timeframe where we had energy prices implode. But a lot of the acquisitions, that have occurred -- has occurred outside of energy, and the question I have is really on the energy portfolio. And how has that evolved really since 2008, 2009 where you just see some pretty significant organic growth declines during that timeframe. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how the portfolio there has evolved? How you expect to have a more resilient earning stream in energy during this downturn that we\u2019ve seen?","Brian Jellison","Well, certainly, a big part of what happens in energy is our [Verathon] technology, which has been very important for the continuous operation of what's going on with fracking. It doesn\u2019t require new wells. It doesn\u2019t require rig count or anything else, and we didn\u2019t have that technology in 2008, that\u2019s only just appeared really in 2013 and \u201914. So, that\u2019s like an additional business that wasn\u2019t there previously. We also acquired a software control company called the United Controls for CCC that offers various things that we didn\u2019t have out of CCC in terms of dealing with different types of gas turbine engine technologies on a retrofit basis and that\u2019s useful. We had online software that we added to our PAC business, Cambridge Viscosity and Trinity Software for CCC. So, we\u2019ve got some things that continue to grow and aren\u2019t related to rate counts and upstream activity. So that\u2019s good. I would say though, there are businesses that are in oil & gas are spectacularly great businesses. They have EBITDA margins that are consistent with the overall enterprise EBITDA margins; and it\u2019s pretty much or best in class activity. Thank goodness, the vast majority of their activity is not upstream. Well over 60% of those businesses are downstream and midstream, and so that helps a lot.","John Humphrey","The other thing I would say, Joe is that, also who wants to learn from the successes that we had and what did occur in these businesses during 2009. Well 2009 was really a demand shock. It wasn\u2019t that price went down, and therefore everything else went down. The price went down because everything else went down. All right, so let\u2019s understand that we don\u2019t see an enormous decline, so therefore the large installed base that we have around compressor controls and instrumentation for PAC, which really serves the midstream and downstream markets, those will continue because those are more throughput driven, and we don\u2019t see the 15% kind of immediate demand of shock across not only that segment, but the entire world that we saw in 2009. So, we want to make sure that we are very nimble in the way that we act, and particularly on the upstream side where it\u2019s always a little more cyclical than the rest of the oil stream market.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay, that\u2019s -- now that\u2019s helpful color guys. And I guess, just maybe one follow-up here. You talked about, historically your incremental margins being in that 35% to 40% range, but here you continue to do 40 plus. As you head into 2015, your growth rate is going to slightly slower than \u201914, at least that\u2019s what you\u2019re projecting today. And you had some headwinds in that RFX business in 2014, and so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for your confidence in that 40 plus percent incremental, and how are you guys thinking about that across the different parts of your portfolio?","John Humphrey","So, I mean a little north of that number in medical, given the underlying margin structure, and the amount of software that we have not only there but also in RF. When we look at Industrial and Energy, that\u2019s where we\u2019re probably a little more comfortable in the 35% to 45% range, right a little bit wider variation there, because not as much of it is the consistently high margin that we see across the other two. But in terms of confidence going into 2015, we have a lot of confidence around that. I would demonstrate in our ability to have that type of leverage not only around 2014, but also in previous years, and with the contingent mix towards more technology, I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation for you.","Brian Jellison","Yes, I think you\u2019ve got to remember in 2015 that most of the incremental revenue, which will result in the operating profit leverage is going to come from RF and from medical. We\u2019re not going to have a lot of incremental revenue in energy and industrial in 2015. So, I wouldn\u2019t worry so much about the -- what that ratio is, because its -- it maybe a very high number on a very small base.","Joseph Ritchie","Yes, that\u2019s a fair point. I\u2019ll get back in queue guys. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Brian Jellison","Hi. Good morning, Shannon.","John Humphrey","Good morning, Shannon.","Brian Jellison","Welcome back.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Yes, thanks. Good to be back. Hey, maybe to start with medical. Brian, you sound very optimistic there. Just curious, how much of that is related to just where Roper has evolved to in the M&A opportunities you\u2019re seeing versus how much you actually see the overall medical market getting better out there?","Brian Jellison","Well, we got a lot of different businesses here, right. So, if we look at our medical products businesses, those things are getting driven not so much by demography, but by product technology that we continue to introduce and they are high margin businesses. We do a lot of reinvestment in them, and they really have market leading technology. So, they are not really driven by some aggregate number about demography or a medical market. Then if you get to our Sunquest and MHA, our businesses which are software and software like, they are -- they have a lot of demography benefits. I mean, there\u2019s going to be more testing, not less testing. There is going to be more needs for post acute care. There\u2019s going to be more activity around Hospice and nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities, and all those things that MHA does so well. We\u2019re certainly going to bowl on some acquisition this year for MHA, and you\u2019ll see we\u2019ll just reinforce all those things in a big way. So, they are creating markets more so than anything else. I mean, these guys really are the leaders in that market place. People do read across on us with somebody, well they read across for Sunquest, if you look at Cerner. So look, they\u2019re doing well, we\u2019re doing well, epic is doing well, the space is doing well. If you look then at the life science business, that business, it can has sort of preemptive technology related to filtering and camera technology for life science, things that you\u2019re looking at, molecular biology. So, it\u2019s a great space. It\u2019s going to do well. The other ones which are very small really are less medical. They\u2019re really more about nanotechnology and development in the physical sciences. So, that has less derived demand than the others do.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Now that helps a lot here, thanks. And then, I\u2019m just -- obviously a lot more volatile world here so far in 2015. How do you think that\u2019s impacting the M&A world? You obviously sound very optimistic that\u2019s related or unrelated to the volatility. But is this all a good or a bad thing in terms of what you think you can get done out there?","Brian Jellison","Well, the M&A world hasn\u2019t changed very much. When you think about the world in which we participate which is really primarily acquiring companies from private equity. So, we\u2019re not out shopping around for public companies if you see a distorted value or something. We tend to think public company\u2019s acquisitions are problematic for the most part. I mean, it could happen, but it\u2019s not where we\u2019re looking. So, the only good new development in the M&A front is that, there\u2019s a lot more pressure on the banks to limit their debt to EBITDA staples to six times or five times. And most of the last several years, debt staples have been seven or seven and a half, mezzanine coming on top of it. So private equity could put in three year four turns of other peoples money and use debt at extremely high leverage ratios, and be very definitive in the acquisition market. So, pretty much our competitors for -- when we think about who our competitors are and this is a capital deployment company at its core. We look at all the large private equity guys. We love them, because they own a lot of stuff we want to acquire. But we\u2019re not willing to go up to four or five or six time\u2019s debt to EBITDA, and they start at six or seven time\u2019s debt to EBITDA. So it\u2019s still a tough market for us.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Deane Dray","We appreciate the additional color on the -- and disclosures on the oil & gas business because obviously there\u2019s still a lot of scrutiny there. And then recognizing this is 5% of your business on the upstream side, can you provide some more color on the assumption on the 20% market down? Because if you look at the CapEx sensitivity where oil is, you could push that to 35% down, 40% down, but a lot of that hinges on CapEx and the fall off in customer CapEx, and you said several times that you\u2019re not so leveraged to customer CapEx. So maybe expand on that, how much is aftermarket? The retrofit and field service part of your business, and so, how do you, I\u2019m sure that leads you to that down 20% as your assumption. So, maybe just walk through how you\u2019re seeing that play out?","Brian Jellison","John and I are looking at each other fighting to see who wants to answer this very fair question. I mean, unfortunately there\u2019s never any one answer, because we have a role up here with the revenue we\u2019ve shared with you and 5% is upstream, and 9% is midstream and downstream. But while the RF products and the markets we serve are so niche that they don\u2019t lend themselves to the same macroeconomic situation that you see with other people where you could look at rig counts. For instance, what we haven\u2019t talked about is, how much of our business is upstream oil, and how much is upstream gas? How much is in the United States? How much is outside United States? And we\u2019ve -- for competitive reasons don\u2019t want to get more granular than we have, right? So, we just feel that the retrofit activity that CCC does and it already has booked and continues to do will have growth. The upstream portion that they have are related to any new LNG projects is going to be down, and it could be down substantially beyond 20%. But it wouldn\u2019t defect us until the second half of the year, because the kind of things that we do on a project basis are still rolling along when one of our high growth small businesses is diesel engine shut-off valves which somebody had downstream, but its really an upstream business. That business last year was up 16%. So, we can imagine that it could be up, so we think it\u2019s going to be down, the reversal will be more. So, but the only fair way to answer the question is; what if CapEx and others didn\u2019t sell off and you had a fee of 35%, our view would be -- it would be 35% in the second half of the year, but maybe 15% in the first half of the year. So, I think those people who are writing about fears in 2016 that we\u2019re reading everything everybody is writing. But we got no data to support any downturn yet except us being conservative and taking a 20% whack off of everything that goes into those markets. John, do you want to add to that?","John Humphrey","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t add. Mostly I think that Brian described what our views are with respect to the guidance and to the expectations for the end market. What I would -- that I would say is that, our businesses -- one of the great things about our business structure is we have people who are very close to their customers. We have six different businesses that have some exposure to oil & gas. And so, whether it\u2019s Russ or its Kevin or Joe, any of the guys that we know individually they are very close to their customers and can react very quickly to changes in demand. They are not waiting for us and our assumptions about what's going to happen in the macro world to set their plans. These are very quick businesses to act. The asset light nature of our business means that they don\u2019t have a lot of fixed cost that require a long lead time in order to make adjustments to their cost structure. So, I have every confidence that these guys are very close to what's happening. We\u2019ll be able to act quickly whether that means that the market is going to be worse than we currently expect, or it\u2019s going to be better than we currently expect. They are not looking to us for those answers. They get to be very close with our customers and know exactly what's going on, on a real time basis.","Brian Jellison","I think we need to also add, because we probably don\u2019t explain this well enough is that our businesses in those spaces are not the least bit capital intensive, and these are factory driven businesses. These businesses can flex immediately and they have all kinds of flexing ability with manpower. So, most of the other companies in these segments, they\u2019ve got big factory operations. So, what happens in a downturn for them is absorption wipes them off the base of the year. We just don\u2019t have anything like that. We just don\u2019t. If you look at the physical asset investment that we have, and add back accumulated appreciation to that number, our gross investment is very, very small even in the oil & gas arena. These are mostly test and assembly businesses. There are only a few things we do that involve machining operation. So, a downturn to us is a lot different than a downturn to GE\u2019s oil & gas business.","Deane Dray","Look, that\u2019s exactly the additional color that we were looking for on why you can set a number at 20% for that upstream piece. So, that\u2019s exactly what we were digging at. And just as a follow-up a couple here. Maybe you can flush out the expectations on the share gain for Roper Pump, just anything quantitative what happened in 2014 regarding market share, what the opportunity is? And then for John, with the FX pressures, we\u2019re seeing a number of companies engaging for the first time some additional currency hedging and would that be appropriate for you guys?","Brian Jellison","Hedging?","John Humphrey","So, I\u2019ll take the second one first. No, we don\u2019t do hedging. Our FX risk is not transactional. We have a very good balance between where we generate revenue and where our cost structure lies. So, we\u2019re not really subject to that risk. The impact that we have is the translation effect of earnings as they\u2019re generated, whether they\u2019re being Canadian dollars or they\u2019re in euros or pounds. And with respect to hedging, I mean you can change the timing, but you can't change the magnitude. Eventually unless someone has figured out a way to hedge for the next 20 years, they know what the currencies are doing do and you can hedge for a little while. But those are folks that are really more plan driven, and have much longer cycles than I think our company does. So, as we look at the sensitivity, I think Brian has already mentioned the fact that we are expecting little bit less than 2% headwind from an FX standpoint for 2015 that translates to about a dime. So, we\u2019ll have to see what the future holds.","Deane Dray","And on the market share expectations?","John Humphrey","So Roper Pump was up about 20% in 2014 with -- frankly they were up almost double that in the second half of 2014 as production ramped up for the facility not really facility driven but the fact that where the share gains required us to go ahead and expand some capabilities there. And so, it really doubled their growth rates towards the back half of the year. And as Brian said, it gives us a little bit of a easier comp in the first half of the year, because we do expect to maintain those share gains with the expansion of some of our Verathon product lines.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gents.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple of things. Brian, you mentioned divestitures twice in your pitch. I was wondering, if you could just -- obviously you\u2019re not going to identify businesses, but it sounds like you are more actively looking at that. Perhaps just a little bit more color on your thought process there.","Brian Jellison","Well, I don\u2019t know about us looking at it more actively, but yet we certainly have had more inbound requests and we don\u2019t even follow-up, I mean, its very rare there is anything we own that we\u2019re interested in getting rid of, but somebody might talk us out of something. So, I think it\u2019s possible that you could see a divestiture within 2015, but it wouldn\u2019t be a very meaningful -- it would be a non-strategic asset if we did sell something.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. Could you roughly size now maybe just as a percent of the segment, the three buckets in medical now?","Brian Jellison","Three medical products, and then software [indiscernible].","Jeffrey Sprague","Software and life sciences. Yes.","John Humphrey","Sure. So, medical represents about 80% of the segment, and then its split very evenly between the medical service and technology, the medical products. Now, I\u2019m talking from a revenue perspective now. So, 80% net, so call it 40% medical technology and service, 40% medical products, and 20% imaging. Now from a contribution to earnings the medical technology comes in higher from an EBITDA perspective, so it\u2019s either more strong on the medical technology front.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. And Brian, this question also kind of comes up strategically, but it kind of tweaked me to ask it. You mentioned, Cerner as a comp TradeNet some 40 times earnings or so. We do have a -- you have a very interesting unique portfolio here that\u2019s really not an industrial company anymore. What's your thought process around the company in its current configuration?","Brian Jellison","So we like the configuration. We got a great industrial and energy business that throws off a massive amount of cash that provides a wonderful annuity for us to go out and maintain an investment grade status and acquire a lot of great software and medical businesses and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for a long time. When there\u2019s a confluence of reports that you see out there, I think they fundamentally keep talking about or how are you trading as a premium to the multi industry group. It seems so high when in reality it\u2019s beautifully low against who we actually compete against for market capital. So, at some point in time if that doesn\u2019t get recognized better than it does from time-to-time, there\u2019s always flexibility in what we would do. But we\u2019re going to keep building out our situation. Now we started from next to nothing to create a billion dollar medical and software company. Our RF business is largely a software company, and industrial with Neptune, Neptune is not really industrial, it\u2019s really radio frequency. It just reports over there. So, I think you\u2019re likely to see more internal strategic developments around these various businesses than you are seeing something that would result in selling off a big component of it or anything like that.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just one other really quick one, you\u2019re at 1.8 churns and you said you\u2019ll be comfortable to add a churn, folks call it basically 3-ish. Are you comfortable to just operate perpetually at 3 or is that kind of you flex to 3 and then you work it back down to 2 sort of thing.","Brian Jellison","Well, I think it will just depend on the quality of everything that we see. Its not -- when we model ourselves, we model very modest organic growth and kind of 2.5 times debt to EBITDA. I think when we\u2019re below 2.5 times, we feel sort of underinvested and if we got up to 3.25, we wouldn\u2019t be the least to concern with the quality of our cash. I mean, last year for instance we closed out year-over-year that balance sheet up $400 million in cash and we paid for $300 million of acquisitions. And if you look at $2.2 billion of powder you got to figure another, what do we say $900 million operating cash flow this year. So, be it $3 billion, it would be nice to get $1.5 billion to work over the next 12 to 15 months to keep our ratios where we are. So, at the moment we\u2019re underinvested, but that\u2019s because of our discipline, not because of the opportunity. And like I said, Strata is not going to be our only acquisition this quarter.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thank you very much.","John Humphrey","Audra, even though we\u2019re at 9:30, I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions.","Operator","Okay. We will go next to Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Good morning.","Brian Jellison","Good morning, Glynn.","Christopher Glynn","Couple of questions within RF on TransCore and iTrade. TransCore, I think historically the international deals have been sort of one off and it sounds like now you\u2019re alluding Brian to maybe more sustained skill opportunity, so curious about that. And then with iTradeNetwork just if we could elaborate on what's sort of off the tracks in the UK and how FoodLink is opening up the addressable markets there for ITN?","Brian Jellison","Well the international business TransCore is sizable and very important. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things we do, but they have been -- it\u2019s not broad based. They are specific situations we\u2019re developing a relationship with the government or developing a relationship with a particular agency, so that\u2019s the case in Dubai. Well, people travel in and out of Dubai marvel at simplicity all of the way that traffic moves and how easy it is to buy a tag. It\u2019s certainly not lost on any of the other Arab countries. All of them would like to be deploying these technologies. So, the Saudi\u2019s now have this breakthrough project in Riyadh. We assume it will be widely successful, and that will encourage them to put in change orders to expand it there and hopefully over the next 10 years we\u2019ll have a much, much larger degree of penetration around the Arab peninsula. We are very well positioned in that area to continue to grow, and if you hadn\u2019t had the year of spring you would have seen a lot more activity than it has been able to occur. In Europe they are pretty well served today, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to expand much in Europe, and in Asia generally we have a lot of issues when to get around the quotation. We have few, a lot -- very specific boundaries. One is, no Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that some of the people who\u2019re competing in this space don\u2019t seem to be bothered by that. But we\u2019re very, very conservative in that area. So, this Saudi project is a big deal. It\u2019s going to be pushing $100 million over the next several years, and we expect it to be $25 million or $30 million this year to offset the Toronto wind down. On the subject to iTrade; iTrade is really doing much better now in the U.S. and FoodLink is substantially ahead of the early commitments, after just a few months I think we\u2019ve made a number of improvements to their processes, and they\u2019ve got good leadership from their own people and our people that are supporting them. In the UK the pub businesses have been off quite a bit and the U.K\u2019s had considerable difficulty with -- it\u2019s really not iTrade, it\u2019s an acquisition that the KKR people have done just before we bought it, but we would have never done. And it\u2019s always been problematic, and it\u2019s really more about data analytics that really ought be owned by somebody that\u2019s in the package good analytics arena, but we\u2019re going to try to clean it up and make it a little bit better. The end markets haven\u2019t been very favorable.","Christopher Glynn","Great. Thanks for the story.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Hi, good morning Brian, John, Rob.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Richard Eastman","Brian, could you just talk for a second about Strata. Maybe give some, could you just talk about how much you maybe paid for the business? And then also, is there a tie-in with SHP here in terms of taking their accounting software from the non-profit environment to the clinical market? And then maybe just lastly on that acquisition; it seems there is a number of these smaller healthcare software businesses owned by private equity and perhaps private equity hasn\u2019t been able to build the scale with these businesses that they might -- you might otherwise think they could? And I\u2019m curious under your ownership, I mean, do you -- are you more confident that you can cobble these businesses together and create some scale here?","Brian Jellison","Well, we\u2019re going to do a great job with the businesses, but it won't be by cobbling them together. We\u2019re un-cobblers here. Consolidation rarely sustains growth companies. These businesses, when private equity owns them, they always own them with an eye to exit. So, their first year, 18 months of ownership, they\u2019re happy to make investments, but they got to stop on a dime. And they have to capitalize the leverage they get out of those investments, because they got to get rid of it in four or five year. So it almost invariable and we acquire them, we\u2019re acquiring something that has been under invested in for growth for 18 month or two-year period and the people can\u2019t focus as much on their end markets, saying growth as they can when they come here, because now they can stop worrying about managing for a sale and start worrying about serving their customers and thinking clearly about where to put their resources. That\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re the successful acquirer of so many of these kinds of businesses. I\u2019m sure that Barbara at Strategic Healthcare could have probably -- frankly gotten a larger number from somebody else that would have wiped out everything she built in Santa Barbara and absorbed it, because they would have wanted to cobble it together with something and the same thing would be true in Dan\u2019s business in Chicago with Strata. So Strata is going to be a platform for us even though it\u2019s relatively small now. It's not something that gets cobble together with Sunquest or with MHA. Now we are going to make other acquisitions, some very quickly that will be very complimentary to an MHA and very complementary to Sunquest. So there is a lot of opportunity that we didn\u2019t have to find those kinds of things. We are always looking for great teams, great ability to grow, buying a business that\u2019s got a little over $30 million in revenue, and to grow 20% is more interesting than buying a business at $50 million of revenue that can\u2019t grow at all. So we are excited about that. If you noted in Strata, that\u2019s an LLC. So the big -- one of the big things about economics here is we get a really big tax benefit. In fact, our gross tax benefit on Strata is going to be of $40 million. So that\u2019s a major part of the consideration in the purchase price of the business and Strata is a business that\u2019s going to have over $30 million of revenue and its going to have the EBITDA in our typical Roper kind of strategies and the purchase price is $140 million, but that included the $40 million plus of tax benefits.","Richard Eastman","Well, when I talk about -- again, when I look at their customer base in Strata, it would just seem that you could share and leverage kind of the customer basis that\u2019s some of these other businesses say SHP, because I look at -- again, I look at Strata having been around for since \u201996 and the $30 million revenue number at them. So the dynamics and the economics of that business, for their customers has improved apparently over the last five years and the demand factor there?","Brian Jellison","Yes, I think that\u2019s true and also just the expansion that Dan and his team been able to do in terms of the product lines and the other things that helped people on the cost side. Well, what I would say is that -- look we do see opportunities for these businesses to be able to learn from each other. I know that both Strata and SHP are very excited about the product lines that each of them have and the opportunities there to be able to learn from each other. It\u2019s always balance for us. We think there is incredible value in having a business focused on its niche and on its existing customers, particularly one with that has so much runway and ability to capture opportunities like Strata. But we do see the ability to have Strata work with maybe another market opportunity that MHA may have. So we see those as future opportunities, but we never want to have someone take their eye off the ball of the current niche focus that they have. So we\u2019re not going to try to combine anything together. We always think if we have smart people in the room together that will be able to learn something.","Richard Eastman","I got it. Okay, well thank you. Thanks for getting the question in.","Brian Jellison","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks. ","John Humphrey","Okay. Thank you, Audra. Once again, everyone thanks for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you again in three months as we finish up our first quarter.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

LLC","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Operator","The Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zack Moxcey, the Vice President of Investor Relations.","Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Britney, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Chief Operating Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President-Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now, if you'll please turn to slide 2; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to slide 3; today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; a deferred tax expense resulting from the held for sale classification of Gatan; and lastly, a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amount resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","And now if you'll please turn to slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. So, slide 4 gives you the overview of what we'll go through today. The second quarter 2018 enterprise results; a detailed look at the segment and the outlook for each segment; the quarter three and full-year guidance; and then we'll open it up for questions.","So next slide, slide 5, the Q2 enterprise highlights. We had, as you know by now, record second quarter results, all time for revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, and a host of other things. Revenue was up 13% to $1.3 billion and organic revenue was up 9%. The additional good news it was very broad-based across all four segments, really. Gross margin was up 40 basis points to 63.1%, so that demonstrates again we're not seeing very much pressure on either price or cost issues that you're hearing about from many other multi-industry people.","EBITDA is up 14% to $449 million and EBITDA margin is 34.6%. The DEPS numbers is up 29% to $2.89. Operating cash flow was up 55% in the quarter to $266 million. And importantly, we deployed $1.1 billion to acquire PowerPlan and entered into an agreement to divest Gatan for $925 million.","The timing at Gatan we had hoped would sort of demonstrate it really is a trade out of PowerPlan for Gatan. But the Gatan timing, it's got regulatory things that happened. So, it may not really close until the end of the year. Really, an outstanding quarter, very strong growth, margin expansion pretty much across the board, and record cash flow.","Next slide. We look at the income statement, you could see that revenue reached nearly $1.3 billion, gross profit was up by 40 basis points from 62.7% to 63.1%. EBITDA was up to 34.6%, so about 30 basis points of improvement there. Earnings before tax \u2013 which is a number we want to have in here because a lot of the earnings reports were really talking about this year versus last year without adjusting for the tax benefits \u2013 so earnings before tax is up 17% on a revenue improvement of 13%, and that excludes the benefit of the new tax treatment. If you get to the DEPS number, where you see the benefit of the tax treatment, then earnings are up 29%. Tax rate was 23.1% versus 31% the year before, so you can see that the Tax Act is certainly working for us.","Next slide. On compounding cash flow, you could see on that we delivered $266 million in the quarter up from $172 million last year. Our operating cash flow almost all turns into free cash flow, because we have so little CapEx. So you could see free cash flow here of $0.25 billion and our trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $1.230 billion which represented 25% of revenue. So, we're still on track for a very solid record cash performance in 2018.","Next slide. If you look at the asset-light business model that we put in place, you continue to see a really important facet which is that the negative net working capital number has now really become a sustainable thing. So that sustainability is quite substantial.","If you look at the chart here, you'll see deferred revenue has grown in just two years from $281 million in 2016 to $627 million at the end of this quarter. So that's a $346 million increase in deferred revenue in two years.","Inventory is down to 4.3% of sales, and I always like to look at it not only just over this last three-year period but what was it five years ago? Well, five years ago our inventory was 6.3% of revenue, and now it's 4.3%.","Receivables were 19.7% of revenue and now they're 16.4% of revenue. Payables and accruals were 11.3% of revenue and now they're 10.9%. Deferred revenue was 6.7% of revenue at the end of the second quarter in 2013, now it's 11.7% of revenue.","So when you add inventory and receivables, subtract payables and accruals and deferred revenue, we're negative at 1.9% of sales. Five years ago, it was 8%. So we've had a shift of 10 percentage points of total revenue in net working capital, which is why we were so committed to continuing the transformation of the company. And it's going to improve further actually when we get \u2013 complete the trade out of Gatan for PowerPlan.","So next slide. Here you've got the segment detail and outlook. Next slide. If we look at here the four segments, you could see the gross segment and EBITDA margin of each of the four segments, which all of them are really best-in-class numbers.","So I know people \u2013 there's a lot been said about price, cost, tariffs; none of those are going to have any effect on us. We've got very nimble execution in the field. We went through our quarterly report process with everybody, and the nimbleness of the execution they demonstrated in there around any supply chain issues was really spectacular.","We have such an incredible benefit because our cost of goods are so low compared to the typical multi-industry company. I mean, you see all these gross margins, but when you add it all up, our cost of goods sold represents about 36.9% of revenue. So you just don't have the same pressure that somebody who's got gross margins of 38% and cost of goods sold at 62% has.","Our Energy business is down to 13% of total revenue. Industrial Tech \u2013 which a lot of that is Neptune \u2013 is 18% of revenue. So the more cyclical items in here certainly have performed phenomenally in the second quarter, but we don't see a lot of risk around that turning around over the course of the year. And RF & Software is running 42% of revenue, with Medical at 29%, so it's still well over two-thirds of the company's businesses.","Next slide, slide 11. So this is the first segment slide, starting with the largest at RF Technology in the quarter. They did $539 million in revenue, which was up 13% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 19% from the prior year. Operating margin was 29.6%, but in here you got a lot of noncash amortization that goes into the operating profit margin. So looking at the EBITDA margin you could see how fantastic the RF segment is. It's at 39.3% EBITDA margin.","If you look at the Q2 highlights for the businesses, organically we're up about 7%. Deltek had really a very, very good quarter, solid growth, very good execution in both their enterprise and small business platforms across both key areas of GovCon and Professional Services.","And you want to remember that the Professional Services market we talk about isn't us doing services, it's Professional Services software for other people who are doing professional services. We had large wins in the quarter, some of which we're not allowed to talk about, but eventually they'll be known. That we really had both an increase in the number of seats for the software and net new customers. So a very strong quarter for Deltek.","Our freight matching business also had phenomenal results. We had significant adds in net subscribers. And the market, the spot market is exceptional right now and we're certainly benefiting from that and expecting to have that trend continue.","CBORD actually grew in its food and nutrition management software business on these healthcare campus-type environments where they get multiple facilities. And that was a nice turnaround for us.","Toll and traffic grew low single digits, but did a very good job in terms of project execution, so they didn't \u2013 they had favorable variances.","And then we had double-digit growth from the customer service centers that we have and we're winning more and more business in that area. There's a lot more visibility today on the part of these people that are going out and soliciting work on customer service centers because some of the competitors have had significant challenges recently, and the competitive advantage of using TransCore has never been more apparent.","Just recently, the Governor of New York was talking about the incredible success of the cashless tolling project that we managed last year and into this year, which came in both below budget and on time. And if you look at a lot of the other projects people talk about in the transportation arena, you can never find those words, below budget, on time inside anybody's messaging.","We completed an acquisition and on boarded PowerPlan. Probably the easiest onboarding process we've ever had because of the nature of the work that PowerPlan does. They're very much on top of all the data, and it just made their conformance to our modeling very easy. It's certainly a industry-leading niche application software business that we'll talk about a little bit more about here on the next slide.","ConstructConnect continued to build muscle and expand into what we want to do with it. It's a great network business. We want to have it broaden out to more software, so it can serve larger clients with larger projects, and that's on track for where we expect it to be. In the second half of the year, you can see we're saying sort of 4% to 6% organic growth for this segment. About 25% of the segment remains in the tolling and back-office administration activity, but the other 75% are RF businesses and Software.","We'll get strong growth and cash performance out of the Software businesses in the second half. Toll and traffic will be low single-digits in the third quarter, only because it's got a tough comp with Saudi and the New York projects in Q3 that give us about a $9 million headwind, but we expect it to improve organically in the fourth quarter with the timing of the technology piece of the business, the tags and collection technology shipping.","All right, next slide. Here in this slide 12 is the PowerPlan acquisition. PowerPlan's a leading provider of software and solutions for asset-centric businesses. We'd like to talk about the business and the diligence process, but you got to \u2013 what somebody thinks as a telephone pole, but there's all kinds of things hanging on it. And from a tax and asset reporting requirement you got to know how much of that pole belongs to whom and as you might imagine it's a tedious, tedious process, and our software and solutions make that become much more operationally efficient.","It's required to meet tax strategies that people have that mitigates the compliant risk they would otherwise have and it improves their cash flow. So, it's an easy sale. It has strong competitive advantages with very high barriers to entry. I mean, the knowledge that you need to have to be able to help a client is quite substantial. They've got a great, diverse customer base with a 98% retention rate on customers.","The financial model is good and, as I indicated, it's going to be quite valuable for us because we're going to get a large deferred revenue balance once this thing is up and running inside our system. If you look at our acquisition criteria, which we occasionally publish, we said we want it to have strong cash flow characteristics; this business certainly does. We want it to be asset-light, meaning the net working capital would be modest, if any at all. We want it to have an excellent management team, which this does.","We want it to be in a niche that's highly defensible, and we want to have deep domain experience, which this business requires and fortunately has. We want to have a lot of recurring revenue, and we certainly have that with this business with the subscriptions and continuing long-term contracts. And then, we like it to have multiple growth opportunities, which this business has, both in the asset-heavy industries as well as some of the other opportunities.","Interestingly, if you sort of compare that to Gatan, which is a great business and you go through the same criteria: so strong cash flow, Gatan checked the box; asset-light, not so much, quite a few assets there for a Roper-type company; excellent management team, probably best-in-class really; niche market leader, absolutely, it couldn't get more nichey than Gatan; deep domain experience, many of the world's experts really are PhDs that are inside our Gatan business; high recurring revenue, no, almost no recurring revenue; multiple growth opportunities, well they're all focused around this emerging cryo-EM technology which is wonderful but it doesn't have multiple platforms, and it's certainly more cyclical. So, the trading out of PowerPlan and Gatan is very strategic for us.","Next slide. On Medical & Scientific Imaging here you can see revenue was up 7%, EBITDA margins came in at 41.5%, very strong growth and execution in the niche medical software businesses, the smaller ones which are Strata Decision Technology, Data Innovations, SHP, and SoftWriters. And all of those really performed very well and even Sunquest U.S. lab business was on target, (18:29) was down but it was where we expected it to be. So that was actually encouraging.","We had good market adoption of Verathon's new BladderScan technology which is kind of a breakthrough technology. And then the GlideScope consumables we introduced a while back have been growing quite substantially. Double-digit growth for the automated surgical scrub and linen technology business we have which they would say was a scrub excellent quarter. So, these guys are \u2013 you probably couldn't find a more passionate leadership team than the people at IPA in Atlanta, and that business is doing exceptionally well.","Very strong revenue contribution from the backlog in Scientific Imaging as it's starting to shift, so that certainly helped. Notwithstanding that, we're still going ahead with the sale of Gatan, which we expect to close before the end of the year. It's already cleared the U.S. requirements but it's still got things going on where people are looking at it in Europe.","High single-digit organic growth in the third quarter and then probably tapers down to mid-single digit growth in the fourth. The Medical businesses will grow single-digit, but we'll get some additional spike out of the Gatan and cryo-EM growth here in the second half of the year. We expect a strong Q3 results in Imaging because of that backlog.","Next slide, which will be slide 14. So Industrial Technology really is just spectacular. It's the only thing you could say. Revenue was up 20%. Operating profit was up 27%. Operating profit margins \u2013 these are manufacturing companies, folks \u2013 operating profit margins, 32%. EBITDA 33.8%, up 140 basis points. Organic growth, up 18%.","Another revenue quarter for Neptune, which had double-digit growth again, really driven by customer-focused innovation. We're just winning an awful lot where people see, hey, if I continue with Neptune and move into more collective technology I can still keep my installed base; I don't have to rip everything out and replace it. So Neptune continues to perform exceptionally well.","We've had meaningful share gains with our Cornell Pump business. It's had a great year, but it had certainly a very, very spectacular quarter. One of the things Cornell has benefited is dramatically increased market share with the rental companies, and that demand was really strong from an order perspective early in the year. We think that'll kind of taper out some in the fourth quarter in terms of shipments, but the orders we expect to be very strong as the rental fleets get replenished.","Roper Pump had very nimble execution in the quarter, so they had outsized growth. But when the whole place grows by 20%, there's really nobody you'd sort of single out to say they disappointed anybody, because they certainly \u2013 nobody disappointed, as everybody did spectacularly well.","We think we're continuing to have double-digit growth in the third quarter and then mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter only because the comps get more challenging. Very strong leverage that we'd get out of these businesses, which you can see in the numbers.","The Energy segment is a similar kind of story. Organic was up double-digit at 12%. The upstream application businesses \u2013 AMOT, Metrix, DES, (22:37) and Viatran \u2013 were very strong.","And then importantly, our Compressor Controls business, after being down and then sort of getting to the point of being flat, actually returned to growth in the quarter, and that's a much more long cycle business. So that's encouraging that that'll be coming up while maybe some other businesses would moderate.","The Industrial end markets are pretty strong in every category that we're in. So we still see Q3 with double-digit organic growth. And then Q4, similar to Industrial Technology, with kind of mid-single digit growth, strong leverage. Energy segment was up 16% on revenue and 28% on operating profit, so that's just a proof of the strong leverage. You can see EBITDA margins were 30.5% for the segment. So pretty spectacular.","Next slide. As we look at updating the guidance and we go to slide 16, the guidance update. We're raising the full-year guidance from $11.40 to $11.56 as a range \u2013 or we're creating it there at $11.40 to $11.56, that's up from $11.08 to $11.32. So at the midpoint it's up $0.28.","Organic revenue growth we're now raising to 7% for the second half of the year. Previously we'd said 4% to 6%. And third quarter guidance we established at $2.89 to $2.95.","Next slide. If you look at the summary then of this very, very good quarter, you can see that the niche market strategy and our ability to execute in a nimble way continues to deliver outstanding results. We had record results as we've covered throughout the talk, 9% organic revenue, everybody grew, gross margins up at 63.1%, demonstrates that we really aren't seeing these price cost issues or supply chain things from foreign tariffs.","Earnings before tax were up 17% and the diluted earnings per share \u2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 29% to $2.89. Operating cash flow was up 55%.","The asset-light diversified technology transformation that we've been doing for several years now continues. The PowerPlan acquisition sort of shows exactly the kind of assets that we'll be acquiring.","The agreement to divest Gatan strengths our balance sheet and gives us several-hundred-million dollars of additional capital to deploy, along with the repatriated money that's coming in. So the balance sheet is still in great shape.","We continue to see a lot of attractive acquisition opportunities, and the pipeline's pretty significant. So, we're looking at both large deals and some bolt-on things that we're fully \u2013 we've got our teams fully deployed on the acquisition side of opportunity.","Our cash return on investment discipline continues to prove that that's the best way to create shareholder value over the long period of time and compounding cash is what people should be looking at. So, we had an outstanding quarter, we've got great momentum, and let's open it up for questions. Hello? We're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Everyone.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I appreciate the fact you preempted all the price costs and tariff discussions because that's been tying up a lot of these conference calls. Maybe the first question would be some clarification on the 2018 guidance whether that includes PowerPlan accretion, and could you size that for us please?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Good morning, Deane. It's Rob. So, PowerPlan probably adds $0.12 to $0.13 to the second half, so that's included in the guide. We also if you look at the second half have a little bit of additional FX headwinds. We've included in there, probably $0.05 or $0.06. And a little bit higher interest cost on the fact that our revolver costs have gone up as the short-term LIBOR rates have gone up. So, that's all included in that second-half guide.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And what about PowerPlan's accretion to free cash flow? Sometimes you give that data point as well.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Sure. So I think when we made the announcement we said it was about a $60 million addition to cash flow on a first 12 month basis. So, that's without the financing costs. And so again here is where you \u2013 do you apply the cash from PowerPlan to that, do you apply interest rate, so we \u2013 as you know, sort of the corporate balance sheet is separate from the individual acquisition. So, the company will deliver $60 million, less the financing costs, however you want to apply that.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, some context on the Gatan divestiture. And, Brian, you and I have had discussions over the years about your willingness to part with this asset, and you're refrain always was, if someone wants to pay us the multiple that we need or would expect and looks like you got it at 18 times. And now I know Rob has insisted there's not a big portfolio review going on, I get that, and it doesn't look like there's any soft spots in the earnings today, but are there other cyclical businesses as you do this transformation that you might be able to exit similarly?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think what you have to do is when we went through that list of what to look for in an acquisition, that's the same list we would look at for anything we own, right? So, the Gatan, while it's certainly the best technology available in its area and has incredible great people in it, misses on a number of our things. Many of the other longer-term businesses don't miss on those.","So, let's take a pump company, if this got substantial spare parts that sort of offsets some recurring revenue stuff. Gatan has zero spare parts. Gatan is a business that was acquired in the 1990s by Roper at a time it wanted to go into areas that were scientific, really. We're not pursuing scientific areas; we're pursuing areas we feel we really know how to manage exceptionally well, and if there's any cyclical content we're totally on top of it. But Gatan's cyclicity can come out of the National Institutes of Health or Japanese investment, you can't do anything about that. And it's going to an owner where they have incredible synergies that we just don't have. So, it's a very good acquisition for the people that are buying it, and it's an appropriate sale for us.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But just to put you on the spot, Brian, are there other Gatans within the portfolio that you'd consider divesting?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","We really don't have anything that's as scientific as Gatan which has no recurring revenue. If there was some business we thought was going to require additional capital investment that was unattractive, we'd certainly look at it. But we don't really don't have anything immediately for sale. I will say this, because of the Gatan sale, there's been a whole lot of new inbound calls about various businesses because I don't think anybody believed we would ever sell anything.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Exactly. I appreciate all the color and congrats.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The cash flow has been a little bit lumpy, maybe a touch light in first quarter but very strong here in the second quarter, a nice catch-up. What do you expect for the year, maybe for the second half, and some of the moving parts there? You talked about the deal that's adding $60 million before on an annualized basis, but what's just high level, what to expect for the year, anything unusual?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, Steve. I think you're right. So, we did outline last quarter, right, the lumpiness in Q1 around some onetimers, when we got paid with some of the big TransCore projects and some cash onetimers. So, you're right, we made that up in the second quarter, really nice growth, and we'd expect strong growth in Q3 and Q4. So, when we get on the full year basis, we should be approaching double-digit growth for cash flow on a full-year basis. So, it should be pretty strong in the second half.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on kind of the Industrial trends and orders, anything to call out there? It looks all pretty solid. Anything out of the ordinary from a macro perspective on the Industrial side?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yes. So the book-to-bill and order performance in those segments where it matters Industrial we're actually 1.0 book-to-bill. So good orders in places like Neptune and Roper Pump, so that gives us more encouragement, as we mentioned, for continued another double-digit quarter in the third.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I think no question that the comps in Q4 are more difficult than focus (33:23), we had quite substantial growth in the fourth quarter of last year. That's why we're talking about kind of mid-single digit growth. Also, there was an interesting facet we've had market share gains with rental fleets this year particularly at Cornell, and they ordered earlier than normally this year.","So, we don't know if that will repeat itself in the fourth quarter. If it does, we might have some upside benefit there, but that's unusual. Usually they don't start placing significant orders 'til the year is underway and they have a firm view of what they think their demand will be. So, there's some variability there but it's only to the upside, I think.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Some good elaboration on PowerPlan, I wanted to go maybe a little bit further. Any specific levers with that name under Roper's ownership particularly that stands apart from how you view the majority of your acquisitions? And in particular you had the comment about multiple growth opportunities, maybe we could build on that and if there's any thought around opportunity for pricing for value.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, a couple of things. Let me just start by saying, one of the benefits that happens when we acquire any one of these companies that came out of private equity is this massive relief of their customer base saying, I've always wondered what was going to be the exit, who is it going to go to, is it somebody that's going to invest in the business for growth, is it going to pay attention to customer service and enhancements. So we know Roper's going to do all of those things. So that's a home run, and it creates a much easier end market sale discussion. That's proven out a lot in a place like Aderant with our legal software. It's proven out at ConstructConnect, and it's really going to prove at PowerPlan.","Now, as far as the sort of specifics around the multiple growth vessel, I'll let Neil talk a little bit about that.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. And good morning, Chris. So, I'd first start by saying the core of what they do which is the asset and tax accounting for these very asset-intensive end markets around utilities, power generation, energy, that just by itself is still very robust and vibrant. There's a number of new products the company is developing to continue to sell and cross-sell into that end market. Over the course of the last couple of years, they've also gone into some very close adjacent markets with some success, think oil and gas, a little bit less asset-intensive but nonetheless have similar issues.","Also, over the course of last couple of years they worked very hard at migrating their technology stack into the cloud which then enables them to do open an uplift opportunity where they migrate the existing on-premise customers to the cloud which is a net growth driver for PowerPlan like it is with Deltek. Part of that is because you're on boarding more responsibility for the tech stack but also, to your point, that gives you the opportunity to price a little bit more for value.","And then finally with this lighter-weight implementation in the cloud, they're able to go into entirely new markets; think retail manufacturing that have similar type issues. And they're able to sell the SaaS solution to a business owner of a problem versus a technology owner inside the organization. So it's a multiple set of growth drivers, and it's been that way with this business for the last few quarters and certainly continued into the second quarter of this year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","That sounds pretty good.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","(37:15) You've got an accounting change around operating leases. So it has a big effect on people's balance sheets. So you got a lot of people that have got new found interest in understanding every element of their operating lease programs, and PowerPlan's software helps them immeasurably there.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Sounds great. Thanks. Quick one on toll and traffic. How would you describe the opportunity relative to the more stark competitive differentiation you talked about for service orders? And you don't usually describe toll and traffic as just low single-digits growth as you did for the third quarter.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, it's a lumpy business. A lot of times it depends what the corresponding quarter a year ago was. And so it was outsized because of the start of the New York City transformation to cashless tolling. And then we had pretty big Q3 with Saudi last year.","I mean, the contract stuff is, we're very selective on what we'll take in terms of a new customer. So we're interested in customers where we're going to really improve their ability to execute, but not every customer is driven by that.","So we're going to be very selective on what we take. But we're getting double-digit growth, we think that's going to continue because all you got to do is pick up the newspaper or read about some of the horror stories of what our competitors have done to not be able to bring on anything new and wind up with millions of unpaid toll requests. So that kind of changes the competitive advantage we have because we deliver what we say we'll do; not everybody else does.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, just maybe parsing our the guide one more time. It looks like the guidance raise was primarily to beat this quarter as well as putting in PowerPlan, offset by FX. So there really isn't much of a change to the second half.","Brian, I thought your commentary around Industrial growth and where you could potentially outperform in the fourth quarter was interesting. I was wondering if you can maybe walk through the other segments and how you guys are thinking about growth in the second half of the year for each of the other segments.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think that we told you on balance it's about 7% organic growth. I think each one of those segments, I could go back and look at it.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I think \u2013 right.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","It's single digits, high single-digits. So I don't know what more you want, Joe.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, so a little bit more difficult comp in the third quarter of the RF on the tolling, as Brian mentioned. And then, a little bit more difficult comps in Q4 across some of the Industrial and Energy markets. And then we do have timing of those Imaging shipments are very heavy in Q3 so that drives that segment.","So yeah. I think we did tweak up the organic in the second half, probably 1 point versus previous guide. So there's a lot of gives and takes there to get you to the midpoint of our range.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Yeah. No, I just noticed that you guys were forecasting growth that was slightly lower in the second half versus the first half. And obviously, know the tougher comps in Industrial but just wanted to see if there were other puts and takes.","I guess my second question is, as you think about Gatan and the dilution from that business divesting into next year, can you just quantify that for us, so we have that number?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, so let me just correct what you just said because actually the second half growth we have almost exactly the same as the first half growth, right around 7% organic, which was the same as the first half.","So it is \u2013 now, one other point, we did have a very, very strong second quarter with Deltek, as we mentioned, some of the large shipments of new revenue or new recognition revenue on wins. And so some of that's probably a little bit bigger in Q2 than we originally would've had, expected that later in the year. But that would be the only other kind of one-timer.","In terms of the dilution, so we'll touch on that certainly next year, but right \u2013 we would hope to deploy that capital in due course. And you got to always think about if we're going to get after-tax proceeds we're going to redeploy that. And so, that's the right time to measure the impact of a divestiture.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Gordon (sic) [Giordano] (42:08) with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I wanted to ask, on Sunquest you say it came in line and that's good that you guys kind of \u2013 I think you've ring-fenced what that business is going to do near-term. So maybe, Neil, I was just curious as to the confidence in that \u2013 like in the future growth of that business, or how do you kind of weight that versus kind of this is the trend for the next couple of years?","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I would \u2013 when we first talked about the North American challenges Sunquest versus everything else, the rest of world of the diagnostic group, we introduced that a couple of quarters ago, we characterized this being a \u2013 it's got a couple of year issue, 2018 and 2019 issue. As we sit here today, a couple of quarters into it, I would say that continues to be the case and our belief.","The international piece continues to do well. The interconnectivity or middleware piece that connects lab instrumentation to lab software continues to do well. And the team has done a good job of framing the North American strategy and starting to put hands on keyboards around some new software we're going to develop, but that going to take time to actually get done and released. And we'd expect the general trend line to continue here into next year.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, on CCC, was that growth coming from new projects or is that more from maintenance work? And then I just had one last question on DAT. And just curious if there's any like block chain implications for that business or anything that they're working on there?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, there's certainly some new construction orders that are coming online for first time in a long time. A lot of the work is upgrade work, where people have been postponing various thing until they see a better market. And so, we've got a huge installed base. So, we're getting both upgrades and just general improvements in plans, and then some new construction orders which we think will pick up more throughout the next two or three years.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","And relative to your block chain question with DAT, it's just the nature of the DAT business, we're matching basically the supply and demand side of the spot trucking market in North America. It doesn't really connotate to a block chain orientation; that's more of a supply chain issue. So we do see more of block chain activity happening, for instance, in our iTrade business around the food supply chain, but not so applicable at DAT.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just my first question on Medical & Scientific Imaging, how are you thinking about margins in the second half? Were you sort of thinking they should be flattish? And then what kind of operating leverage, I guess, do you think we should see looking out beyond that? And then related to that, on Medical & Scientific Imaging, pro forma for the Gatan divestment, could you just remind us what the recurring sales mix will be in this segment?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Just so you understand something, Gatan doesn't certainly have any recurring sales, right? So, it's just pretty much all new business all the time. And we happen to be in an up cycle for Gatan because of new technology that we developed and took place (45:43) which the marketplace is accepting. Then if you look at the segment numbers, you've got to be careful here because we've got to have the declining situation in the U.S. lab business which is exceptionally high margin.","So, actually if we pulled that out and segregated it, the margins would be going up not down, because the growth is in businesses with higher margins. It's just that when you got a business whether extraordinary margins, if it's down 2% or 5%, it's hard for the rest of it to make it up. So don't confuse yourself with the idea that there's any degradation in margin enhancement in Medical because that's wrong; it's just the fall off of the U.S. lab business at extraordinary margins.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. So, the total of the segment \u2013 we have a better \u2013 I think still down in the second half but better than it was on the first half where it was down a little over 100 basis points.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I mean it's all the way down to 41.5% EBITDA margins here in the quarter, right?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, it'll be better in the second half.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, instead of down only slightly, I understand. And then Gatan, yes, I mean, I understand it's not recurring as you'd explained 20 minutes ago. I guess the question was just pro forma for it therefore, how much is the recurring share of the segment going up?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. So that segment's well over we call over 50% re-ocurring revenue and then it will go up from there, high-50s. That's the envelope, probably high-50s.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call."],"19057":["Roper Technologies, Inc.

Today\u2019s call is begin recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Diana. And thank you all for joining us this morning, as we discuss our fourth quarter financial results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast, and also on our website.","Now, if you turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.","Next slide: Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.","For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of three items: First, we completed the divestiture of Abel Pumps during the fourth quarter, resulting in a pre-tax book gain of $70.9 million; this was partially offset by an impairment charge of $9.5 million relating to an imaging investment we made in 2007. Second, a $4 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions made in 2015. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Finally, we have a $2.6 million inventory step-up expense relating to the acquisition of RF Ideas.","Now, if you please turn to slide four, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. So, we\u2019ll start off here with our Q4 results. They were flat to last year; we talk a little bit about that. At $948 million, it\u2019s exactly the same number as last year, but there is a lot of activity to get you there. We had another 2 points of FX headwind in the quarter and then the acquisitions net of the Abel divestiture offset the organic shortfall in Energy primarily.","The industrial and energy markets declined in the fourth quarter and really had less seasonal adjustment favorably in the fourth quarter than normally, and we\u2019ll talk about that when we get to that segment. But we had very strong growth in Medical and the RF segments. Our gross margins continued to escalate; they were up 190 basis points in the quarter to 61.8%. Our EBITDA margin also hit 35.9%, that\u2019s the EBITDA margin, not the gross margin. And EBITDA was up another 2% to $341 million, which is sort of an annualized run rate of $1,364 million. Our free cash flow was up to $261 million and is 140% cash conversion. And we also issued 5 and 10-year bond, which totaled $900 million in the month of December and deployed over $700 million in the quarter and some very attractive acquisitions. So, we enjoyed both, good execution in the quarter and terrific disciplined capital deployment.","Next slide: If we look at the income statement in the quarter, you can see that while the orders and the revenue were exactly the same as a year ago, no two businesses would have been the same. So, this was a case of watching the ducks on the pond, but a whole lot of paddling going on underneath it.","The book-to- bill at 0.98 is actually pretty good for a fourth quarter. Just to give you some sense of history, in 2011, our book-to- bill in the fourth quarter was 0.94; in 2012, it was 0.95; and in 2013, it was a flat 1 or 1.01; and \u201814 was 0.98; and this year was 0.98. So from a historical perspective, it\u2019s about what we would expect to see.","Our gross profit, as we said, was up 59.9% to 61.8%. And operating income, the margin was 30.1% and that absorbed 70 basis points of higher non-cash amortizations as acquisitions came in. The interest expense was up $5 million due to the bond issuance and a little bit more drawn at the revolver during the quarter. Net earnings were down 1% from a $187 million to $186 million, which you could see just from the interest.","Next slide: Here we shift into the full year enterprise results, so next slide. On the enterprise results, the whole point of the year really was our ability to demonstrate nimble execution in the field and then deploy capital in really a top acquisition market with great transactions. So, if you look at the records, everything once again was a record. We had the most orders, the highest revenue, the best margins, the highest net earnings, and the best EBITDA and cash flow of any year in our history. The growth was led by Medical and RF. We had continued margin improvement through the year. The gross margin was up a 140 basis points on a year to 60.7, and the operating margin was up 80 basis points to 29% operating profit margin, and of course EBITDA was higher.","A very strong cash flow, we were up 11% in cash flow for the year, and that was 26% of revenue. Our cash flow was also up 11%. And our cash conversion on a free cash flow basis was 132%. We deployed a $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2015 with almost entirely a focus on software and medical technologies. All of our acquisitions are really very high margin businesses; they are all asset light; they\u2019re very specific leaders in niche markets; and they have high recurring revenue and strong management teams at each one of these companies that we acquired. And on our recent acquisitions have been growing in excess of 10% a year which gives us as they become organic rather acquisitions, a benefit to our organic notes.","Next slide: If we look at this bridge, we put together I think really help people understand about the performance in the forward nature of what we\u2019ll do in 2016. If you look at the base revenue in 2015, it was $3,552 million and it ended the year $3,593 million but that\u2019s not the story, being up 1%. The story is that we had organic growth in our RF segment; we had organic growth in Medical; and we had substantial acquisitions, even though we divested Abel, which was $20 million plus revenue business.","So, those three components added 7% to our trailing revenue number of last year. But we had a 3% currency headwind, almost all of which was in the Energy and Industrial segments. And that 3% brought the number down and then we had $35 million of negative organic growth in Industrial, almost all of which was in Roper and FTI which are our upstream fluid handling businesses. And then we had $72 million negative organic in Energy, the vast the majority of which was again upstream, although in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t get the seasonal push that we normally would get. So, we had a little bit of fall off in the fourth quarter in the mid and downstream business. So, about 2.5% of the 3% negative organic in Industrial and Energy was related directly to oil and gas.","Also, something that gets us obscured a bit by the numbers is our organic growth in the first quarter of \u201815 was 6%, excluding oil and gas. And we actually grew 2% in the second, third and fourth quarter excluding oil and gas. So, those headwinds that we had to contend with in 2015 around oil and gas markets will be dramatically smaller in 2016 than they were this year, although there is still some real challenges. And the currency isn\u2019t going to be $104 million; it will be probably 80% less than that negative number.","Next slide: If we look at the outstanding margins, you can see on the left hand side the gross margins in 2013, we were at 58.6, and those were raised 70 basis points in \u201814 and then raised twice that a 140 basis points this year to 60.7. And our EBITDA margins in 2013 were 32.8; they were raised 100 basis points in \u201814 to 33.8 and another 80 basis points this year to 34.6. So, the continued margin expansion just comes really from a focus on our asset light businesses, being able to reinvest for growth for and themselves and we had great leverage throughout the enterprise, as a result.","Next slide: To get to really what\u2019s the core of our entire business model is compounding our cash flow. And this compounding you can see continues to be outstanding in a year where we really only had 1% revenue growth. Our free cash flow is up 11%; our free cash flow at $929 million is up $89 million from the $840 million. So, we had a great quarter in the fourth quarter with $269 million in cash but we had a terrific year with $893 million in cash, in our view still the best major performance. If you look at our cash guidance, you\u2019ll see our cash guidance tells a different story than the EPS guidance.","Next slide: If you look at the financial position of the Company, here you can see cash at the end of this past year closed down at $779 million, up from $610 million a year before and up from $460 million in 2013. Now, we\u2019ve deployed almost a third of that here in January to close the CliniSys acquisition which is a little bit over $250 million, and that happened in the month of January. We also upsized our revolver; our revolver use to be $1,500 million, our revolver is now $1,850 million, and you can see on our undrawn revolver, we have 1,670 million. So between cash and undrawn revolver is about $2.5 billion of powder there. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA 1,250 million of course will be -- that\u2019s not a pro forma number and it will continue to get bigger as the year goes on. But even at 1,245 million, our net debt to EBITDA is only 2; at the end of \u201813, it was 1.9. So, we\u2019ve done over a couple of billion dollars of acquisitions and only have net debt of about $500 million. So, we still have a great deal of ample liquidity to do anything we want to do in the acquisition front in 2016.","Next slide: Here we will start to look at the specific segment detail and outlook. Next slide: If we look at the four segments, the Energy segment; the Industrial; the RF; and the Medical segment, you will see that they all are -- performed phenomenally from an EBITDA and gross margin basis. So, even though you have a year where Energy and Industrial together came in at $1,333 million, which was down 12% from the prior year\u2019s 1,519 million, they still delivered 31% EBITDA margins in both years and both were over 50% in gross margins.","In our RF and Medical space, those guys were up 11% from $2 billion roughly to $2.260 billion and of course they have even stronger margins with 36% EBITDA for RF and 45% EBITDA for Medical. And the Medical and the RF businesses are now already 70% of our total EBITDA, even though all the segments have extraordinary margins.","Next slide: So, we will start first with Medical which is our largest segment. And here you can see in the quarter we had organic revenue of plus 3%, acquisitions of plus 12% and foreign exchange a negative 3%. The SHP and IPA acquisitions from \u201814 finally went to organic, and they delivered double-digit growth for us in this quarter. We had very strong sales out of nearly double digit with new product launches that we had talked about earlier in the year continuing to gain tracking. And our Northern Digital business had an outstanding year, were up more than 10% with very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","Atlas Medical which is small acquisition that we bolted into Sunquest in the fourth quarter, its integration activity is doing well and we expect that to contribute in 2016. And I\u2019d say, we should comment on completed all-time record year is just compounding their growth and everything going well in that arena.","In 2016 the way we see the year unfolding is that we will continue to be nimble. And when I say our operating leverage for the full year in Medical was 50%, so as these grow, they contribute outsized incremental gains for us. We think we will have mid-single digit organic growth in Medical throughout \u201816 and we think that will get stronger as the year goes on. Sunquest has a number of version changes and software release updates that are rolling out in the second half that will be quite beneficial. And then Strata, Data Innovations and SoftWriters which are growing rapidly, will become organic in the second half. Verathon and Northern Digital are going to continue to grow at a relatively high rate in \u201816. And then we closed on January 7th, the CliniSys acquisition in the UK which is European hospital laboratory software provider and it will add to our acquisition sales growth in 2016.","Next slide: Here we look at RF Technology. And RF Technology was up in the fourth quarter 4% organically and had a negative FX of a point and acquisitions and divestitures added 15%. So, their revenue was up 18%, operating profit up 30%, and the operating profit margin 31.1%. Software throughout the segment performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter, as we returned to pretty good growth at iTrade and double-digit growth of Freight Matching. Aderant was acquired in October and it\u2019s off to a great start with the Aderant team. And in fact some of us are working with them in terms of coordinating some of large clients, being more secure going in with Aderant in the future as opposed to the fact that they were run by private equity in the past.","Toll and traffic projects are progressing really quite well, Riyadh is doing alright, although the startups in traffic in Riyadh tend to be a more civil engineering at the beginning, before we get all the software revenue, but they\u2019re still fine. And our Infinity Lanes that we\u2019ve been rolling out in Florida and Texas are on schedule and contributing substantially.","We think we\u2019ll have mid-single-digit organic growth for the year with stronger growth in the second half for RF, primarily because TransCore is finally out of an arrangement where we were providing tolling administration in Puerto Rico, and that\u2019s been quite a challenge in last half of this past year and will be completely out of our business model this year. So, it\u2019s a little bit dilutive to our revenue, but it\u2019s very much accretive to our sanity as trying to get money out of Puerto Rico as you know is not an easy task. But that will put a drag on revenue in the first two quarters about 10 million bucks each quarter, but that\u2019s revenue we\u2019re happy to avoid.","Our operating leverage for the segment by the way in 2015 was up 56%. So, here again as we get incremental revenue and we expect to have that in 2016, you\u2019ll see continued margin enhancement. The software businesses, we think will grow at kind of mid-single-digits, but they do have exceptional margins that allow us to use cash to reinvest in other transactions. And then the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve had Aderant, RF Ideas and On Center are all growing at a pretty strong rate and they have excellent cash flow performance and eventually they too will become organic.","Next slide: If we look at Industrial Technology, here in the fourth quarter, organic revenue was down 8%. It\u2019s all pretty much all oil and gas upstream with our businesses that are related to that. To get some context about this, in 2014, the oil and gas portion of Industrial Technology was about 12% of revenue and unlike RF where it\u2019s zero and Medical where it\u2019s zero. And Industrial Tech was 12% \u201814, and this year that dropped down to 9% of revenue; and in our forecast for \u201816, we think it will be down about 6% of revenue in the segment. It\u2019s almost exclusively upstream activity for surface and water pumping projects.","We also had the divestiture which came full circle with Abel with about in the low-20s of revenue that contributed nothing in the fourth quarter of this year, and of course will be out all of next year. Neptune grew really quite well double-digit growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The Toronto project was still there as a headwind as we told last year, it\u2019s closed to 10 million a quarter. But it finally sunsets in the first quarter of next year. So, Neptune\u2019s growth in 2016 will be outsized compared to the way it has looked with the Toronto headwind in the past.","We\u2019re forecasting continuing declines really in the upstream oil and gas. It was off about 30% for 2015 and we think it will be off another 30% in 2016, but of course it gets to be down to a smaller number. So, it\u2019s about a $20 million headwind for the segment going into 2016. And the rest of the businesses we think will grow at kind of low-single-digit numbers, maybe a little bit better than that.","So we go to the next slide. I should say that OP leverage and Industrial for the year, it deleveraged 40%. So with gross margins about 50 and delevering at 40, we think that was pretty good performance.","Next slide: On Energy Systems & Controls, they had this continued fall off, as one would expect, particularly in the upstream arena. Their operating leveraging for 2015 though was really quite good, negative 39% and their gross margins were 58%. So, I think everybody performed quite nimbly, although in the fourth quarter Compressor Controls started to see really deep dive on their project work and hadn\u2019t really restructured around that yet, and that activity will happen here in the first quarter. So, they contributed terrifically over the last several years but are going to have to face the reality of a major decline in project work. It\u2019s not going to reoccur for some long period of time.","Now, in the quarter, organic growth then was off as you can see 17%, FX by 4%. Our seasonal improvement actually did occur sort of as we forecasted, just not quite as much. We were up 9% seasonally in the fourth quarter energy, but normally were up kind of 17% to 20% and occasionally 25% in the fourth quarter. So, we had thought we\u2019d be up maybe 15% in the fourth quarter and by only coming up that kind of pulled back our revenue tad in the fourth quarter which was direct result of being little less revenue than we expected out of that. Certainly, backlogs are reduced in the segment, and that oil and gas project businesses are kind of rapidly deteriorate, although that\u2019s not a surprise. The unbelievable growth in Zetec as both South Korea and Japan and Middle East are roaring back and in fact we are up quite dramatically in Zetec and we think that will accrete to very strong performance for Zetec in 2016. The operating margin which really speaks to the nimbleness of the operating people we have in these businesses was still 32.7%, even though the segment was down substantially in revenue.","As we look at what we are talking here for 2016, you can see sort of high single-digit organic decline for the segment; oil and gas we think will be down about 15%, which will be about $50 million drag on the settlement, so about $20 million out of is Industrial and about $50 out of Energy. The project activity is going to be force Compressor Controls to do some aggressive restructuring. And I know that it\u2019s a challenge for everybody but there is no question, the market requires us to do that. And then we think we\u2019ll have modest growth in the rest of the areas in the industrial and nuclear arena.","Next slide: So, here is we get into the 2016 guidance. Next slide: We created another bridge for you here for 2016, so you get a sense of what\u2019s really going on and the health of the overall business. You can see, we finished this last year \u201815 at $3,593 million. We expect revenue to be up between 8% to 10% in 2016 and we think organic revenue will be between 2% and 4% in the coming year. So, we\u2019ll get mid single-digits organic growth out of RF and mid single-digit organic growth out of Medical. I think we\u2019ll have a low single-digit organic growth out of Industrial whereas last year you might remember, it was negative number. And then already completed acquisitions net of the Abel divestiture are going to contribute sizeable portion of revenue in 2016. We think we\u2019ll still have the high single-digit organic drop in Energy but that\u2019s a big improvement over last year\u2019s organic drop. And in foreign exchange which was a $104 million last year is probably going to be about 80% less headwind for us in 2016, so maybe something in the $20 million to $25 million arena. And that makes just as we showed you, we grew last year\u2019s 7% until you hit the oil and gas number. Just easier comps throughout the year for us once we get past the first quarter.","Next slide: So, if we look at the 2016 guidance, you can see for the full year, we\u2019re saying operating cash flow, we would hope would meet or exceeded $1 billion. And operating cash flow is going to have just a very limited CapEx drag for it to convert to free cash flow. This past year, I think CapEx was $36 million; we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be any higher than that this year; so, certainly less than 1% of revenue, probably quite a bit less than 1% of revenue.","Full-year adjusted DEPS we\u2019re saying are $6.85 to $7.15. And the key assumptions around that is we get for the full year revenue growth of 8% to 10%, organic growth of 2% to 4%, comps ease after the first quarter, and in the first quarter we\u2019ve got a lot of headwinds. So, we\u2019ve got revenue drag out of Puerto Rico, we\u2019ve got oil and gas had not really hit us in the first quarter of last year, and then we had some unique revenue coming out of Roper Pump; that won\u2019t continue, and we\u2019ve got little higher interest cost because of the bigger drop with acquisitions but we also get benefit in earnings. But Q1 last year at 6% organic and the last three quarters had 2% organic, so we certainly don\u2019t expect 6% organic net of oil and gas in the first quarter.","Our non-cash amortization increases by $30 million, so our non-cash amortization will be a $195 million in 2016. And if you want to use cash earnings, you can add that back to the net earnings number. Interest expense is about $25 million higher than last year to $109 million. Our tax rate is going to be somewhat similar to this past year in the 30% to 30.5% arena. And of course none of these includes any new acquisitions and we do expect to be pretty active in 2016 and add in additional high quality businesses.","In the first quarter we are going to establish guidance at $1.42 to $1.47 because of those things that we have to face in the first quarter that what were not at the end of last year. But we\u2019ll get improvements throughout the year on those things with quite dramatic improvement in the second half, which is not based on hope but just the reality of when we know to be the case.","Next slide: As we look at 2015 summary and then the outlook for the year, we delivered record annual results for orders and revenue and margin and net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow in \u201815 and that was despite probably the biggest headwind period we had with so much coming from currency and oil and gas. Our operating cash flow was up 11%, free cash flow also up 11%.","We had terrific margin improvement with gross margins up 140 basis points to 60.7%. EBITDA margin is up 80 basis points to 34.6%. And free cash flow at $893 million represented 25% of every dollar of our revenue and 132% cash conversion versus the DEPS number. We deployed $1.8 billion in really attractive acquisitions and we increased our dividend by 20%.","As we go into this year, we expect to deliver record performance in \u201816 with that revenue growth we mentioned just the slide before, 8% to 10%; operating cash flow around $1 billion. We think we\u2019ll deploy well over $1 billion in acquisitions that can easily be higher than that. And we\u2019ve already closed our first one with CliniSys for about $250 million in January. We\u2019ve got a very attractive pipeline. We are looking at a transaction on Friday and another one on Monday. And so, there is just a great deal of activity going on, probably the most that we have ever seen in terms of pipeline. We continue to compound cash, increased shareholder value last year, you got a lot of alpha [ph] off us in 2015. And we\u2019re just going to think we can continue to increase our cash as we look at 2016.","So with that John, I think we are ready for questions.","John Humphrey","I think so. So Diana, we are ready for the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instruction] Now, we will take our first question from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of UBS.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Brain, just on the assumptions on the oil and gas of the down 30 for Industrial Tech, and down 15 for Energy, maybe just explain a little bit more the differences between those two decline rates, and then some of the other businesses around the oil and gas stuff within the energy segment that you have a better outlook for.","Brian Jellison","Well, in industrial, basically Roper Pump is almost exclusively oriented around upstream oil and gas. So, it\u2019s not a huge business but it has a big, big drawback when you have change in tracking and it\u2019s primarily U.S. business. So, if oil and gas component was down 30% in \u201815 from \u201814 and we expect it will be down another 30% in \u201816 \u201815, but it\u2019s still fairly small number. So, it\u2019s about $20 million revenue drag that we\u2019re modeling into \u201816. None of the other businesses in Industrial Technology have anything to do with oil and gas. They\u2019re instrument companies or over half is the Neptune and water meter business which is going to grow next year. So, it\u2019s just that one isolated. And there is no midstream and downstream activity really in Industrial.","When you get into Energy much, much bigger total dollars of what you are talking about, about 60% of the segment is oil and gas, but only some of it is upstream, primarily upstream portion or couple of very small businesses, Viatran and little bit of Amont [ph] and then quite a lot of Compressor Controls. So, Compressor Controls has been living off of a great project backlog. Their service work we expect could be a record this year in 2016, but we think their project work will drop really dramatically, it could drop $30 million to $40 million. And the midstream and downstream activity for the year has been really decent all the way along; the only drag has been the currency. But then in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t get as much of a seasonal uptick in those downstream businesses as we normally do, so mostly testing businesses. So that bodes for slight deterioration, probably in \u201816. The rest of the Energy businesses, the 40% are really mostly test and measurement kind of businesses and then were up really sharply at Zetec. So that helps offset -- that\u2019s we are saying 15% for Energy but it\u2019s 30% for the upstream portion of Industrial.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","And then within Industrial in terms of getting from organic declines to starting to grow there again, what is the Toronto comp impact; what was it in 4Q; what is it in 1Q? And then what\u2019s driving that double-digit Neptune growth; I mean is that kind of a sustainable rate or what\u2019s the\u2026","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s certainly going to be very solid growth in 2016. It\u2019s about $10 million dividend [ph] each quarter for the Toronto project as it\u2019s fell off. There is a little bit of revenue we are still getting out of Toronto for last minute adjustments but it\u2019s not very meaningful. It\u2019s just domestic growth in commercial water meters and new wins in projects. We are going to have some -- I mean we are having share gains that are really obvious to us when we look at the data and we are going to have further share gains in 2016 that we are confident of based on all of our contacts and with our bid process.","John Humphrey","Yes. Shannon, Toronto project really completed substantially in the first quarter of 2015. So, it\u2019s still kind of in that $10 million comp range in the fourth quarter against the fourth of \u201814 and it will have a little bit of a headwind in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. But then after that it\u2019s going to be more normalized. So it\u2019s not an acceleration that we\u2019re looking for; it\u2019s really some headwinds that start to go away.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I\u2019d like to go back on to the oil exposures for Industrial and Energy, and just talk about if you could your visibility in the businesses, specifically around orders in the quarter. And then on the organic assume declines; maybe discuss what volume versus pricing. There is a lot of supplier squeezing that\u2019s going on in the sector and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see if you\u2019re seeing some pricing pressure as well.","Brian Jellison","Well, if you talk of ourselves, I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s massive pricing, but there is no pricing pressure. That\u2019s not the issue at all, just pure -- the biggest component of course is currency, but then from a unit situation, it\u2019s the project work at Compressor Controls this year. It\u2019s really easy to detail that out. So, those numbers are pretty good. Last year, we actually said when we initiated guidance, we thought upstream would be down about 20%. You correctly challenged us about CapEx is down 30, might it not be down 30, and we said well it could be down more than 20, but we thought we had a particular arrangement around surface drilling, which is new technology, which has rapidly gained share and it was doing that at the time and we thought that would continue in the second quarter. But in the second quarter, they basically stopped all ordering and consumed all inventory they could and that hurt us a little bit. And then in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t get any seasonal bounce -- well we did, but not as much as normally would. So, we\u2019re very comfortable around guiding down 20 million on oil and gas, and industrial and around 50 million in energy. I think that\u2019s quite correct.","And then, there would still be a little bit more drag on a nominal number basis with currency, but it\u2019s definitely not pricing. And the guys have been pretty correct, all year along except for that Q2 situation Roper Pump where our supply agreement got suspended for that quarter.","Deane Dray","What were orders in the quarter for both?","Brian Jellison","The segment book-to-bill was like 0.88 for energy in the fourth quarter.","John Humphrey","And it was 0.97 for industrial. So on the industrial side that 0.97 is the kind of typical for a fourth quarter, but it\u2019s definitely wider. So you asked about visibility also. So for the products businesses, particularly around upstream and even on the mid \u2013 downstream, those are generally going to be book and ship inside of a relatively short window, two months or so. Where we do have better visibility and where we\u2019re talking more about this is on the Compressor Controls, right because it\u2019s more of a project business and that\u2019s where we saw an order shortfall in the fourth quarter leading to that 0.9 book-to-bill area, and why we\u2019re expecting that to be a tough year for the project based business, because we have good visibility in that area.","Deane Dray ","Brian, your referenced back in the second quarter some of our expectations that upstream could be worse. Just to kind of give you a data point, we had launch on Friday with the CEO of Schlumberger and their expectations is upstream could be down 35%. So, we\u2019re in that right neighborhood. And just last question for me would be these businesses, so we talk about Roper Pumps or Compressor Controls; these are legacy Roper Industries businesses and certainly not something that you would be looking to invest in today. Now, in the teeth of the oil pressures here, certainly not a time to talk about divesting, but would there be an opportunity at some point to separate the Roper Industry legacy businesses from Roper Technologies, where you\u2019re focusing today?","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s certainly possible; we talk about it quite a lot. And there are a lot of different avenues for achieving that. It could be spun off as an independent entity where people would be able to make kind of one-for-one decision about whether they wanted to be in that space as an investor and it could be put together with another business and some kind of merger. Again, it\u2019s not something we would likely sell, because the tax [indiscernible] sale is just pretty prohibitive. And the businesses are very good. I mean the oil and gas businesses, we put the whole thing together, and they have an EBITDA margin of 34%. And they don\u2019t take a lot of assets; they are very, very cash accretive to our number. And for those people who like EPS, they give us terrific EPS, because there is no amortization. But you\u2019re right. I mean it\u2019s something we\u2019re always going to look at. And certainly there have been more than one phone call in-bound about people who like to do something, but selling them is not the best thing for our investors, finding tax free alternative to that would be more attractive.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen & Company.","Joe Giordano","So, what I\u2019ve been trying to get with everyone\u2019s guidance is kind of separate how much is the progression throughout the year is, anticipating a market upturn like an underlying market upturn and how much is specific to the company as cadence of revenue that\u2019s already in hand, orders that you already have in hand. So, how do you separate your expectations with better second half versus what you know and what you are hoping?","John Humphrey","It\u2019s a whole lot more of what we know and what we hope. We don\u2019t really have very many businesses, only one or two that have any tide at something that\u2019s kind of a larger macro in the markets. The markets that we serve are so niche. They end up being more driven by our activity around new products or new software releases rather than hope for some macroeconomic recovery. We are not really expecting any of that; that\u2019s not something that we try to forecast. It really doesn\u2019t drive many of our businesses. But it\u2019s not as simple as orders in hand because we really don\u2019t have orders in hand for products or for activity that\u2019s going to jump in the third quarter or fourth quarter. So, we\u2019re not a projects type of E&C business like that. But it\u2019s really around things that we know that we\u2019re going to able to introduce to the niche markets that we serve and again new products growth in those areas.","Joe Giordano","And then as you look at your pipeline into 2016, what have you seen in terms I guess across the various sectors that you play in, and in terms of bid ask spreads and how they are moderating or how they are moving, which areas are looking increasingly more attractive or increasingly less so in terms of valuation?","John Humphrey","In terms of acquisitions?","Joe Giordano","Yes.","John Humphrey","The bid ask spread is wide, it\u2019s always wide. We were able to deploy $1.8 billion last year and we\u2019ve already got a quarter of $1 billion done now. So, we don\u2019t anticipate any difficulty at all. I do think that the notes out today are interesting. So, there weren\u2019t any IPOs in January. So, if you were a seller of private equity, you might continue to say whatever you think somebody is going to listen to. But the reality is their debt costs are going up and their active strategies are diminishing. We remain the best mid market acquirer of assets on the face of the earth. So, we are not going to have any difficulty in finding high quality businesses at rational prices.","Joe Giordano","At what point does it -- do you start looking -- you guys are ahead of getting away from some of these energy industrial type of applications into where you are with your medical businesses? At what point do you start to look opportunistically a little bit more aggressively at some of these sectors that have been down a little bit more?","John Humphrey","What we always look at is the cash return we can get out of an investment. And so what happens is it\u2019s hugely difficult for an industrial asset to have the kind of cash returns that we are going to demand. But whenever we see them, we are willing to make investments in those. We bought a pure product company in RF Ideas this year which is just a world class business with terrific leadership, very high margins, relatively light assets but they are certainly making stuff and they are selling stuff. So, it depends on the quality of what it is we see. But we would never buy something at a public market deep discount. Let\u2019s say some energy business dropped 30%, we wouldn\u2019t buy something because it dropped 30%; we would only buy something because its forward cash returns were extremely attractive. And as generally as a rule, people overpay for low quality assets under the theory that they are going to find some way to make it better. So, we\u2019ll leave the buying of distressed assets to others. We want to buy businesses that have consistent growth and recurring revenue and light assets models. And we haven\u2019t seen any other than RF Ideas. We haven\u2019t seen anything in the last two years in the Industrial segment that qualifies for that.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Brian, could you just speak for a minute or two to the medical segment in general? Again, given the \u201816 guidance, mid single-digit growth and the core order growth of 7% in the fourth quarter, it looks little attractive. Is there anything in the mix to be alert for in \u201816 between medical products and software and imaging when you are talking about mid single-digit growth either of those or any of those kind a leading core growth and could give us an upward bias on the margin line for medical?","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s a good question. Sorry, I have to dissect it. Remember that in the medical and software, we have a huge amount of recurring revenue, right? So, the recurring revenue, it\u2019s not going to grow by a higher number. So, when we say mid to high single-digit that has to be something that takes a whole segment into consideration. So, the product portion in the new software sales have to be higher than that in order to get the whole segment up to mid single-digits. I don\u2019t think that there is any -- certainly Sunquest in the second half of the year should have outsized growth to what it had throughout 2015 because we had the meaningful use improvement in \u201814 and the beginning of \u201815 that is a comparative drag and that will go away as \u201816 matures. I don\u2019t think there is really any particular driver we -- in the medical software -- in the software businesses and RF component, there some drivers that have had escalating growth. I don\u2019t know John, if you want to add anything.","John Humphrey","No, I don\u2019t think so. So, I think it really will be. We expect \u201816 to be led by more higher V [ph] on the medical product side with some continued new product introductions; we introduced some things at Verathon in the latter part of \u201815 so those start to really ramp up. We have other new products that are being introduced to the market as well, as well as continued growth around some image-guided surgery applications that Northern Digital continues to just perform phenomenally well on. And then as Brain mentioned, in the software and services side that\u2019s kind of a mid-single digit grower anyway because of the huge amount of recurring revenue. And that\u2019s what we expect in the latter part of \u201816. We are not expecting a whole lot of recovery at all in the imaging world. I think that\u2019s expected to be flat to maybe up a little bit.","Richard Eastman","And then just one last question, John, when you kind of speak to \u201816 overall, again we -- we all have our estimates as to what acquisitions completed will contribute to the EBIT line. But on that 2% to 4% core growth, what\u2019s just kind of a mid-point conversion rate that we should see on the 2% to 4% for the core business?","John Humphrey","Conversion, you mean like leverage?","Richard Eastman","Yes, to the EBIT line?","John Humphrey","It\u2019s not a come up to your own, we expect that to be somewhere in the 40% to 50% range.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Robert McCarthy of Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","So, two questions, one is just kind of the old chestnut that people asked about Roper and M&A. And clearly, given the environment we are seeing, and I guess one of the cofounders of Apollo [ph] just talked about the financing markets shutting down and the sky is falling. But in terms of just coming back to that question, is there particular types of companies that you are kind of looking at now that really lend [ph] themselves to be acquirer in these environments for really there is a crowd out of traditional private equity and really you can kind of sweep in besides just normal, is there particular vertical or end market where you are really well-positioned or well-advantaged? And does this allow for bigger deals of size or of a certain deciles and shaking out this environment?","Brian Jellison","Well, it is certainly true that there -- on things that are relatively large in potential acquisitions, maybe there will be less competition for those assets as the year unfolds, than there have been in the last three years. I noticed on some of the large things that we looked at, if they get bought back private equity, it isn\u2019t one fund, it\u2019s three guys going together. But debt staples were still out there. I mean we are looking at a deal Friday that has a six and half times debt staple. So, as long as debt staples are that high and we wouldn\u2019t use it, the private equity is going to use that. They can put in four turns at EBITDA and you are still 10.5 times EBITDA. So, that kind of businesses that we acquire, they were public, they tend to trade at 25 times enterprise value to EBITDA or more. I know it\u2019s hard for people to follow that because they\u2019re looking at traditional multi-industry stuff but multiples are dramatically less.","So, we are going to continue look at these things are with a great deal from an arbitrage perspective in a public market versus what we have to pay for them. And those tend to crowd out the lesser quality businesses where people pay eight, nine 10 times for something that\u2019s worth 10. And we tend to pay 11 and 12 times for something that\u2019s worth 25 and that\u2019s really how we get all this out for performance, consistently over a long period time and that\u2019s going to continue.","Last year we did something that I wouldn\u2019t have forecast which is we did six or seven deals to get the $2 billion; we would have rather done $1.5 billion deal and a $500 million deal. But the small deals were unbelievably compelling and they are all growing double digits. So, I think it was a good thing to do. We are still seeing a lot of those kind of opportunities. So, as the year unfolds, it will be a battle between sort of saving our powder for really large transaction and we\u2019re going ahead and investing early on things that are somewhat modest. At the end of the day for our shareholders, the result is about the same. It\u2019s just easier for us to do a large deal than five small deals. But it should be an easy year for us to deploy capital, very favorable.","Robert McCarthy","And as a follow-up, I mean just obviously in ramping up coverage of you all again after a long dormancy. The cash return on investment kind of metric you use and kind of animates your M&A and capital redeployment strategy obviously makes a heck lot of sense. And I certainly have drunk the Kool-Aid with respect to the discipline around it. I think the most important epiphany coming out of it is basically the strategy and the metrics are kind of completely aligned. In another words, you don\u2019t stretch for what is perceived as a strategic deal, because a strategic deal\u2019s one which meets the metrics, right? So, I just the only question I have is, where do you think there are risks to the CRI discipline or maybe the businesses you\u2019re looking at? Do you think it\u2019s may be an assessment of the code? I know you use a third-party consultancy to kind of look at the -- kind of related intellectual property and software and association with deals, and there can be obviously risk there, can be risk of technological substitution. Maybe you just talk about where you just level headedly think about the risks in association with your capital redeployment strategy?","Brian Jellison","Well, let\u2019s maybe just for a second, if we have think about risk in general, if you look at transactions, because people were asking questions about when we buy some cheap stuff. So, the cheap stuff in industrial and there is all kinds of stuff and their public stocks are going to continue to deteriorate, and you could buy them. Hey, what\u2019s wrong with those as they can get working get disintermediated from distribution channels. They can wind up with the premium model out of Google on some bizarre thing; they wind up with Amazon selling past their competition at low-price point. So all kinds of things that happen, they desperately need absorption. So if revenue falls off, there is nothing they can do without big restructuring charges.","When we get to our space, it\u2019s really around whether or not the people in the niche that we acquire have domain expertise, which is very hard for somebody to break into. And so, the entry barriers for their success are entirely different. So, the risk is that we continue to assess the quality of the management teams that we acquire well and we understand whether or not there are technologies that could leapfrog what they do. So that we spent most of our time around the people aspects of the business and then around big risks that those people don\u2019t see that we would put kind of a different factor on. We tend to discount their forward growth projections, because we don\u2019t pay for synergies or forward growth, we only pay for what we think the business is going to deliver at the time of the acquisition. And that really puts a huge dampening effect on the risk that we might otherwise have. And we\u2019ve been kind of blessed to be fortunate in that arena. But I think our disciplines are such because we actually start with somebody\u2019s balance sheet and then we start with what it takes to run the business. We don\u2019t do like what a private equity people do, they\u2019ll buy a software company and they\u2019ll mandate an immediate 10% reduction. One of the private equity firms out there actually goes in and does a listing up the highest pay people and they whack off the highest paid people and put new college guys and big salary reductions. And then that kind of hideous serious activity doesn\u2019t manifest itself in the business for four or five years. So, you have to understand what each private equity groups business model is when you\u2019re looking at the assets they hold and you\u2019re acquiring it and I think we knew that better than anybody.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Just wondering, in medical here the product cycles in the devices seems to be coming on pretty well. I wondered Northern Digital, Verathon, you look at hose to be able to climb for double-digit rate at some point and are the product cycles that have been notable the past few quarters, is that sort of a couple of year dynamic do you think?","Brian Jellison","Yes, I do think so. What we\u2019re really seeing out of Verathon is a refresh. So, it\u2019s not a completely new product category, which actually reduces the risk for us. These are really upgrades and extensions of their existing live scope like in 2015 in BladderScan and 2016. So those are kind of a couple of year adoption rates that go on there. Northern Digital doesn\u2019t have to get up to double-digits; they just have to continue double-digit growth. They\u2019ve been growing at double-digits here for couple of years, as they\u2019re really the leader in both the optical tracking as well as the electromagnetic tracking for computer assisted surgery applications. And those continue to just expand. Those applications just expand. And whenever there is new that an OEM customer wants to design, they always come back in Northern Digital because they\u2019re the world leaders in that technology.","Christopher Glynn","And then just if there is any room left there, so wanted to expand on Rob\u2019s question a little bit where you had a record year last year in deal flow and talked about I think record pipeline volume or breadth. Have you transitioned more kind of wholeheartedly to CRI and is increasingly tolerant definition of strategic part of the reason why your pipeline and your yield has kind of accelerated to somewhat unpredictable levels?","Brian Jellison","No, no. Let\u2019s go back and think about with -- reason I said some time ago that the Sunquest and question MHA acquisitions were more transformational than the Neptune and TransCore transformations were. Because at Neptune we paid four times EBITDA of the enterprise in December of 2003 to acquire Neptune at what somebody probably thought was a high price for $500 million. The next year in 2004, we just paid about four times again the trailing revenue of the firm, 3.5 or something, for TransCore, 600 million. Well, neither one of those businesses have lend themselves to adding exciting bolt-on activities to them or giving new domain experience in an area that was easily widened. When you acquire a leading laboratory software provider in a world that\u2019s going to have more and more laboratory instrument usage and will move to genomics in the immediate future, you have big upside ramp. When you have MHA with senior living and nursing homes and all the things around non-acute hospitalization shifts and demography, these things just give you all kinds of opportunity. Well good heavens, we have acquired now SoftWriters for MHA which is growing at double-digits, so it\u2019s a terrific acquisition. We\u2019ve been able to acquire CliniSys which we connect really with Sunquest. We acquired Data Innovations which is phenomenal company that guides all the instrumentation in the hospital into various systems and yet it\u2019s part of Sunquest.","So, that\u2019s why we can look at these things which are somewhat synergistic at least in the marketplace or in the information technology side of them that we couldn\u2019t do with the industrial and energy businesses.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you. And thank you all for joining us. I know there were a couple of folks on line for follow up questions; we will get back to you as soon as we can. Otherwise, we\u2019ll look forward to talking t everyone in three months, at the end of the first quarter.","Operator","That will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Robert Crisci, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Robert Crisci","Thank you, Jay, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, John Humphrey, Paul Soni and Neil Hunn.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also are available on our website, www.ropertech.com.","If you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Now, please turn to Slide 3. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.","For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items. A $22 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions and $2 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commission that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Lastly, a $72 million pre-tax adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.","And now, if you please turn to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. We will start by going through the first quarter enterprise results and then look at the specific segment detail for each of our 4 reporting segments and then talk about how we see the second quarter and the rest of the year and take your questions.","So if we turn to the next Slide, Slide 5. We look at the Q1 enterprise results fundamentally, of course, our record first quarter for everything you can think of, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow. Our revenue was up about 22% in the quarter to $1.108 billion and of that 5% was organic. Really broad-based growth, which we'll talk about in all 4 segments and specific improvements in our industrial and energy end markets.","In February, we were at an investor conference and audience question, whether what could go wrong or what's still difficult and I said then, that there really \u2013 we didn't see any difficulties, there are continuing headwinds of the business that were meaningful, and I'm sitting here two months later and I have to get the same answer to that question, and we see really a breakout here for Roper in 2017.","The DEPS were up 17% to $2.11. EBITDA was up 18% to $362 million. Our operating cash flow was up 55% to $378 million, and you don't want to be confused about the fact that last year, there was an even lower number that would make the operating cash flow look even higher because we had an adjustment around an out-of-period tax situation with the ABEL sale and record the fourth quarter, that was a $37 million adjustment. So we're quite content with being up 55% on that adjusted operating cash flow number the year before. The $378 million, we'll talk more about that during the course of the morning.","Both Deltek and ConstructConnect came out of the box very well and have probably even more upside potential in 2018 and 2019 than we originally have forecast. We had a very interesting week-long strategic conference with all of our industrial and energy business leaders last week in Sarasota. That's the first time we've got everybody together in one large meeting for a couple of years. And the amount of product vitality that, that group's put together in the last couple of years during a more difficult economic time is really refreshing and all of those folks are very, very excited about returning to a growth forward nature, so that's good news.","Next Slide. We look at the income statement. For the first quarter, you'll see the revenue at $1.108 billion versus $906 million last year. Gross profit, up 10 basis points to 62.2%. EBITDA, at 32.7% is down a little bit on a margin basis, but of course, up 18%. And that's just Deltek and ConstructConnect and the acquisition is coming in initially with a loop sort of looks like with less EBITDA on a margin basis. Tax rate in the quarter was 28.2%. We had a $7 million discrete item that we were aware of that we were going to get the benefit sometime during the year, but it actually hit just right in the quarter all of it. And you can see the detail. I'll tell you about what the GAAP rate was and what the amortization rate was when we apply 35% to that amortization. The net earnings then were $218 million and DEPS, as you can see, was $2.11.","So next Slide. If we look at the cash flow side, this is sort of nothing short of spectacular. We had an exceptional first quarter although I would remind everybody that in the chart, you can see $888 million trailing 12 months of the end of quarter 1 of 2015, going up to $913 million and now, $1.135 billion. In the first quarter, we don't have any tax payments, so it's always a little bit better and then the second quarter, you wind up sort of with a double tax payment and then normal in the third, fourth.","Our free cash flow in the quarter was $360 million, once again, just hardly any CapEx here. And we were able to reduce the debt in the first quarter by $370 million. So taking that down by $700 million, it'll be a very easy task for us. Our debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter using the definition that is in the data range, minus 3.7x, and that actually gives us plenty of cushion in terms of what we said. So we're ahead of schedule using their definitions. We've always said that cash is the best measure of performance, and I think that really be brought home throughout the year as you watch what happens to our balance sheet and our cash.","Next Slide. In terms of our asset-light business model, which has been a long journey for us. Finally this quarter for the first time, you'll see it's actually a negative working capital position. So as we grow now, we throw off cash instead of consuming cash, which is a rare business model that can get put into place. In the end of the first quarter, you can see every metric on this page was better than it has been previously. So inventory is down to 4.4% of sales and receivables were only 16%. So you look at that at 20.4%, but if you look at payables that are at 11.5% and then you look at deferred revenue skyrocketing to 11.8%, you got a negative 23.3% against the positive 20.4% and boom, there it is, a negative investment of 2.9%.","If you go back on that journey five years ago in the first quarter of 2012, our inventory was 7.5%, now it's 7.4%. Our receivables were 16.9% and now, they're 16%. Our payables were 11.2% and now they're 11.5%. And our deferred revenue was 3.3%. Today, it's 11.8%, and that has changed us from being 10% positive on working capital to a negative number of 2.9% and of course, the amount of cash that, that throws off for us and our ability to deploy the cash is unprecedented at any time in Roper's history. You can see the deferred revenue nominal number at the bottom in the last two years has increased from $237 million to $514 million. So if you want to look at just one metric about really the reinvention of the company, it's right here on this slide.","Next Slide. When we get into the segment detail, and I should have included this, the medical segment's at 72% gross margin, RF segment at 61% gross margin, industrial\u2019s at 51% and energy's at 57%, which leaves us with an enterprise gross margin above 62%.","Next Slide. So here, we start with energy systems, you'll see it had organic growth of 7%, and we had one business that was down, which we expected which is our Compressor Control business that will take a while longer to recover. If we excluded Compressor Controls, we actually were up organically 9% in the quarter in our Energy segment. Only oil and gas markets improved a bit. We wound up a sort of mid-single-digit growth. Terrific leverage in the business as you can see, the operating margins are up 380 basis points, operating profits up 25% on a revenue variance of plus 5.","Really basically an improved outlook for the balance of the year. We don't really see any net negative businesses for the rest of the year, may be a slight pullback in CCC. And then when you think about the mix in energy systems, it's about 1\/3 of that business is industrial and 2\/3 are energy. So even though the revenue's $125 million, it really represents a little over $80 million that's directly associated with energy.","So if we look at Industrial Technology, you can see here, that business was up by 8% organically. We had a little FX in there. And then you can see operating profit was up 15%, with revenue up 7%, so very strong leverage. OP margin up 190 basis points. Imagine that, an OP number of 29.2% for an industrial family of businesses. And inside that number, it's about 10% of that $183 million is really energy-related, so if you take the sort of $18 million for energy out of Industrial and the $80 plus million out of Energy, you wind up with about $100 million of total revenue that's energy related for the company. So it's around 8%, to maybe 8.5% of total enterprise revenue. And while it'll grow this year, you want to remember, it's a modest part of the enterprise.","So in Industrial, we had kind of a high single \u2013 mid-single digits, maybe low single-digit growth at Neptune and term in was low high-end cycle stuff 6%, 7%. Material analysis was up dramatically in the quarter, double-digit growth there; and our upstream oil and gas businesses were up double digit, with outstanding leverage. We actually don't see any of the businesses in Industrial being down for the balance of the year, so all that gives us a kind of positive performance.","And these things are sort of sorting themselves out to a situation where we probably think about 3 families within these 2 sectors of precision instruments, water businesses and energy businesses, and we'll talk more about that I think as the year goes forward.","Next slide. So the next segment we talk about is Medical & Scientific Imaging. Really, this is the health care technology family of businesses. If you look at the mix of these, you can see organic revenue is up 5% for the sector as a whole.","The Acute Care Software businesses, which include all of our connectivity business and laboratory businesses and the new genetic testing and workflow businesses with GeneInsight and Unit Connect as a family, internationally, we were up like 7%, sort of flat on the U.S. side and then up quite a bit on the diagnostic connectivity side and up substantially on decision technology business, though, which is Strata.","When you look at that business and then compare it to the \u2013 along with the alternate site healthcare business, it was up kind of mid-single digits as well. We had a decent quarter out of MHA's GPO business; and then SHP and SoftWriters continue to be very much faster growing than other components in the area. Those 2 businesses, the Acute Care Software, which is like a half a dozen units and the alternate site healthcare, which is really 3 units and sort of run more like 5, they represent half of the total revenue for this segment.","And then we have medical products, and that's about 35% of the segment's revenue. And the medical products, they were also up, everything sort of up mid-single digits when you add it together. But clearly, the big outperformer there is our Northern Digital business, which is moving into a number of activities that are beyond medical with the unique business that we have developed there, and that remains quite an exciting opportunity for us over the next several years.","Imaging was actually up in the quarter. Gatan's life science technology we're getting more and more adoption on the cryo-EM. And Imaging represents about 15% of the segment, if you're trying to understand what's going on here.","Operating margin was terrific at 34.4%, it's down 30 basis points only because we're continuing to invest at a fast clip in our genetic testing and workflow analysis. We have 2 revenue generators that won't be producing much profit for a little while longer in GeneInsight, Unit Connect, but they are very important pathways to the future for us around what we're achieving.","In the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, would be sort of similar to this quarter: broad-based medical growth, we think will continue, still at least at this sort of 5% level. Hopefully, we continue to get the market adoption of the new technologies with imaging. We don't see anything slowing that down. So overall for the segment, I think we'd wind up with this mid-single-digit organic growth.","Next slide. On RF Technologies, far and away the largest segment now, $451 million in revenue, up 60%, largely driven by ConstructConnect and Deltek joining the company here for the entire first quarter.","Organic revenue was 4%, a little bit of FX here. In terms of talking about the Deltek and ConstructConnect, we could sort of have a full individual slide on them.","Our governance model's in place and working well inside these businesses. We've had Mike Corkery who runs Deltek and Dave Conway who runs ConstructConnect out talking to some of our investors. People getting exposed to just how great those businesses are. As we spend more time with them together, they're finding more opportunities for working together to accelerate growth. And I think neither of the businesses independently thought might be there, so they seem to be quite encouraged about that.","Deltek's looking at a much larger GovCon opportunity as a result of the various things you see going at government these days, and they have a very large opportunity for adding paying customers to people that from time to time have subscribed to that software.","They also were very successful in launching their professional service that's first stage. We have a \u2013 sort of 3-stage of rollout and the first one was launched on time and is up and running.","When you look at the rest of the software businesses, that's a wide variety of things, from freight matching, to iTradeNet or CBORD, Horizon, On Center, Aderant legal software and the like. They were all up around mid-single digits as well, and they are, of course, incredible cash contributors.","On the toll and traffic side, it was kind of a bifurcated quarter, with the intelligent transportation systems side was up double digits. But most of that's driven by the Transsuite software platform we have and projects that we've talked about before, Riyadh and the New York area. Those don't carry much in the way of tax. And so we saw deterioration in tag revenue in the first quarter, which we actually had expected but nonetheless, it's a big negative. It was down 36% in the quarter, and it carries much higher margin. So where you look over here on the OP margin, and you can see it's 24.1%, the core being down 210 basis points was specifically Amtech tag shipments softness.","And we won't see that getting massively better throughout the year. It's still a very lumpy business with agency timings, and it'll be a very high-quality business. But we put the 2 together, we wound up with kind of low single-digit growth in the tolling activity.","For the balance of the year, you can see we think that software businesses continue to grow with strong margins and really, outstanding cash performance.","We think that the segment as a whole should be up 60%, but certainly, a lot of that, most of that is coming from Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions.","And overall, we'll get a kind of mid-single-digit organic growth out of the segment because the tag shipments are going to drag down the overall number. But we could get some infrastructure tolling, but we're not \u2013 we're holding our breath on whatever is going to happen with the government in that respect. But if you did get an infrastructure bill, it certainly could improve our outlook from being low single digits to a better number.","And then we thought it would be useful, you can see a pie chart here, to try to have everybody clearly understand the mix of what's going on in the segment now. So while we call it RF Technology and software, you'll see 65% of the revenue in the segment is coming from software. And that doesn't even count the toll and traffic software, which we just leave inside that because there's back-office software and there's Transsuite, so it would take it up to an even larger number.","The tolling thing is about 25% of revenue, but a portion of that is really Amtech RF products that go along with the other RF products that are buying, so Technolog and Amtech's Royale Business and Teletrance and things like that. So the product, physical products, are about 10% and tolling is around 25% and software is around 65% and, of course, growing.","Next slide. We get to guidance and I've got to turn the page here to Slide 14. So on the guidance, we're raising the full year guidance from $8.82 to $8.98 on the low-end and the high-end from $9.22 to $9.28, gives an $0.11 increase at the midpoint to $9.13.","Revenue, we've raised from 20% to 22% to 21% to 22% because we're raising organic from 3% to 5%, to 4% to 5%.","The cash flow, still looks to us like it's right at about $1.150 billion. That's around 24%, maybe even 25% of revenue, so just remains an astonishing performance. I do want to remind people that the $378 million in the first quarter is cash flow, it didn\u2019t have any tax payment in it and the tax is generally ran around $85 million a quarter, so you\u2019ll get that double hit in Q2 and the normalize tax in Q3 and Q4.","Our guidance for the second quarter, we said it will be $2.16 to $2.24. CapEx for the year is going to be sort of what generally is around 1.5% of revenue, may be it will be $65 million to $70 million, and that will include any capitalized software that's in the acquired businesses. Our tax rate is going to be somewhere around the 30% level. And may be it could be a little bit higher than that. That should probably be in the sort of 30%. I think there's not much more to say there. If you guys all know what the interest costs are for the balance of the year, and so you can kind see how that operating cash flow will go by quarter that reached $1.150 billion or more at the end of the year.","Next slide. So we look at the Q1 summary. Certainly, we had record results across everything that matters, a very broad organic growth across all four segments, nothing really holding us back anymore. We've got DEPS up 17% to $2.11; EBITDA, up 15% to $362 million. We reduced the debt by $370 million in the quarter so we got really a rapid strengthening of the balance sheet, which we expected, and we still have $650 million or more outside the U.S. and so we're kind of waiting to see just what happens on repatriation, and that will be very a dramatic benefit for us. And ConstructConnect and Deltek are really performing very well and the opportunities in these businesses is very much what we thought it was, probably more.","Next slide. If you look sort of strategically about the quarter, you can see now how we're really benefiting from what we did in 2015 and 2016. So instead of hunkering down at the time of economic challenge. We really took the time to reinvent ourselves for the second time. First time we did this was back in 2003 and 2004 when we acquired Neptune and TransCore. And really, the second time around with the acquisition of ConstructConnect and Deltek is going to give us the same kind of positive results but with even better cash compounding along the way.","Over half of the EBITDA in the enterprise now comes from software and from network businesses, and that doesn't count any of the software contributions we get out of TransCore's back office of Transsuite business or from Compressor Controls' software; even higher if we added those in. The deferred revenue is increasing our ability to compound cash. We now have over $0.5 billion of deferred revenue, and it's always good to use other people's money.","Net working capital is now in negative territory, so we get to generate cash as we grow instead of having to have been consumed by the growth in things that show up in working capital.","Our cash return on investment has been rapidly improving. The typical multi-industry guys are probably running somewhere between 20%, to 40%, 45%. We're going to be running over 200% by the end of the year. And you'll hear more about that as the year goes on.","We have newly elected officers that all take their positions on May 15. So we have two Executive Vice Presidents, Neil Hunn and Paul Soni. Neil is getting close to his sixth year with the company. He's now an elected officer effective May 15. His responsibilities include pretty much all of the Medical segment with the exception of Imaging and most of the new software acquisitions, so a very broad piece of the portfolio. Paul Soni is leaving his role as Principal Accounting Officer, which he's been here for over a decade with me doing that to take on a series of executive leadership roles, most of which will be announced a little later. It'll involve some of our specific businesses and a wide variety of the senior process, things that need to happen here.","Bob Crisci, as you know, has been our Inventor Relations and financial planning person, will be taking over as Chief Financial Officer in a couple of weeks and certainly, been acting like that for a couple of months. And Jason Conley, who used to be our Investor Relations person, you'd remember and financial analysis guy, went out to MHA to be their CFO and then as we acquired the software companies to expand MHA with SoftWriters and SHP, Jason was the person driving the integration and supporting the coaching of bringing those new organizations inside and he's returning back to the Sarasota headquarters from New Jersey. No taxes for Jason. And he'll be starting May 15 as our Principal Accounting Officer, which gives us a really fantastic team of well-educated and passionate and tireless people.","All these appointments came from within Roper, which we're very proud of. And it really speaks volumes to the depth of the organization, talent we have and the strength of our leadership development process. Every one of these people has had multiyear plans in place for different exposures to different roles and different types of business, all of which supports our succession planning and positions us to have a leadership team that's very, very connected to the continuing execution of our strategy.","And with that, I think we can open up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go for to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Brian Jellison","Hey good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","I just want to start off with a congratulations to John on his retirement announcement, and I do remember when John joined as the rookie CFO, and you've come a long way and congrats and enjoy your retirement.","John Humphrey","Thank you Deane. I appreciate that.","Deane Dray","And just maybe to start off and, Brian, I know you sized the energy piece, but it was such a headwind for the company for the past year, and it's nice seeing that snapback. Maybe give us some color on how you expect to see these, especially the upstream businesses, come back here and maybe touch on Roper Pumps. I know it's a small piece, but it really was a ground zero with the fall off in fracking and you've built new capacity in Houston. And what's your expectations on the recovery there?","Brian Jellison","Well, it was up double digits in the quarter on the revenue side and up like 40% on the profit, maybe a little more, very high leverage. Orders continue to be pretty strong for that business. One of the reasons we had everybody together in all the product businesses last week was to sort of make sure we're ahead of what's going to happen for the balance of the year and next year and beyond, make sure we're smart about looking at \u2013 we kind of look at the whole product family as being responsive to the customers pulling stuff other than us pushing stuff to them.","So we're kind of big process review, talking about cost push inflation, capacity utilization, risk of supplier interruptions, material cost escalations, and those kinds of things. I think that the broker enjoys a unique position if you got an expansion of fracking. And they could be up sharply. But you're right that they were off so much. We tried a couple of years ago to articulate the mix between upstream, midstream and downstream by taking apart a wide variety of businesses when we kind of. But it's almost better to just say here's the six or seven businesses that are primarily in that area.","Roper Pump gets reported in industrial and really is an energy asset. I mean it could be up 40% this year, but it's very nice incrementally, but it's not \u2013 won't be overly meaningful. I mean, that's a business that used to be $100 million, it went down to $40 million. And it was up 30%, it will be a $52 million business so half of what it was in 2014 but a dramatic improvement.","Deane Dray","Certainly, and I'd rather be in a position explaining the nature of the snapback than where we were a year ago. Just switching over to Deltek and ConstructConnect. Brian, you alluded to some potential upside versus what you had initially discussed at the time of the acquisitions; pointing to the government opportunity, adding subscribers and professional services. Can you expand on that and how you expect to see those opportunities develop and maybe quantify what the upside might be?","Brian Jellison","Yes. I think the quantification would be more in terms of forward growth rates, so maybe mid-single digits and high single digits. I'll ask Neil to talk a little bit about what they see in terms of professional services with these new launches of products and a little bit around the GovCon opportunity.","Neil Hunn","Sure, Deane. So let's do Deltek first. What we've been talking with the team there and doing our reviews this quarter, Mike Corkery said, and he's a pretty conservative guy, former CFO of the enterprise, that almost an unprecedented level of activity around building the sales pipeline in the low to mid-market side of government contracting. And so fortunately, we're well positioned there on the ERP side of GovCon work. But it is just that. It's building funnel.","The funnel's got to mature. It's got to convert. It's got to get implemented before it becomes sort of well into to our financials. So it's a good position to be, and I'm certain the end-market reasons for that are obvious around Trump and infrastructure and all that. I think the subcontractor universe is getting ready for that. Relative to the product development, it's really a machine in terms of what Namita does with her team there.","There's ordinary run rate development work that they do and when we bought the business, there was an internal project that had 3 phases that was above and beyond that and the first deliverable of that, Deltek for professional services, was released in the quarter on time, on schedule, on budget, but it's just it's a new category.","We're a challenger in the category, and it'll be sort of what we expect that to be a slow build over a long period of time in terms of building that business for us but we have the product now to attack that market. So we're very encouraged about \u2013 we've only been with the business now for 3 or 4 months, but it's very encouraging to start. On \u2013 and that's the summary on Deltek.","Brian Jellison","Okay, that's good. So maybe we're going to think we've got another 1 point, or 1.5 points, 2 points of organic down the road of what we thought when we bought it.","Operator","The next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert McCarthy","Congratulations on a solid quarter; great growth. You've heard the song remains the same. And I guess, you're not a one-man band anymore, Brian, right? Given all these...","Brian Jellison","I am at this moment in time, Robert. The people just \u2013 some people don't believe it.","Robert McCarthy","But I guess, since we're on the topic and, obviously, we've had a succession. And again, I will echo the comments of Deane; congratulations, John, on a wonderful career. And, Rob, best wishes going forward. Have you \u2013 is there anything you can share about the Chairman, CEO succession planning from your standpoint? And that doesn't mean you have to share with me your Fitbit of your cholesterol or your vitals, so...","Brian Jellison","Well, I'm happy to do that if I were [indiscernible]. So actually, I'm not concerned about the succession at all. I think it's wonderful. I'm not a modest owner of the stock, so I've never sold a share of stock in my life since I arrived here, so it's finally accumulated to a meaningful number. I had to get rid of options because they expire in 10 years and so as that would take the crap out of me, but anyway, it is what it is. The opportunity for us adding capital value to the enterprise is the best it's ever been in our history. The company is going kind of through its second phase of reinvention. We had a marvelous run after Neptune and TransCore.","And now, we're going to have the same situation again. The things that we can deploy capital to acquire are phenomenal opportunities, much better than what we were limited to, say, 10 years ago. So all that feel is really good. I think you can see from all of the new executive moves are from internal people. I think the board and myself, would be extremely disappointed if we didn't have an internal successor, but virtually everybody was here. We went outside a year ago to bring in a General Counsel because we wanted some specific knowledge about business acuity that we thought needed to come from an outside source. But other than that, I don't see why we would need to bring outside people, but we very much value the culture and the connectivity of everything we do. On our values page, the number 1 thing we have up there is we believe that cash return on investment drives shareholder value.","And we're not too interested in somebody coming in with a different paradigm that thinks that businesses trade on some other foundation because they do not. They trade on cash return. It's an ingrained principle. It's \u2013 every part of our governance process is really characterized around that. When we had our strategic meeting with our product people last week, and we showed them everything that had happened numerically from 2011 by year through 2016 and what their vitality index of strategies looked like through 2019. I just don't think people do that.","And we do that in spades, and we do it with numbers, so that people can go away from here and execute. So those are strong reasons why the board would be very much interested in assuring that we have put in place all the leadership succession processes that we need to have everybody immediately available to take over all the roles.","Robert McCarthy","And as a follow-up, which I think is related, obviously, you go to Slide 8, and you see what's going on there in terms of the asset-light business model on working capital. And then you start to think about the broad-based recovery on the macro side, the strength you're seeing in recovering energy markets. It's probably a good time for valuations from a standpoint of exiting assets and also potentially contemplating separation, particularly in the context of your kind of thoughts around the second phase of the company.","Could you talk about kind of the puts and takes around potential separation or how you're thinking about perhaps divesting some assets to basically refine or \u2013 refine the overall portfolio?","Brian Jellison","Well, it really hasn't changed at all. You have the same forces of work. So you have the product nature of the company, the old energy and the industrial base businesses have very low tax bases. So as long as it's a 35%-plus leakage on whatever you get, people would have to pay a huge premium for us to get a net yield that was re-investable at the kind of rate we'd like to have.","So we think the market reasonably understands what the portfolio looks like. There's certainly people have been \u2013 have approached us throughout the last couple of years with various reverse Morris trust concepts around some portions of the portfolio. We've talked about that sort of openly and the challenge is that people that approach us are guys that have 38% gross margins and 18% EBITDA. And you look at these businesses that have gross margins of 51% and 57%, and EBITDA margins at 30%, they marvel at them, and they can't figure out where are their synergies.","Now the reason they can't is there aren't any. It would be \u2013 you need to acquire them and drive them on a CRI perspective, and we're not doing that. So our rate of reinvestment will continue to be driven around the kind of asset-light businesses and cash returns that you get out of the software businesses that we've been acquiring. So those core product businesses simply are going to grow at a faster organic rate for a couple of years. They'll throw off more cash. That gives us an opportunity to invest that in very high return and slightly better growth businesses. So I don't think anything's changed in that respect.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Joe Giordano from Cowen and Company.","Joe Giordano","I wanted to just talk about Deltek and ConstructConnect. Is there any sort of \u2013 how can those businesses work together? Is there any sort of like go-to-market strategy to leverage the 2 offerings to the customers, in particular, or is there \u2013 are they kind of \u2013 I know they're independent, but is there a way to kind of leverage that together?","Brian Jellison","Well, with \u2013 the nature of the word and whether it's a verb or not is important. So we wouldn't force leverage putting 2 world-class businesses that developed independently together. But we're more than happy to facilitate the opportunity for the 2 businesses to look at how they can use each other customers to basically drive access to channel a customer that they wouldn't have if they weren't owned by the same company. Deltek and ConstructConnect each have massive goodwill in terms of how customers feel about them. So it is infinitely easier for a Deltek contact to a ConstructConnect customer knowing that it's part of that family. The receptivity is higher and the same thing is true, so sharing that customer opportunity is a big deal.","And we allow cooperation and then kind of let the businesses \u2013 really, Corkery and Conway, they're CEOs of their businesses. And that's true of all these large businesses, with Hawkins the CEO of Acute Care and Sicilian's the CEO of Alternate Site. So we'll let Neil maybe tell you about how these early meetings have been so fruitful.","Neil Hunn","Yes. So we'll break it down both on the channel and on the product. On channel side, remember that Deltek is very \u2013 it's 40% market share globally in architecture and engineering as a vertical for professional services. They're a challenger in construction in the AC space and ConstructConnect lives in the construction space. ConstructConnect has 41,000 paying subcontractors and 850,000 subcontractors in their network. And so you can immediately see the opportunity to work together around regeneration on the product and \u2013 on the go-to-market strategy.","On the product side, the core part of what ConstructConnect does is aggregate content and data that allows all the various building product manufacturers, GCs and subs, to know what projects are in the funnel. Deltek has a similar but different product that allows government contractors to know what sort of government contracting work's in the bid pipeline. So there's opportunity to sort of enrichen the data of \u2013 between both businesses and sharing content.","So it's very much a tandem strategy, but it's being led organically by the 2 leaders of the business. It happened \u2013 they knew each other a little bit before when they became part of the fold within the same quarter. They immediately reached to out to each other. These meetings are occurring without intervention from the team here in Sarasota.","Joe Giordano","That's great color there. I appreciate that. If you guys were to look at the businesses that are snapping back here a little bit after definitely easier comps because that's part of it, but if you were to maybe try to strip out seasonality and look at it on a sequential basis going forward looking at your order patterns, how do you see that? Was it \u2013 do you look at it more of a step-up to just a higher run rate, or is it kind of \u2013 are you seeing month-on-month continued kind of acceleration on a sequential basis more than on a year-on-year basis?","Brian Jellison","Well, these things generally will have a stronger second quarter and fourth quarter on a seasonality basis. But when you're bouncing back from a situation that's artificially low, you could get sequential improvement all the time. We certainly will have sequential improvement second quarter over the first. So Rob, you may want to...","Robert Crisci","Yes, I think there is sequential improvement. The run rates with the Roper Pump and any of the upstream businesses, they're certainly up and that should continue throughout the year. And then, on a year-over-year basis, right, we're talking about mid-single-digit growth for each of the Industrial and Energy segment, than when we talked to you 3 months ago, we were looking more like low single digit.","Joe Giordano","Right, right, right. Just one last like nitpick on the guys just to get a sense of where you're looking. So the full year guide, up less than the magnitude of beating 1Q. Is there just \u2013 should we think about that as a bit of conservatism or you're kind of maybe factoring in some of this happening already and it's less of a surprise? How would you reconcile those things?","Brian Jellison","No, I think we just think that moving up from 3% organic to 4% is a 33% increase, right? So 4% to 5% organic is pretty strong for the enterprise. I think we'll have the one organic headwind for the year is going to be that portion of toll and traffic that's related to tags is going to be off, and it could be off $20 million at least this year unless there's some resurgence in new tolling activity, which there could well be because our bid process is off the charts.","So there's lots of activity, but right now, we're relying on the base, and we'll have to see. But I don't think it's conservatism. But I think you've got to remember how small this whole thing is. If you look at all of that Industrial and Energy, you're looking at something that's about 25% or 28%. So if you've got something, it would have to be up quite substantially more than the kind of 4% mid-single digits we're talking about it for it be very material, so...","Robert Crisci","Yes, I'd just add to that. For the first quarter, the Medical and RF segments were right where we expected them to be and the outlook there for the rest of the year is just as we had it coming in for the year. So really, the only change is better environment in Industrial and Energy and rolling that forward for the year. And as Brian pointed out, that's a smaller percentage of the company than it used to be.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So I guess my first question, with clearly great cash generation this quarter, I guess, Brian, as I kind of think about your cash profile moving forward, I'm trying to just maybe understand how I should think about that deferred revenue number as a percentage of sales clearly getting close to 12% this quarter. How do you think about that on a more normalized basis? And how do you think about like trade working capital on a more normalized basis?","Brian Jellison","It's normalized right now at negative 2.9%. There's nothing cyclical about that. We get more and more deferred revenue, it becomes a positive thing, right. So the more you grow, if you're paying in advance for what you do, the more deferred revenue you get. So welcome to probably the first negative working capital company in your coverage.","Joe Ritchie","That is \u2013 you guys would be the first negative working capital company in my coverage. I guess, the \u2013 at least at this stage of the cycle. Okay, that's helpful. I guess, my second question, and it relates to this, is if you think about your leverage, you're now down to 3.7, I think that in the conversations that we had last quarter, I think kind of a goal this year was to kind of get into like the mid-3s. It seems like you're definitely accelerating beyond that. Can you get below 3? Is the goal now to get below 3x net leverage at the end of the year?","Brian Jellison","No, I think we don't have any goal. We have certain covenants and certain requirements, and we can't exceed 4 without mentioning it to people. And we expect to get down easily to meet all of our commitments and our covenants. So it's much more likely we would run routinely at 3x debt-to-EBITDA than we would run routinely at 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. And if we didn't do other acquisitions, I wouldn't borrow that. That's we wouldn't do this year. We'd certainly be down to levels like \u2013 and you can see we're going to have $1 billion of free cash flow. Other than increasing our dividend for the 25th time and become a dividend aristocrat, I don't think you'll see us have another deployment unless it's an acquisition.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. And if I could maybe sneak in one more, and I know it's a smaller piece of your business today, but both Industrial and the Energy pieces of your business saw incredibly good incremental margins this quarter. And I know that you guys have kind of growth rates staying mid-single digits. So should we be expecting like pretty elevated incremental margins then throughout the rest of the year in both those businesses?","Robert Crisci","Yes, I think for those 2 segments, as you grow, we would expect really strong leverage, similar to what you saw in the first quarter because of where they are after the cost reductions over the past couple of years. On the way back up, we would expect pretty strong leverage.","Operator","We'll now move to our next question, and that will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","John, congratulations, again.","John Humphrey","Thanks.","Steve Tusa","So I didn't see the orders in the presentation. What were organic orders up in the quarter?","Brian Jellison","I don't know. All the data's in there. Book to bill is 1.01\u2026","Robert Crisci","Organic orders for the company, plus 3.","Brian Jellison","Yes.","Steve Tusa","Plus 3?","Robert Crisci","And Industrial and Energy is where we \u2013 is where the orders number really matters and it was up 1.06 in Industrial and 1.01 in Energy. It's a less useful metric.","Brian Jellison","Book-to-bill.","Robert Crisci","Yes, book-to-bill. It's a less useful metric for the Medical and RF side.","Steve Tusa","Right, okay, okay, but up 3 in orders, that's great. And then, is it normal for you guys to \u2013 kind of going back to McCarthy's question, is it normal for you guys to have, like, 2 specific segments for one of these kind of enterprise meetings? I mean I'm just \u2013 I've never heard of a company that says let's invite these 2 specific segments for kind of that type of company-wide meeting. I mean, have you guys done that before? Have you done that with other segments where you just kind of like cherry pick a couple of the segments out of the portfolio to meet together?","Brian Jellison","No, no, we bring together people together that have great connectivity. So all of our Energy and Industrial people have similar kinds of challenges that we monitor and provide guidance to and measure. We have a separate strategic planning session with our medical companies. That was conducted in December when they're all together in the same place for a week. So we do those things in logical ways. There's no sense bringing a company together that's writing code for software with a pump manufacturer.","Steve Tusa","Right, right. It's kind of like industrial analysts covering a software company. That was a joke. So is this kind of a precursor to maybe collapsing the reporting on those 2 segments?","Brian Jellison","No, I don't \u2013 I wouldn't do read much in to those things. I think what would you see is for a couple years, I said we \u2013 it would be helpful for us, and we're trying to do that in this quarter again, to get really good clarity around. So how much energy exposure do you have in Energy and Industrial because they're not really clean segments. The Energy segment is about 2\/3 energy and 1\/3 industrial; and the Industrial segment's like 10% to 12% energy and 88% industrial. And so that's our fault, and it confuses people and we'll try to make that \u2013 I think we've made it quite clear this morning, but you'll continue to see clarity come in that area.","Operator","And now we'll hear from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy","My congratulations to everybody on the promotions. Just one question for me. Broadly speaking, can you talk across the platform on the hardware businesses, price and volume trends? And then on the software businesses, sub-ads or retention rates.","Brian Jellison","One of the great things about the company is we don't really have any standard products. There are just a few areas like residential, water meters, that they don't have the intelligent controls on them. So we're all an application company. It's very difficult for somebody to say what's the price yield because you don't have a SKU that you're following, and you can look at the SKU by channel. So you can always best measure it by looking at the gross margin in the enterprise, right. So pricing power comes from the quality of the product or service or technology you're applying and our gross margins continue to go up all the time.","And so that is a pretty effective productivity measurement of whether or not you're getting the pricing opportunity that's available. You won't find Roper unilaterally raising prices like perhaps some private equity group might do for a short-term gain. We're going to have our pricing match the reality of sort of free market that we operate in over a long period of time. So as a rule, I would say we got some modest pricing in everything we do versus the prior year.","Operator","And that will end our question-and-answer session. We'll return back to Robert Crisci for closing remarks.","Robert Crisci","Excellent. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you in 3 more months.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your call for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"18893":["Roper Industries, Inc.

The Roper Industries Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. This call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Kayla, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our record third quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Rob Crisci, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. Our press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com.","Next slide, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Now if you'll please turn to slide three, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation and on our website.","For the third quarter the difference between GAAP and adjusted results consists of two discrete items. First, a purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and SHP and that totals about $950,000. That's an adjustment to both revenue and operating profit. As a reminder this represents revenue that absent our acquisition those businesses would have recognized. In addition we also had an inventory related step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000.","And now if you'll please turn the slide, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Good morning, everyone. If we look at this first slide here on a summary to the third quarter. At the enterprise level we had record third quarter results in all of the categories. All time record on orders and backlog, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA.","One of the things that was particularly encouraging about the quarter as we've really didn't have any significant headwinds in any one of our segments. I remember last year we had difficulty with Zetec and from time to time there may be something. This quarter around we really didn't have anything at the segment level. We did have better geographic results on a broader base than we would have expected while the US was certainly up. Every place was up except for Brazil and some portions of the Middle East.","Our revenue in total was up 6% with organic revenue up 4% and again, kind of broad based results, all of the segments were up. Our gross margin was up 70 basis points on the adjusted non-GAAP number to 59.4%, a little better on a GAAP basis and operating margin was up 60 basis points to 27.9%. Leverage in the quarter was 39% in keeping with our guidance of 35% or more.","Net earnings were up 10% to $156 million represented $1.55. Of course the GAAP basis compared to the prior year was higher than that of 13%. Our operating cash flow was $226 million, which was a cash conversion of cash to net earnings of 145%. So it was a terrific quarter for us pretty much across the board and certainly provides a lot more assurance about us reporting our record 2014 full year.","Next slide. If we look at the income statement in the quarter, orders were up 6% to $893 million. Revenue was up 6% while organic was up 4%, it will be up stronger than that in the fourth quarter.","Our gross margins were up to 59.4% as we set up 70 basis points, operating income up. Our earnings before tax were up 12% to $228 million. Our tax rate was higher in the quarter from last year instead of 30.3% it was 31.3% which cost us $0.02 a share. And then you can see the net earnings number at the bottom, the diluted earnings per share and we're comparing it against our non-GAAP number last year of about 42 on a GAAP basis, we were at $1.54 against $1.36 last year. ","Next slide. EBITDA growth continues and our margin expansion continues. I know most people find that really remarkable, but we do have certainly some of the best operating people in the world and they continue to deliver spectacular results.","In the last two years, our EBITDA is up $301 million to $1.173 billion from $872 million and our EBITDA margins have grown by 380 basis points they were 29.8% in 2012 and people telling me they would obviously max out and the direction of the mean would be taking us down to the mid 20s. Nothing could be further from the truth. We continue to grow our margins. You can see they were up to 33.6% and our gross margins similarly have expanded back in 2012 on a trailing 12 month basis at this point in the year, our gross margins were 55.2% and today our trailing 12 month gross margins are 59.3%.","Next slide. If we look at the cash flow, we had better cash flow quarter here in Q3 as you can see, the important items being 145% cash conversion on operating cash flow. That $226 million represented 25.6% of revenue in the quarter and our free cash flow at $217 million represented 24.5% of free cash flow to revenue in the quarter. That brings us as you can see to $579 million on the year we would expect a strong fourth quarter so that our conversion factors stay well above the 130%.","If we look at the compounding nature of cash flow which is what we get out of all of these software and medical acquisitions we've taken cash flow up from $659 million in the trailing 12 months in 2012 to $815 million this year and of course we'll have a stronger fourth quarter. It will be the 17th year in a row that our cash flow \u2013 free cash flow will exceed net earnings.","Next slide. Here, if we look at the balance sheet you'll see cash grew in the quarter by $104 million. Our undrawn revolver was paid down. So despite deploying $303 million in the quarter for acquisitions, we ended the quarter with almost $2 billion in cash and undrawn revolver position, with our trailing 12 month EBITDA at $1.173 billion you can see those ratios gross debt-to-EBITDA at 2, we'd like to be higher than that. We would expect that we would easily deploy $1 billion or more in the acquisition arena in the next 12 months and it could be higher than that could reach a $1.5 billion.","Next slide. Here if we look at the individual segments, they all performed well in the quarter. Next slide. The energy systems and controls we'll start with the smallest of the segments. You can see here that energy systems & controls represents about 17% of the EBITDA we get in quarter three. Its revenue was up sharply up 10% over the prior year. Operating profit was up 19%. So it had very, very outstanding leverage, only 50% leverage in the quarter. OP margin reached 28.7 and the good thing about all of that is within the fourth quarter we expect a very strong improvement in operating margins out of our energy systems segment.","Orders were up terrifically, they were up over 14% in the quarter for energy. The organic revenue in the quarter you can see here was 8% with that terrific leverage. We had double-digit growth in our oil & gas products including the safety systems that are involved in fracking operations.","The valves and sensor businesses were good. We saw absolutely no softness in anything related to fracking activity or oil sands activity where we do a lot of dewatering of pump businesses that you'll see coming up when we talk about industrial. Here it's really the shut off valves that are important.","Our Zetec business bounced back from a bad third quarter a year ago to have a much more normal quarter, so much, much improved on an easy comp basis and on the aftermarket and field service for compressor controls was particularly strong, although the large project spending decisions certainly have been slow with all the geopolitical confusion you have. But despite those geopolitical issues compressor controls bookings in the quarter were up nearly 20%. We had a modest decline in our PAC business around refinery instrumentation projects, but nothing to be alarmed about.","In the fourth quarter our oil & gas products continue to perform well as this oil price indicator doesn't seem to have any elasticity effect on our businesses. Again, we're much more involved in the throughput productivity side of that than in the exploration of new well side.","Very strong compressor controls aftermarket and field service would be expected in the fourth quarter and this is a segment that always has strong fourth quarter results for people that have left over MRR budgets and we would think that would be the same this year. Often that benefits our instrument sales and despite having some foreign exchange headwinds which occurred in September and will of course continue in the fourth quarter, we still see very strong sequential operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.","Next slide. Here if we look at industrial technology, you can see industrial technology is up to 21% of the companies EBITDA in the quarter. It had modest revenue growth, but last year was particularly with Neptune an all-time record third quarter number, operating profit up modestly with the margin was up 200 basis points going forward from the way we look at it, it will be a much stronger margin.","The Roper Pumps Directional Drilling activity continued to be just really very, very good double-digit growth. The relined activity we do in the new Houston facility that we opened last year is continuing to ramp up passing its breakeven contribution and doing extremely well now and it's going to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter.","Our Cornell Pump business which is the dewatering business continues to do very well. The rental markets are up strongly and the shale and oil gas production area even though rig counts may be modest or declining in some areas it doesn't matter for us because the productivity increases that you're seeing many of these places are up 20% productivity. Our products are really required for the throughput side of the equation, so they are not influenced that much by the new rig count and much more by the throughput.","Our Material Analysis business has performed well and did better in Europe than we would have expected. In fact, the overall company did better in Europe than we might have feared given the headlines you see.","Neptune was down slightly in the quarter against last year\u2019s all-time record performance, still performed very well. The five year Toronto project is a bit ahead of schedule and as we looked and talked with them we think that's probably on track to get completed some time next year, perhaps around the end of the first half of the year and we continue to develop and expand our systems capability at Neptune.","And one of the great things that the technology team has done there is backward compatibility for all these enhanced systems and the result of that is that people don't have to worry about a technology migration because we're really offer them an evolution that allows them to be able to use old and new technology at the same time and we're not limited by any old networks that so many of our competitors are strangled with.","In the fourth quarter, we have mid single digit revenue growth that we think we'll have within the segment as a whole, despite having foreign exchange headwinds that we have to overcome. We expect to have particular strengthen the stores [ph] Material Analysis segment and Roper Pump is going to continue to gain as their production continues to improve quickly, and we think we'll have stronger operating margins in the fourth quarter along with much stronger revenue growth.","Next slide. If we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment, it had substantial order growth in our Toll & Traffic businesses. Last quarter, we talked to you about very important wins in the Henry Hudson Bridge in the San Francisco Bay Area projects and this quarter we've added to those with the Houston Grand Parkway and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Upgrades and Florida I-95 Express Lanes, all three of those will be in excess of $50 million in total. So all that bodes well for the future in 2015.","We had increased Tag Shipments that helped our margins. You can see the margins were up 80 basis points to 29.1% really led by improvements in the Tag Shipment business. Our SaaS businesses continued to grow, but the important thing about them is even though they may only have mid single digit growth, they compound that cash flow growth on a constant basis that allows us a lot of money to reinvestment as they need very little for their own internal business development.","And our CBORD & Horizon business had strong operating profit as recurring and maintenance revenue grew despite having lower revenue in the fewer security projects that you're seeing at the university and K-12 [ph] level.","If we look to the fourth quarter, you can see that we think we'll have kind of low single digit growth compared to last years record fourth quarter, but still better than last year. We've got substantial opportunities in growth in the Intelligent Transportation Systems solution area. We've got quite a lot of bids out. We've got some significant progress we've been making on process quotes and discussions that look like it should well position us for certainly 2015.","The iTrade business has been benefited by the FoodLink acquisition that we did towards the \u2013 in the third quarter. Normally, our integration process is pretty simple and the iTrade area that was an opportunity to take some cost out and to do some other thing which is are several months ahead of schedule. So we feel particularly good about how that's performing and as you can see, the Radio Frequency segment in the quarter represents a 26% of our total EBITDA.","Next slide. Here as we look at our largest segment, the Medical segment, which increasingly really is around healthcare. If we look at organic growth we were up 6% in the quarter. The device side of the business was sort of low single digit growth led really by our Northern Digital as mentioned image-guided products and some consumables at CIVCO.","We had great performance, just great performance in both Sunquest and MHA. Sunquest continues to drive execution around the meaningful use implementations and upgrade which is finally getting us out at some of the backlog that we had experienced last year with Sunquest. So productivity is up sharply here.","And at MHA, we've got a favorable trend in basically the spending arena around long-term care pharmacies and assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. So MHA is having of course is \u2013 really both Sunquest and MHA have spectacular all time record years.","We acquired Strategic Healthcare, SHP in the quarter. It's really a phenomenal business with high growth profile. It's a SaaS provider of data analytics for the post-acute healthcare organizations. These are things like home health and hospice care. It's very complimentary to what we do at MHA.","And we also acquired another company, IPA Innovative Products which is the leading provider of automated surgical scrub dispensing systems for hospitals. Pretty good timeline given everything people worry about today on disease protection and they provide a lot of productivity for the surgical suite because people oftentimes can't find their uniforms, they don't have the right size, people have to wait while people bring it and these automated dispensing criteria is just facilitate that and reduce expenses almost immediately for the hospital.","If we look at the fourth quarter, we've got Sunquest and MHA will continue their double-digit growth and medical devises probably going to be in the mid single digit arena, but the overall segment even with the imaging activity is expected to have double-digit segment growth in the fourth quarter.","So not only do we get that, we think we'll continue to have some margin expansion and you can see that medical healthcare was up 36% or not up 36% but represented 36% of the company's EBITDA.","Next slide. So if we update the guidance \u2013 next slide, we're increasing our full year guidance from $6.27 to $6.37 to $6.32 to $6.38. We started out the year with $6.05, so we're quite pleased with how the year has come on line.","Our full year guidance would be to have revenue growth around 8% to 9% with organic growth around 6% to 7%. We're going to bounce back here with organic growth in the fourth quarter at 6% to 7%. Overall revenue growth in the fourth quarter expected to be 7% to8%, fortunately taxes probably going to be 32%.","And then these guidance numbers include the September 30th foreign exchange rates. They don't forecast anything beyond that. Exchange hurt us a bit as in September but didn't do much for the quarter as a whole but it's a bit of a drag going into Q4.","Next slide. Here if we look at the summary of the quarter, once again we achieved records in pretty much every category you can think of. The revenue up 6% with organic 4%, but we're going to have a stronger 6% to 7% Q4 organic in the fourth quarter.","Gross margins at 59.4% are pretty spectacular. Operating margins at 27.9%, but the reality is we have a lot of non-cash and tangible amortization and if you look at the EBITDA performance you'll see it's even stronger. We got 39% operating leverage out of the third quarter which is quite remarkable and EBITDA almost at a $300 million clip at a third of the revenue.","We deployed $300 million in attractive acquisitions. We expect to continue the capital deployment. We've got a favorable pipeline and there are quite a few things that we're working diligently on as we speak. I don't know if any of those would close within the quarter, but they are likely to close some time sooner rather than later.","We've got very good year-to-date performance through the first nine months' certainly record levels of growth and record margins and cash flow. We've raised our full year guidance again and we're confirming the strong cash conversion that we talked about well above 130%. We expect a record year. And with that, we should open it up to questions, John.","John Humphrey","","Okay. Kayla, so if you can start the Q&A portion of our call this morning we'd appreciate that.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird.","Yes, good morning, Brian, John, and Rob.","John Humphrey","Good morning.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Just for starters, could we just maybe talk a little bit to Brian about the geographic growth. You kind of touched on it in the materials analysis business. But just kind of suggested that maybe overall Europe was stronger than expected. Just maybe kind of comment on maybe what businesses in Europe surprised you positively?","Brian Jellison","Well, we had pretty deep growth everywhere in the quarter. I mean, nothing spectacular, but the only places we were down was Brazil where we expected to be and some of the things in the Middle East which are really slow just because of the political environment and decision making, but our positions are good and solid.","Everywhere else grew. So Asia was up double-digits, Europe was up 3%, Canada despite some last minute currency pressure was still up in the low single digits and the US was up a little over 5%. So you know about 65% of revenue is still domestic if you will and about 35% outside North America used to be closer to 40, but as Sunquest and MHA are essentially US businesses. So that affects the thing.","But the core underlying businesses are doing well globally, really other than Japan don't have any softness anywhere in Asia. Europe's industrial activity was where we were kind of pleasantly surprised. We did particularly well in Germany and given the things that you're seeing about Germany that was \u2013 and we felt good about that and orders were strong there, and then medical did particularly well in Europe against its normal outcome.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And just from the M&A pipeline, in the M&A pipeline, what \u2013 are you seeing a lot of opportunities that are non-medical, the scientific?","Brian Jellison","Well, we see a lot and pursue a lot of things that are SaaS based or licensed software that we look at and those fall into very different categories. I mean, one of the things we're doing now would look more like an extension of Inovonics, which is our security business that has some very unique technology of the pendants if you look at the product fall and can't get our pendant lines of activities that we have that we don't talk a lot about. So there are sometimes things in that arena that we look at.","In the industrial arena, we still really haven't seen anything that would fit our cash return on investment methodology. We're getting very strong GAAP based EPS performance out of fluid handling and when we look at other people stuff we just don't see people that have our margins.","Our EBITDA margins in that segment are above 30% and most of the stuff we see comes in with gross margins at 30 and EBITDA margins at 16 and it depends on other people increasing demand to create any real leverage in the business.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","I see. Okay, very good. Well, thank you and congrats. Nice quarter.","Brian Jellison","Thank you. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","","Thanks, good morning.","","Brian Jellison","","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","","As we look into next year, it seems like you have some nice momentum carrying through with tolling projects and the medical SaaS businesses, then there's some concern of the oil & gas markets idea, that spending might be hitting a plateau. You gave some color Brian, but maybe you could just give a deeper diagnosis of that market?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, I think the thing that was encouraging about the third quarter was CCC was basically up 20% in orders and that's an area that you would be concerned about two factors. One, geopolitical risk with Russian sanctions and anybody serving anything going into those markets and then price elasticity around Brent and WTI crude or are you worried then about rig counts being less growth even than they were.","Well, it turns out you know, all of our stuff is productivity related and so it's aftermarket activity or it's improving throughput. We had a very strong Cornell pump business growth with dewatering pumps. Well, if your productivity and if you read almost anything you'll see that things like Eagle Ford, their productivity is up 20%. Well that measures throughput and they need our dewatering activity for that throughput increase. So it's less dependent on new rig counts and more dependent on throughput.","Price elasticity again it\u2019s really about usually other people\u2019s consumption of energy and their production process. So they are still interested and that going down. So we really haven't seen any early indicators either in an industrial or an energy platform that would cause us to be concerned at this point about 2015. I think that particularly with Europe up somewhat in the quarter, that we just don't see an area of softness.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","That sounds good. And then just another area of the portfolio, since you had the new investment there for iTrade. Can you kind of update us on what you're seeing for adoption and penetration trends, market share for that platform?","John Humphrey","You know, iTrade continues to perform really well particularly in the US and their order management system. That's been the \u2013 and that was really the main reason that we acquired iTrade was because of the \u2013 what we thought were favorable trends in order management being able to more seamlessly connect the supply chain for fresh and perishable goods and the grocery chain and that is continuing to prove out to be the case.","We've really refocused that business more on the US market and they kind of started to go outside the US and I think they got a little over their skis in terms of capability to deliver while they still had a \u2013 quite a bit of addressable market here in the US.","So they are growing very nicely in the US, outside the US not quite as much and we really think that the Foodlink acquisition and the capabilities beyond the supplier side, all the way back to the farm and the organic farmer side will really help extend the offerings that iTrade is going to be able to have. So we're encouraged by the progress there.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Thanks, John.","John Humphrey","","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","John Humphrey","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Just on the deals that you closed in the third quarter, could you just give us a little bit more color on the acquired revenues or the acquired EBITDA, how to think about the multiples, how to think about kind of an accretion profile into 2015?","John Humphrey","Sure. So we invested about $300 million in these three acquisitions between FoodLink, IPA, and SHP, and in total, we expect them to deliver in the high $20 million range in our first year of ownership. So we paid about 11 time, a little bit less 11 \u2013 little bit less than 11 times first year EBITDA and given the profile for these types of businesses, extremely asset light, high amount of recurring revenue, software type of margin profile, we think that we paid a fair price, but a very good price. So we're encouraged about that.","In terms of revenue, and these are going to have I think after the amortization charges it will probably be similar to the Roper margin profile. So I think you're looking at somewhere in the $75 million range for first year revenue.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brian Jellison","And we also have a cash and tax benefit that accretes\u2026","John Humphrey ","Yeah, there's a modest cash tax benefit included in that $300 million, maybe $10 million or so.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Great. And on the other side, Brian, this has been raised on prior calls, right, and you've got some really good assets and selling incomes with dilution and things like that. But you know I've heard a little bit of chatter. I don't know how real it is, but maybe on the pump side you guys might be looking to shed something there.","How should we think about the other side of kind of managing the portfolio and to your point, some of the stuff is going for high multiples and it's not maybe great assets, you've got some very good assets that perhaps will touch a very solid multiple in this consolidating environment that we're seeing?","Brian Jellison","Pretty much all the businesses are pretty good, as you say. I mean, we have only just a few product lines that are things that we wish were not part of the portfolio, but there are only a few of those. I think we do get bids from time-to-time from people about certain assets every once in awhile, we pursue then as a rule. It's hard to ever see those divestitures come to fruition because the after tax contribution is not a shareholder friendly result, right.","So, if we were going to divest anything we'd want to assure ourselves that the cash from the disposition had an immediate and great home, I'm sure that there are some assets we own that, you know, would perform as well as they do with us in another place or if you have an asset that has maybe growth characteristics, but it's a very dilutive cash return profile and somebody else wants to invest in it and has a lot of synergies with it and we can get a fair price for it then we're certainly not above disposing of some of those kind of things.","And I think a lot of people \u2013 our acquisition activity is just very intense and pricing is pretty high. So there are people who call us about possible divestures who wouldn't have called in the past as they are finding how much these things are really worth and they can't find anything else and ours are so much better. So it's certainly possible that you could see some portfolio adjustment in the next year.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. I was wondering if I could just slip one more in. Could you elaborate on what you said about security projects and I think you said K-12 in colleges [ph] are you seeing some cyclical let up there or is it is just kind of the programmatic nature of some of those projects, just kind of the state of those markets?","Brian Jellison","Yeah. It's really at CBORD & Horizon where CBORD in particular we had the one car technology that does everything on the campus or healthcare environment and they had some particularly big transactions the last large one I think was Northeastern University up there. That sort of cycling out and the university and healthcare campus activity decisions are really slow. So quotations are there.","And what happens on the projects is there is some throughput of other people\u2019s security hardware in addition to our systems. And so if you don't get that, which we didn't have in the third quarter much of, it brings down the revenue, but actually we had better operating results because the software portion and the license maintenance activity is at much higher margins. So what we were just trying to reflect is it didn't look like revenue was really strong, but actually the OP was quite strong.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thank you.","John Humphrey","And at the end of the day I mean, just to elaborate on that a little bit, at the end of the day CBORD is a software business. I mean, we do sell-through hardware in order to facilitate some of the security applications, but fundamentally, we look at the software and the maintenance revenue and the new license revenue out of that business as the ongoing health and growth of that business and with the lumpy projects around security that we'll add on top of that.","And as Brian said we're very encouraged by the nice growth in the maintenance revenue which is really their installed base and the annuity that comes along with everything they are providing for those customers.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter.","Brian Jellison","Thank you.","John Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","My first question is this one, I'm trying to square your comments on energy, our energy team today came out with a price deck, a WTI price deck of sub 80 for next year and Brian you mentioned in your prepared comments that large projects continue to get deferred. But the bookings were really strong in compressor controls and frankly across the rest of your business.","So, I'm just trying to just better understand the resiliency of compressor controls, Roper Pump, Cornell, and perhaps maybe if you could set the context how much of your business is aftermarket versus OE related that would be helpful?","John Humphrey","Well, let me address the second one first and I'm basically going to address it by saying we're going have to get back to you and we don't really think of it as OE and aftermarket as much as looking at our total exposure to oil & gas knowing that most of our applications are around throughput and efficiency and quality, whether it be in the refinery side for instrumentation that are measuring quality or throughput inefficiency like our compressor controls business.","We'd have a few modest applications that are more on the upstream side, but they are on the upstream production side, things like diesel engine, shut off valves, and dewatering pumps, because there's quite a bit of water that's used even on the production side in addition to the exploration side.","Very little of what we have I mean, is just kind of thinking through it. Very little goes to OEMs per se other then of course knowing you have drilling people who are doing drilling applications or production applications that I guess could be qualified as an OEM, but it's not really an OEM the way I think of it in terms of larger automotive type markets. It doesn't feel like that to me as we go through all of our businesses.","And then as far as the outlook on crude oil prices, I mean, we really don't see an awful lot of that. Most of the areas where we've seen delays or at least slower decision making for some of those large projects, I think they are more geopolitical in nature rather than price of oil in nature.","Brazil has been slower to make decisions around some of those things. Some areas of the Middle East not quite as fast on making some investments as what we might have expected. But it doesn't change the fact that energy is still doing extremely well. Our total oil and gas related businesses, I don't have it at my finger tips, but they were clearly up in the quarter and up on a year-to-date basis despite seeing the oil price start to come down.","So, it's something that we're keeping an eye on. We definitely benefit by having very lien, very nimble organizations that could act quickly, but at this point, we still see more opportunities than we see on the risk side.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That's helpful color, John. And maybe one follow-up. Brian, you mentioned earlier you talked about a $1 billion to a $1.5 billion in deals over the next 12 months. Clearly interest rates have moved lower again, valuations look more reasonable. Are you seeing any greater competition at this point and maybe you could just try to compare it versus what you've seen over the next \u2013 over last 6 to 12 months?","Brian Jellison","","I don't see that. Interest rates for the M&A market haven't had any material change. I mean, if there's anything, it would be a little bit of people yelling at the banks that they are seven and eight types debt stables are a little out of control and maybe some of the European banks that have been doing that routinely should think about it.","But the reality is we still see ridiculous amounts of debt financing on every transaction. We never see anything that\u2019s less than seven times stable debt, despite what other people are saying it shouldn't be above five or six what is, it\u2019s a lot above it. And there's a lot of private money available that's still happy to go in at sort of 5% kind of interest rates and still a lot of pick.","So prices are as high as they've ever been. There's a huge amount of stuff for sale. I mean, we have gone through more conversations this year with people than we've ever done in our history and still it's just their \u2013 just a huge amount of them. I mean, we'll be out tomorrow and we'll be out Wednesday on two more where management presentations are very robust. I don't think private equity has pulled back by one penny. I think some of the strategics have sort of given up.","But the kind of things we are looking at investing in are things that really want to be part of our company because of the nature in which we manage it and the governance process and the freedom and entrepreneurial people have to survive here. So we're not seeing any problem with the pipeline.","We would like to make a larger acquisition than we have, but there are certainly no shortage of $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $500 million transactions in front of us and the larger ones still such a frothy ability to issue equity that every \u2013 all the sellers who continue to talk to us haven't decided what they're going to do. But I think it's going to be easy for us to deploy quite a bit of capital here in the next 12 months in very attractive businesses.","","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Helpful, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll get back in queue.","","Brian Jellison","","Yeah.","","Operator","","We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","","Hi, good morning.","Brian Jellison","","Hey good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Just fourth quarter free cash flow and kind of the year number, what do you expect there for free cash flow percent net income?","Brian Jellison","Well, I think I don't know for the full year it should be 130%. I guess I'd have to see that for the fourth quarter.","John Humphrey","Yeah, fourth quarter should be in the range of $250 million of operating cash flow and let me take 10 off for CapEx, so that's how we spend on a per quarter basis. So we'll spend $40 million of CapEx roughly this year. So that I think keeps our full year operating cash flow conversion well above 130%.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Okay. And then just for next year, these deals you did, I think you answered this in Jeff's question maybe, but it would be the accretion for next year, is like $0.10 to $0.15 the right kind of number for those deals you've closed recently do you have kind of you know, booked and locked in for next year?","John Humphrey","No, it\u2019s\u2026","Brian Jellison","Just think about the way we think about it, right. So, we think about cash accretion, so on cash these are sort of very high margin businesses and they are growing rapidly and they are going contribute a good deal in cash in 2015.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","","Okay.","Brian Jellison","On what some up based EPS number it is, is far less critical than whether the quality of the earnings and cash that they generate is pretty good. Johns talking about them being in the high $20 plus million of EBITDA.","And so you can figure that out. If you care about a GAAP base EPS number, you can do the math. But we care about their compounding cash growth and they are going contribute well in excess of $25 million of EBITDA in 2015.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","So, the $0.10 to $0.15 converts at a higher rate or kind of the normal 130% rate?","Brian Jellison","On a GAAP EPS base, it's going to have a lot of\u2026","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Yeah, free cash flow, right.","John Humphrey","Yeah, it will be in that same range. When the nature of this right of course we have non-cash amortization charges\u2026","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Sure.","John Humphrey","And you always need to add those thing and tax effect those, but then add those back and so that gives us the natural increase in our operating cash flow well above the net earnings contribution.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Right. Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","Hi, good morning. First question in the Industrial business you talked about Neptune down from tough comps. Can you talk about mix of business generally? I know there's more of a technology high margin spend in this space now with flow meters and a lot of the RFs going to slightly different permutations. So if you could just comment a little bit on Neptune mix that would be great?","","John Humphrey","","Sure. I mean, the general trend in the industry is clearly is to purchase meters along with the technology embedded in that. So it's not too completely different streams and oftentimes you have water utilities that will decide to upgrade a project.","And so you'll have collectors, as well as devises to be able to collect that information. So you have the collectors that will gather the readings and send them back to the central office and also mobile communication devises.","But as a rule, most of the revenue for Neptune is going to be the meter technology, plus the radio and embedded encoder technology. So you can gather all that information and be able to send it back to someone.","And usually those are not purchased separately. And so we're having a split, I mean, still over two thirds probably closer to 75% of the new shipments for Neptune, the new revenue is the integrated meter or some integrated technology rather than just a meter that goes out that's still being direct read. And so that's where we see the market continuing to trend with the total systems purchase rather than the individual pieces.","","Brian Jellison","","Yeah, let me just make it clear that. That I wouldn't accept the premise that Neptune's down. We just said that they had an all-time record quarter in the third quarter of last year, so might be down a $1 million or $1.5 million compared to the prior period. But they are going to have likely a record year this year and they are having a very strong first nine months of the year and then they are going to do okay in the fourth quarter.","So let's be careful about how we phrase that compared to the competitive marketplace out there with other people who have old technology and have pretty mediocre revenue.","","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","","Yeah, I know that's fair. I'm just going off slide 12. And so lastly on my \u2013 the Medical and Scientific Imaging, I'm sorry if you mentioned this, geographic splits there, is that primarily North America or anything else internationally? Thank you.","","John Humphrey","","Sure. I mean, for this segment in total, it's not at all much very dissimilar. What you have is our medical products and medical software businesses, Sunquest and MHA, as well as our Verathon and other businesses. Those are probably a little more skewed to the United States. But our Imaging businesses are more global in nature.","So when you look at the segment in total it's about 70% US, 30% outside the US, but the differentiation there is that our outside the US portion is more imaging in our camera businesses rather than our medical businesses. That's still \u2013 and we're growing very nicely in medical even with US focus and still see the international opportunities still ahead of us.","","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","","Thank you.","Operator","","We'll go next to Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Good morning.","John Humphrey","Hi. Good morning, Alex.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Can you hear me?","John Humphrey","Yeah.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","I wanted to go back to this question of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion that you hope to spend in the next 12 months. How much have you spent this year? Do we have that total?","John Humphrey","$303 million I think.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","That's it for this year? So far\u2026","John Humphrey","Yeah, we didn't spend anything the first half of the year and we did the $303 million in the third quarter.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","So that really explains why when you're looking at the growth for the year, you've got 6% to 7% forecast organic and 8% to 9% total. So you really haven't added all that much revenue this year to the total.","When we talk about next year what would be, do you have any idea of the timing of that spend whether it's in the beginning of the year or the end of the year and in other words what's it going to add to revenue?","John Humphrey","We will really never know the timing, Alex. I mean, we had the diligence that we do is very time consuming and everybody that's been through our process understands. So while we can process a lot of stuff simultaneously. We're almost always looking at least four things at any point in time and you just never know whether they get into the finish line.","We don't have a budget for acquisitions and we always want to do the best thing as opposed to just doing something. So when you get to acquire something like IPA and SHP, I mean, we have one of the thought leaders in the world with probably running SHP and some phenomenal business very, very, very exciting for us to do that and we could have done a couple of other things that would have had larger revenue, but don't have the compound cash growth that we like.","So it's very important for the acquired management team to be able to fit into our culture. People have a good deal of freedom, but for the same token they've got to have a thorough understanding of cash return and where we want to exploit multiple channels of distribution and how we think pricing should go and how you should invest in R&D.","And candidly most people don't have those values. They just wait for cyclical markets to change. But our people have to really evolve markets and they've got to have a long-term view of what it is they're doing because they are the ones that are driving the applications in the marketplace.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","You alluded to the fact that you are looking at companies who really want to join Roper as opposed to some big industrial conglomerate or whatever. But if they are owned by private equity investors, do they really have the say in who they want to be bought by?","John Humphrey","Well some do some don't. It really depends on \u2013 when the private equity guys own the business, if the management team will not convey to a new private equity owner then the private equity guys have to behave very differently. Sometimes the management people have a desire to go through and 5 year situation where they can't invest in the future and hope for an exit that will be okay, but the kind of people that want to work here don't think that way.","They've been inside private equity for awhile. They want to invest to grow their business over the long-term and we're a great home for people who want to invest and grow over the long-term.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","One more follow-up. Roper Pump is ramping up in Houston. What's the capacity utilization now? In other words how much further can you ramp it?","John Humphrey","Oh! We could double certainly from where it is today. Its got \u2013 it has some sophisticated process equipment that's running three shifts, but most of the activity is only on a one or a shift and a half basis and the people that we're providing product to are releasing more and more of their content and a lot of what they are doing in Houston is called relining of these drill bits.","And so, it's not \u2013 you know, and the answer, it\u2019s really on the exploration side that has to drive their growth as long as they're continuing to operate. These things have got to come back to be willing because they wear and that\u2019s the Houston thing is a big relining operation.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay. Thank you.","John Humphrey","Welcome.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Kayla, and thank you all for joining us.

A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix.","For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of a purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions. The total of this is about $1.9 million, which is an add back to both revenue and to operating profit. As a reminder, this represents revenue absent our acquisition those businesses would have recognized, this is solely as a result of our acquisition that requires us to have this revenue adjustment.","And now if you please turn to the next slide, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thanks John, good morning everybody, I think I have a slide that says Q1 enterprise results, so we'll turn past that and discuss Roper Technologies just for a minute. We're delighted to be bringing this morning\u2019s call to you as Roper Technologies for the first time. We changed the name after the market closed on Friday. The ticker symbol is going to remain the same at ROP, the way The New York Stock Exchange works, our name changes takes perhaps two days for the trades to go in as Roper Technologies, but you're certainly available to buy the stock today. You can expect to begin trading on Wednesday we believe in the Roper Tech and John mentioned its ropertech.com now for the website, that's been changed over the weekend, I think the link to these slides are on it. If you're having any trouble with normal page [ph], you can go there.","And the seasons for Roper Technologies is sort of obvious, I think for those of us that have been talking with you for the last several years, all you have to really do is look at our gross margins, which this quarter are 60% to recognize, this simply is not an industrial company. The quality of our businesses, the nature of the amount of money they reinvest to grow themselves and develop technology, the gross margins they have and their long-term growth rates reflect the idea that really is a technology company now and the opportunities that we have are far greater than they used to be a decade ago, when people where focused on product businesses as opposed to software and medical technologies and information networks that could become ubiquitous for niche applications.","Next slide. If we look at the first quarter enterprise results, we were able to power through any of the difficulties with oil and gas upstream stuff that people were talking about including ourselves going into the quarter. So we achieved record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Our organic revenue was up 5%, we had established guidance at around 3% to 5% throughout the year, Q1 being strong and Q3 being strong we think over the course of the year on the organic slide. Growth clearly was led by medical and radio frequency segments and I'll talk specifically about those shortly. Foreign exchange caused us 3% in the quarter on revenue.","Our gross margins as I mentioned hit 60% which is a historical breakthrough for us, they were up 140 basis points. The operating margin was up 190 basis points, speaking again to leverage and efficiency, to 28.7%. When you think about amortization, the non-cash amortization we have, if you looked at our EBITA results that's how you can see, we do so well on cash, they were 33% in the quarter. Net earnings were up 7% to $157 million, DEPS $1.55. Much more importantly is the cash, we had the same number of shares that generate cash as generate net earnings and our free cash flow was $250 million, up 24% in the quarter compared to the $157 million that we report on a diluted EPS basis.","We deployed $590 million on three great medical software companies. We\u2019ll explain those three during course of the morning. So, we\u2019re really positioned after Q1, which was probably going to -- we always thought it would have been the weakest quarter we had for a record 2015.","Next slide. If we look at the income statement in Q1, you\u2019ll see book-to-bill was 0.98. You may remember we\u2019re always talking about 0.97 to 1.03 is kind of a span that\u2019s meaning once it just, normal sea, because we have so many different issues around when projects did and what have you. So, we\u2019re quite comfortable with that.","Revenue, as we said, was up 5%, despite the 3% FX headwinds. As reported, it\u2019s 4%, on an organic basis, it\u2019s 5%. If we look at the gross profit, one of the points I make in addition to the 60% reflecting our technology platforms, it\u2019s really amazing to grow a 140 basis points of gross margin in a quarter. If you were a 35% gross margin company, getting into 36%, people would be raving about it. But wholly [ph] it\u2019s just amazing when you\u2019re at 58.6% that you can get it to 60%.","Operating income was up 11% to $249 million. We mentioned the margin up 190 basis points above the gross margin improvement. The earnings before tax were up 11%, but we had real tax headwinds in the first quarter compared to last year. You\u2019ll see our tax rate was up 300 basis points and the headwind cost us $0.07 a share. Even with that, the DEPS still were $1.55 against $1.46 last year.","Next slide. If you look at our cash flow, it continues to amaze as we compound the cash flow, because I suppose if you are using one word to describe the Company any more, it might be that they\u2019re really a compounder. Our first quarter cash flow of $260 million is a 22% increase and we spent around $10 million in CapEx.","So, our free cash flow, as we said, is up 24%. The conversion rate on our free cash flow is 161%. Now, that\u2019s beyond spectacular. It represents almost 29% of free cash flow to sales, but in the first quarter, we don\u2019t have US fed tax cash payment. So, it tends to be just a little bit overstated in the first quarter. You can see for that reason, we put the trailing 12 months free cash flow of $851 million, which is 24% of revenue and a conversion rate on a trailing 12 months basis of 130% in kind of keeping with our commitments that we expect it always to be above 120% over the course of the year.","We still believe strongly that cash is the best measure of performance, not some of the things that other people look at. We don\u2019t provide cash per share, but we sure think about how much the cash is year-over-year.","Next slide. The asset-like business model, it\u2019s really a critical important, because, well, lot of people talk about business systems. Basically, our governance process model is our business system and one of its core components is our focus on working capital. Here you can see, if we just look at the last couple of years, inventory has dropped from the end of the first quarter of 2013 at 6.8% to 5.7%. In this quarter, receivables have come in a little bit. Payables and accruals are about the same as they were. So, we find that our net working capital number for the end of Q1 is 5%. That\u2019s a 270 basis point improvement in just two years\u2019 time.","And what I think is incredibly important is if you look at the long history of this continuous journey we\u2019ve had on getting more asset-like having much higher velocity, I looked back at where we were in the first quarter ten years ago in 2005, and at that time, our inventory was around 10% versus 5.7% today and receivables were 18.4%. The payables and accruals were about 14% versus 18%. So, when you net those numbers ten years ago, we were above 14% in net working capital and here we are now at 5% and I can assure you that our governance process, it has a great deal to do with that focus. ","Next slide. We look at financial position of the company. You can see that cash has gone up from a year-ago\u2019s quarter from $500 million [ph] to $615 million. Our cash and undrawn revolver is still $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA has gone up from $1.118 billion to $1.223 billion. And what is really clear is, in the last nine months, we have deployed $900 million in acquisitions and yet our gross debt ratio is exactly the same as it was a year ago at 2.1 and our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.6. ","So our balance sheet still has large room for us to continue to make acquisitions over the next 12 months to 15 months and there are a lot of exciting things that we are involved with today. So we feel that both the balance sheet and pipeline are very strong.","Next slide. Here we will get into the specific segment detail of each of the segments. So the next slide is our first quarter 2015 segment performance, where you can see how the four layout, they all have great gross margins and EBITDA margins. But the power of our RF and Medical Technology businesses becomes much, much clear to people when you look these slides. You will see for instance, Medical alone in the quarter generated $135 million of EBITDA. If you added both Energy at $36 million and Industrial at $63 million together, you get $99 million. So Medical was a 136% more EBITDA than those other two businesses combined. And if we look at RF and Medical, they represented 69% of the enterprise EBITDA compared to 30% for the Industrial and Energy businesses.","Next slide. The first segment we\u2019ll review today is the Energy System, because it\u2019s \u2013 we will go with smallest to largest. As you can see in the pie chart, Energy business in Q1 represented 11% of Roper EBITDA. It had negative organic growth of 5% and FX cost of 5%. ","The oil and gas markets were as weak as we expected. Upstream businesses, particularly in orders was down double-digits and we don\u2019t see that really improving throughout the year, I think could probably deteriorate a little further. Large projects remain particularly slow, which affects our compressor controls business, and still has decent opportunity in front of it. But cost actions were taken in some of these businesses that are all nimble. They have a huge advantage because we just have this asset wide footprint everywhere, so we don\u2019t have to do much around plans, but we have done a few things investing a little less than $1 million in restructuring charges within the quarter and that\u2019s inside the numbers, not an excluded item.","We had modest organic growth in the refinery application businesses. People seem to feel that\u2019s going to continue to improve throughout the year. Our other served markets in Energy, which represents about 40% of the segment, couple of those businesses that were instrumentation oriented were up and a couple of the businesses that were sensor products were down. ","For the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year, we would think the oil and gas markets will remain challenging with 20% of this business upstream and 40% down to Midstream. We wouldn\u2019t see that improving during the course of the year, but sequentially it will get better, just because Q1 is always our lowest quarter. ","We think we will have flat to modest growth in the other served markets that we have that report through the Energy Systems segment. The FX headwind should drive mid-single digit segment decline for the balance of the year in our opinion, but we do think we will have a stronger sequential reporting numbers in the second quarter than we did in the first and I would point out that gross margins in Energy in the first quarter were still 55%. So this is not a business that\u2019s under siege by any stretch.","Next slide. Here if we look Industrial Technology, organic revenue was actually just modestly positive, one point of organic revenue. We had FX headwinds, which were a negative four points in here. The share gains at Roper Pump gave us double-digit growth despite the declines in the upstream market, which is exactly what we predicted when we established the guidance. ","Neptune\u2019s Toronto project is nearing a successful conclusion. It\u2019s down year-over-year on a quarter basis and it will start to be down a little bit more than that in the second, third and fourth quarters compared to the prior year, so it\u2019s a headwind basically for the company. ","We had growth at our Cornell Pump business that was driven by new products and the niche applications that they are involved with. They may have a little bit of a tougher time with rental companies in the latter part of year, but it's still holding up well at the moment. Our Material Analysis businesses were down slightly, but we had terrific orders, in fact all-time record orders for our stores [ph] business in the first quarter which was a pleasant surprise. ","If we look at that project completion for Toronto, we think it should be sometime in the summer. We think we will continue to have weakness in the upstream portion of fluid handling for Roper and Cornell. The Material Analysis business, we think, will continue to improve and given the FX headwinds, we would expect kind of mid-single-digit segment decline for the balance of the year after a little bit of positive and this represents about 20% of the EBITDA for the Enterprise. ","Next slide, here is Ropers RF technology business. That business had organic revenue growth in the quarter of 11% and had a point of FX headwind and we actually sold our product line, which is called Black Diamond, that was a defense oriented rugged computer technology that really belonged in the hands of somebody that was clearly in that business. And we achieved a sale of that product line in the quarter which added a little downward pressure and it\u2019s been removed from the base line. ","We had very strong growth in toll and traffic, our technology which is trademarked Infinity Digital Lane Systems continues to be deployed rapidly in Florida and Texas and the bidding activity around our Infinity Lane Systems is very robust. We had very significant tag shipments that benefitted both the revenue and the operating margin. You can see the OP profit at $74 million was up 19% compared to the first quarter of a year ago. And we had quite significant subscriber additions to our SaaS based freight matching model which gave us double-digit growth and normally that is a business that grows toward a single digit. So that was very encouraging.","For the second part of the year, Q2 through Q4, we think the backlog is going to support the toll and traffic growth. The Riyadh project begins in earnest in the second quarter and our tag shipments strength that we expect to continue with kind of known places for deployment. Our software and SaaS businesses we think will grow mid-single-digits, but they do give us very, very outstanding cash return. So modest growth there as always with a lot of cash. And we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic growth for the segments for the balance of the year. And you can see RF represents 27% of our EBITDA here in the pie. ","Next slide. If you look at Medical Solutions, Medical was up 15% in revenue and 22% in operating profit and OP margin was up 230 basis points to 37.3% and it\u2019s lot of non-cash amortization in Medical. If I look at the EBITA margin, it\u2019s 44.9%, so truly outstanding businesses. Organic revenue was up 7%, we get the 3 points in negative FX in there. ","Our MHA business had double-digit growth that was really driven by market conditions and new customer additions that we\u2019ve gotten as they continue to focus on building that platform. We had double-digit growth at our Verathon product business. We got a series of product introductions we talked about last year, all of which are doing well and we continue to build out their channel to get better coverage.","Sunquest growth continued despite a difficult comparison. Last year, we had a considerable revenue as a result of implementing meaningful use program. So one thing is to sell the software, but implementation is different \u2013 a diverse revenue stream and that heightened last year\u2019s numbers, so it will be difficult as a comp throughout this year, but the underlying recurring revenue continues to grow nicely.","The Scientific Imaging businesses were pretty flat here. As you will notice, we are really calling out the segment as Medical Solutions, because the Scientific Imaging portion really is down pretty much microscopy applications. There is not a lot of stuff here to talk about anymore. We did deploy $590 million of investment in three great medical software acquisitions for the medical solutions business. I will explain those in a moment. For the balance of the year, we think MHA is going to continue to benefit from favorable market conditions, most of us appear to be getting older and there are a whole wide variety of people that provide services to and the execution that MHA has is really, really world-class.","Sunquest, we think, is going to continue to perform well against those difficult comps I mentioned above and Sunquest has a great deal of initiatives around 2016 that are gaining momentum, certainly did in the first quarter and are continuing now. Some of those, we can't really talk a lot about because they\u2019re proprietary, but they\u2019re very exciting development opportunities for Sunquest. ","The medical products growth we think would be led by Verathon and Northern Digital in the last three quarters as their pace picks up particularly there. We think we will get mid-teens revenue growth for the segment and the acquisitions that we made in the quarter are really going to help our future growth, because there are synergies in the marketplace as they coordinate more with Sunquest and MHA in the future.","Next slide, if we look at these three healthcare IT acquisitions, these are all software companies, the first Strata Decision Technologies in Chicago has great leader, a wonderful team, they\u2019re really providing subscription financial analytics and performance platforms for hospitals. These enterprise-wide things are really around the effectiveness and cost reduction opportunities for hospitals and decision support, so that they can kind of think of themselves a little bit more like the rest of us think about cost and continuous improvement and the technology is really spectacular.","Now, they are already in one out of five US hospitals with one or more of their applications, but they are very early stage for the new applications that have been developed, which is part of the reason we -- they really needed to be acquired by somebody like us who can rapidly invest in the development of those.","SoftWriters is a business that\u2019s going to be co-ordinated with MHA, it's in the long-term care pharmacy space, it provides enterprise software for people who do that work, it has on-premise software delivery, models that get recurred billing, e-prescriptions or something that rapidly is growing and this facilitates that. They have the exact same customer base really as MHA, so the two together are going to create a better service footprint for customers.","In Data Innovations, this is a business that will closely align with Sunquest. It\u2019s the largest clinical and blood laboratory middleware provider and if you think about middleware, you might think about you having to download your printer driver to get your laptop or CPU to print properly well. Data Innovations for one of a better way to explain it is really the ability to connect to communicate between lab instruments and the tests that are deployed and then that information showing up where the hospital needs to have it.","The Data Innovations has the largest library with over 1,000 laboratory devices, types of devices connected all over the world. They are deployed in 80 countries and you can just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tests and feedback that are required to the clinical use of the data that they are interacting with. This adds a lot to our Sunquest capabilities in the hospital laboratory markets and both companies should be better as a result of the synergies that we get out of this transaction.","Next slide would be to update our guidance. When we look at the next slide, if you look at the second quarter and the full year guidance, we\u2019re raising the guidance from $6.70 to $6.75 on the low-end, up to $6.95 at the high-end. Unfortunately, the FX headwinds are much greater. We started the year with using the year-end number and that created a $0.10 drag. That's now up to $0.25 drag as a result of where the currencies are at the end of the first quarter. ","Our tax rate, we still expect to be sort of 30% to 31%, a little higher it was in the first quarter. Organic growth, we think, will still be in the 3% to 5% thing with the Q1 being strong, Q3 organic should be strong, second quarter probably not as strong and the fourth quarter, if we get normal, year-end activity should be pretty strong again. ","We are going to raise our full-year cash flow to $925 million and we established guidance in the second quarter with $1.59 to $1.64, which recognizes the FX challenge that we will have there.","Next slide. If we look down at the summary before we open it for questions, we had basically record results across the board in the quarter, which is a nice way to start out with Roper Technologies. Organic growth at 5%, with Medical and RF driving mostly all of them. Operating margins at astonishing records at 28.7% and free cash flow up 24% to $250 million, demonstrating the importance of focusing on how much cash people generate versus sometimes people looking too much on the net earnings number. ","We deployed $590 million on those three great acquisitions, the pipeline is terrific. We have a lot of things open that we are interested in and several things that we are really excited about. We do think we will have a record year in 2015, just powering through the end market challenges we have in some of our businesses. And we are able to raise our DEPS and cash flow guidance even though the FX headwinds increased by another $0.15 a share. ","So with that, we would like to open it up for questions for the first time for Roper Technologies.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning everyone and congratulations on the name change. ","John Humphrey","Hey, thank you. ","Brian Jellison","Good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","Just to start off, may be expand your comments on the market share gains at Roper Pump, just the timing of this is pretty impressive that despite all the worries about oil, you\u2019ve got the ability to grow market share. Are you getting price and are you building backlog in that business?","Brian Jellison","Well, the thing you want to balance that off with is that, we invested in a new facility that gave us larger diameter opportunities to provide product in the drilling side of the business, and that came live in the second half of last year has been building. So we have favorable comp in the first half of this year where that continues to go up. ","The upstream business on the core pump technology was okay in the first quarter, but we expect it to be off throughout the remainder of the year. And in the second half of the year, we will circle up with the comps from last year. So it will still be better than a year ago and it helps us at the expense of certain other people that we are making those products. In addition, these drill things get relined. So that\u2019s like a continuous thing that happens no matter what the level of new drilling is should get the relining and that\u2019s a significant business, which is what we do in Houston. ","So all that\u2019s good. But you still have to moderate that with the fact that the absolute core portion of the upstream pump business will decline throughout the year.","John Humphrey","And as far as the second part of your question, Deane around pricing, it\u2019s bit of \u2013 well, it\u2019s really been a technology provider more so than a broad line supplier to the end market in total. So we have very niche applications where in many cases, we are the only person who can really provide the solution that\u2019s being required. So as we went through all of our quarterly reviews as far as the things that we did ask about and test, but so far that\u2019s not a concern for us. I think that\u2019s also reflected in the fact that gross margin continues to be very strong inside both the Energy and Industrial segments where it was 55% in Energy and 50% in Industrial. So that\u2019s really the proof with respect to price, if that\u2019s holding well then gross margins generally hold well.","Deane Dray","Thanks. And can you provide some more color on the restructuring actions that you\u2019ve taken. I know Roper is not big on doing any centralized head quarter directed restructuring. So on the $1 million that\u2019s been done so far, is there more to do and what kind of payback are you expecting?","Brian Jellison","You know, the payback comes within the year itself, so it\u2019s \u2013 these are always just discontinued activity and a reduction in headcount. People are very quick to do that. We had everybody together in December challenging field plans for 2015, which we thought were optimistic and unfortunately we were proven correct. So, early in the first quarter as they were monitoring January and then February, they took actions in February based on the first level of trip equilibrium. I think they have other things that they could do in the second quarter and then they generally would be around equivalent stock. There aren't any plant sections to close or things like that, it's just not how the business works, there is very light factory footprints at the end of all those businesses. So we don't have anything planned in Q2, but I think you have things more to deteriorate further, they take out more people.","Deane Dray","And then just last question from me. Was the Black Diamond divestiture, was that the divestiture that you talked about a small divestiture you're contemplating, is that the one and could you size that for us please?","John Humphrey","It was a very modest divestiture, it's a business that -- it\u2019s a product line that we had picked up a few years back, may be six, seven years ago, and made some investments in order to better commercial that technology. And at the end of the day, because of its focus on defense related activity, it's sort of the only business, the only product line that we had that sold into the defense world. And so it just wasn't a good fit for us, and we actually found a home that we think is going to be much better fit. But at the end of the day, was a very, very modest transaction.","Deane Dray","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Shannon O' Callaghan at UBS.","Shannon O' Callaghan","Good morning guys.","Brian Jellison ","Hey, good morning Shannon.","Shannon O' Callaghan","Okay, on the 60% growth margin in the first quarter, maybe just a little more color on that, I mean, as you said, up 140 bps is a lot, and to see that in 1Q. A little more color on what drove that, where there any mix things that were unique to the quarter or how much of it sort of sustained itself?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, if you look at, industrial is about 50%, which was the same as it was before, energy was 55%, its quite similar to where it was and RF was 54%, up a little bit but medical at 74% gross margin. So, as it drives a bigger and bigger every increasing piece of the enterprise that really helps and then, frankly pricing is holding quite well for us across the board in all four segments. And people have been very focused here on gross margin and they\u2019re very focused on asset velocity, so it just gets constant attention the way we look at our business model.","John Humphrey","And this is a situation where the mix effect is the result of strategic actions that we have taken over the years, right. So, those areas that have higher gross margin was generally our higher quality businesses, they are higher quality because they are providing a service, they're providing a solution that they\u2019re able to get paid for. And so that quality measure and our continued investment in those areas is reflected and the fact that our gross margin is higher.","Shannon O' Callaghan","Okay, great. And then just, on sort of, then I guess the non oil and gas parts of energy to some degree, you've got the organic revenue growth in the first quarter down 5%, and FX down 5%, so total down 10%. For the year, you're saying, down mid-single, oil is not expecting to get better, what does get better there in terms of easing pressure or I guess improving growth for the year?","John Humphrey","So it's going to be the non-upstream portions of that business. So the other markets that are served there, which aren't oil and gas related which is about 40% of the segment. And then, frankly there are some things that are expected to occur on the downstream market, particularly for our CTC business and some projects that they have very good line of sight on.","Some of those have been lower on the decision making, so I think you've started to see that but those are still things that we expect to see with still investment around the world and things like L&G plants and other applications. So it's going to the non-upstream but you're right, we don't expect the upstream to get any better.","Shannon O' Callaghan","Okay, great thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Moving next to Steve Tusa at J.P. Morgan.","Steve Tusa","All right, good morning.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just talk about the -- I guess just in general what the -- kind of second quarter organic number is going to be?","John Humphrey","Well, we\u2019ve to look it all again in the second quarter. Expectation is that we\u2019ll also be somewhere in the probably 3% to 5% range, probably closer to 3% and 5%. So, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s baked into our guidance and expectation for the second quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And as far as the kind of midpoint to midpoint, I mean, you have some things moving around here. Obviously, kudos to you guys for being able to raise the guidance when others are clearly cutting. Could you maybe just walk us midpoint to midpoint? You gave us the forex headwind, tax little bit of a headwind. How much of the offset is on the EPS line is on from acquisitions?","Brian Jellison","Well, the acquisitions are about the same as the FX. [00:01:04]They\u2019re pretty close to neutralizing the X, which is really good, generally you know they\u2019re going to be strong cash accretion, but actually they\u2019re going to be EPS accretive. So, they largely make up for that FX headwind that went up by $0.15.","John Humphrey","And rest of the operations -- and rest of the operations, Steve, we\u2019ve some puts and takes by segment versus what we thought maybe 90 days ago both industrial and energy are little bit weaker than what we thought but that\u2019s more than offset by the fact that medical and our toll and traffic businesses are better than we would have expected 90 days ago. So, the continued push in those areas and the performance out of those businesses is doing a little bit better than the weakness that we see on the energy side.","Steve Tusa","Right. And then just to confirm, so, obviously, if you guys are doing around closer to the 3% in the second quarter, there are things that kind of pick up for you in the back half of the year on the kind of getting you comfortably within the 3% to 5% range?","Brian Jellison","Absolutely.","John Humphrey","Probably so.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one more question. Just -- Brian, maybe just the state of the union on the deal environment?","Brian Jellison","Well, it\u2019s kind of encouraging, we got a couple of deals that people were trying to sell that did not get done, which is a nice early warning indicator for people who may not have adjusted their valuation expectations. And you got a lot of people who are interested in getting deals done because it\u2019s not quite clear how the high yield credit markets are going to hold up here in perpetuity when guys are looking and say, 450 basis points spreads on high yield.","There is amazing amount of different opinions around how that goes, but there is a great deal of assets that are in the marketplace for sale. I just think you have to work harder than ever because a lot of the best things have traded in the last couple of years and some of the really great things that are out there people are kind of holding off on until next year, but given the fact that we want to deploy another $1 billion, $1.5 billion in the next 12 months, we don\u2019t really have. We\u2019re going to see a challenge around that, it\u2019s easy to do. It\u2019s getting harder to find $2 billion deal right now than it was two years ago, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit better environment for transactions than it was.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks, good morning.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn","Good morning. So, just had a question about the levity in the margin at RF and what are the takeaways there between volume leverage mix and then maybe productivity or value-based pricing? I know there was some succession there.","John Humphrey","You mean -- I\u2019m sorry, you said that with respect to RF?","Christopher Glynn","Yes.","John Humphrey","So, what did you see in RF for this quarter, particularly, is very strong performance and high shipments of tags and associated technology from our toll and traffic business. So, Chris as you know, we have -- inside there, we have the very consistently high margin software businesses. And so, the variances are generally going to be driven by our toll and traffic business. If you have more project work, then it adds pressure on the margin, but if you have more hardware, tag and technology shipments, then you have margin upside and that\u2019s what we saw this quarter. So, very shipments for the Infinity Lane system as well as additional tags being sold and shipped to Texas and Florida and lots of other places, North Carolina, et cetera, Oklahoma also. So those tagged shipments help us out on the margin front and that was the case for the first quarter.","Christopher Glynn","And is there a long-term shift underway towards more favorable mix within toll and traffic?","Brian Jellison","What's happening is that there are, Infinity Lane Technology is really very proprietary, right, so more and more people recognize how much more effective it is as a technology than other things people have used for a very long period of time and I think it will be for some considerable period, longer, a bigger piece of the pie and so as that happens, that's very beneficial.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. And then on a separate matter, to what extent are MHA and Sunquest now identifying some of the deals and how -- with these properties, how is the deal sourcing process evolving, is it becoming more distributed?","Brian Jellison","Yes and no. What happens is that they have really wide platforms that you can add things to and there are a lot of small niche businesses that can be helped by joining up with either an MHA or Sunquest and they are very well known to us. So there is a long list of things that we could continue to build out, but we are also building the human capital inside both these businesses quickly.","So we've added the people that are running Data Innovations and software and Strata. These are really great people. And so they bring with them the ability to make bolt-on stuff and get it integrated much more effective than some of the other businesses we\u2019ve owned in the past. So that's helpful and there are a lot of small players. I mean we've invested $900 million in the last nine months, but we\u2019ve done six deals to do it and our general ammo would be we would have done $1 billion transaction like an MHA. ","So having the leadership teams at MHA and Sunquest makes the acquisition -- capital deployment investment situation easier for us. Now that said, we are still doing it here and so we will bring those management teams with us, but the decision around capital deployment is going to remain at the headquarters.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Congrats on the recent deals.","Brian Jellison","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Hi, just a couple of questions. Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Just a couple of questions on the tolling business, traffic and tolling business, was the Riyadh order, was that booked in the first quarter here?","Brian Jellison","Part of it.","John Humphrey","Yeah. A very small portion was in the first quarter, but the bulk of that was in the second quarter.","Richard Eastman","Was in the second quarter, okay. And then you said, is that the Infinity\u2026 Sorry.","John Humphrey","Rick, I'm sorry, I misspoke. It was booked in the first quarter.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then is that for the Infinity Lane system, does that project include that?","John Humphrey","No, it does not. This is a signaling and traffic management solution, so the trends with software as well as all of the other work that goes along with putting in a modern traffic management system inside a very congested city is what that project is. So it's not a toll solution, it's a traffic management solution.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And so just conversely then as Riyadh starts to ship in the second quarter, the margins in the toll, in the RF business probably settled down a bit with that mix? Is that a fair way to think about the margin profile going forward?","John Humphrey","The overall mix, particularly at the beginning, is going to be lower. So think of it as Manhattan, where we -- TransSuite runs the traffic light system in Manhattan. So that's what we are going to do in Riyadh, but there is a lot of heavy lifting upfront to accommodate the ability to get this technology embedded everyplace it needs to be. So the technology is higher margin, but the service component with local people doing that work will be low margin and this is a lower margin stuff.","Richard Eastman","Sure, okay. And then just a quick question on the core local currency growth rate assumption, when you mention industrial tech and also the energy business, I'm thinking you had commented on the total growth for those segments, including FX. So if we just back out FX for the industrial tech business, is the core growth there still modest positive and then for energy is it -- what does that look like without currency for the full year?","Brian Jellison","Okay. So for the full year, so let me go for the remainder of the year, so for the remainder of the year, we expect energy to be about flat on an organic basis, plus or minus a little bit. ","Richard Eastman","Yes, okay. And then industrial tech?","Brian Jellison","And industrial tech is very similar. Once again, remember we are completing the Toronto project. So the completion of that project gives us about a $30 million headwind this year in total. And so including that, we expect on an organic basis, industrial will also be maybe flat, maybe up a little bit.","Richard Eastman","Okay, I'm with you. Okay, so that's really unchanged from the expectation post 4Q?","Brian Jellison","I would say it's modestly lower, but we are also modestly a little bit more bullish on the Medical and what we are seeing out of RF. ","Richard Eastman","Yes, very good. Okay, thank you much. Very nice quarter.","Brian Jellison","Thanks.","Operator","And we will go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Sir?","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Brian Jellison","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So my first question, I guess with the name change to Roper Technologies, just maybe a broader question. Any thoughts on larger scale portfolio divestitures? I know you did one during this quarter. Clearly you are moving much more towards a software\/SaaS-based model, and so I'm just curious, Brian, whether that changes what you currently have within your portfolio today?","Brian Jellison","No, I don't think so. I mean all our businesses, when you look at our energy businesses or the industrial businesses, they have over 50% gross margin. So the economics of this business is similar to most of the technology company you would see that are not pure software. Our software business has outperformed software companies, our industrial business has outperformed industrial companies.","So as long as we get outperformance out of these things, we think the market is incredibly smart and it has pretty idea about what things are worth and while we're always undervalued we think that it's very hard to ever get rid of anything we have here. It would have to be a compelling reason and those certainly could exist in the future, it really could. But today we think we're perfectly positioned and I think this quarter sort of demonstrates that.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, that's helpful. John, maybe following up on your comment on energy, with the start to the year down 5% on the organic growth side and the expectation to get to flat, I guess two questions. What's driving the confidence in the uptick in energy as the year progresses? And then secondly, just within the margin profile this quarter, I saw that your operating margins were down about 200 basis points. I know part of that was the restructuring. But what else really kind of drove the decline in operating margins on the energy business?","John Humphrey","Yeah, so I will take the second question first. If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18%, if you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pull the one-time expenses associated with restructuring out of that. When you get down into the mid-30% range for the decremental leverage, that's not at all different than what we would expect. We actually think that's very impressive performance out of those businesses, given that they start with 55% gross margin. So they are real cost actions, real belt-tightening that has to happen and that will happen and it has and will continue to happen in order to be able to hold that decremental leverage in the mid-30% to 40% range.","Now, as far as going forward, when you think about sequential improvements little bit throughout the year, like I said, it's really driven by the non-oil-and-gas portion. So our things that are selling into, whether it would be plastics or polymers or non-destructive testing, other markets that are not oil and gas related, which is about 40% of the segment, that was down modestly in the first quarter. We expect that to be up modestly as we go forward throughout the year.","And then the other piece is the timing associated with some of the project deliveries at CCC, which most of those are for downstream and midstream applications, more downstream frankly. And those are things that we expect to come to fruition later in the year. So those are the drivers for why we expect the minus 5% organic in the first quarter to be closer to flat throughout the rest of the year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And then just a clarification there. The decremental average that you talked about organically, that didn\u2019t include any pricing pressure in the quarter, and is the expectation as the year progresses that price will continue to hold?","John Humphrey","For the specific areas that we play in, that is the expectation and I wouldn\u2019t separate it out as pricing versus cost, I would separate it out as gross margin. So gross margin was actually flat in the quarter versus last year for Energy at 55.4% and we expect to be able to hold our gross margin very similar to what we had last year in this segment, which on a full year basis was right at 58% and we see no reason that that won\u2019t be the case this year as well with the actions that have already been taken.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, great. I mean, one last question Brian on the free cash flow conversion that was really impressive this quarter. I know that some of that must have also \u2013 the acquisitions must have buoyed some of the conversion, but your free cash flow conversion has been moving up steadily with the acquisitions that you have done in Medical and Scientific Imaging. ","The question I have is, is the 130% conversion target that you \u2013 that we have used kind of like a long-term target, is that the right target, or are you continuing to move above that target as you progress over the long-term?","Brian Jellison","Well, I think the 130% is what we have said is a trailing 12-months actual with $851 million in free cash flow. So our cashbacks isn\u2019t going to be moving up, it\u2019s going to be 1% to 1.5% of revenue and our operating cash flow is going to continue to escalate a little bit. It\u2019s already best in class. The conversion rate, we always talk about it being expected to be above 120% over time, so actually the 130%, it\u2019s kind of crept up above that. ","The things that we have will continue to improve a little bit, our legacy business actually just have been improving. They frankly tripled their cash return on investment in the last decade, which nobody recognizes and the acquisitions help. But I don\u2019t think our conversion ratios are likely to change dramatically. They\u2019re enormous and I just wish we get more people to talk about our real cash earnings instead of talking about the DEPS number, not commenting enough about the non-cash intangible amortization stuff. ","Joe Ritchie","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you, good morning gentlemen. Just a question around the Medical businesses, Brian. You know, if I think about a lot of your businesses historically, they have kind of been portfolio companies and have not particularly integrated. But it seems like that is now starting to happen with some of these software deals and it obviously makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s kind of dizzying to think about how many software systems a hospital might have, and if you think about all these different things, you\u2019re starting to put together. ","I guess the nature of my question really is, is there a significant opportunity to do that? Do you move to kind of a larger provider of software systems with kind of different modalities and things that you\u2019re selling out of a bundle or do you see these businesses actually remaining fairly separate, maybe there is a few that overlap?","Brian Jellison","Well, that\u2019s a good and complicated question. It\u2019s absolutely true that there is going to be more interaction between some of these niche businesses that are acquired that are smaller with the two big footprint businesses MHA and Sunquest than we would have had in the past. If you think about Neptune, we never added anything to it except they wanted to have this rugged mobile DAP business we rolled over on it [ph] and never really went anywhere. ","In TransCore\u2019s case, we have made acquisitions that have been very strategic. Several years ago, we acquired this company called United Toll where United Toll has become the entire technology leadership position around the world on toll traffic with this Infinity Lane Systems, very critical acquisition that we made and it\u2019s kind of fully integrated and gets sold as a bundle. ","Brian Jellison","When you think about MHA, I don't think many things necessarily would be sold as a bundle. SoftWriters can continue to be sold and MHA's product branding would continue to be sold, they\u2019re going to work in an integrated way with one another and in many cases, some of these niche acquisitions will report to the MHA or Sunquest platform business. So that's why we suggested that they were transformational in the way that Neptune and TransCore were transformational, on three and four.","I think we are a little surprised, if somebody would have asked us your next $900 million of deployment would be in one business or six, we would have thought it would be one, but they are so great and so good that we are happy to do those and I think there will be more smaller acquisitions that are closely correlated. Now that said, they\u2019re still all going to be individual niche businesses. We are not going to be the forward rush man to hospital administrator, so a lot of different stuff you pull out of the back.","Jeff Sprague","That makes sense. And the three deals that you did in the quarter, can you give us a sense of the annualized revenue run rate of those? I guess there was some impact in\u2026","Brian Jellison","We think those were going to be up to maybe $100 million of revenue with about 40% EBITDA over the next 12 months.","Jeff Sprague","Okay.","Brian Jellison","And also, we had a huge tax benefit in these deals that are really significant.","Jeff Sprague","And we see those tax benefits in your cash flow, but not your reported tax rate going forward, is that correct?","Brian Jellison","That is absolutely correct. So it's north of $100 million of gross tax benefits that we will recognize over the next 12 to 15 years. So it is a reduction in our cash taxes over that time frame.","Jeff Sprague","And then just one last follow-up, looking at these working capital changes and thinking about John's answer, maybe it was your answer, Brian, about the gross margins in medical, what percent of your business now runs on negative working capital?","Brian Jellison","Not enough, but it\u2019s certainly helpful. We wouldn't have gotten from 14 plus percent to 5 without having several businesses that have negative working capital and most of the acquisitions that we are making now are going to come in with negative working capital. We\u2019re going to get paid in advance for the work that they do, not always, but sometimes they get paid a month in advance, sometimes, they get paid three months in advance, sometimes, they get paid a year in advance on subscription.","John Humphrey","Interesting. So in terms of the negative working capital, so more of the things that we have acquired or looking at are more on the subscription software, so they\u2019re SaaS businesses, which generally don't run with quite as much negative working capital as a license software does, because you have the maintenance that is almost always build a full year in advance, whereas subscription software is going to be built either monthly or quarterly. And so it's not as much around trying to become even more negative as it is continuing to grow those areas that have the high subscription revenue and wonderful balance sheet that comes along with that.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the question-and-answer session for this conference. I\u2019d like to turn the program back over to Mr. Humphrey for any additional or concluding remarks. Sir?","A - John Humphrey","Thanks, Laurie and thanks everyone for joining us with our first quarterly call as Roper Technologies. We look forward to talking to you with our second quarterly call as Roper Technologies as we finish up the second quarter. Thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for joining us."],"18887":["Roper Industries Inc.

I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. ","John Humphrey","Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our fourth quarter and full year.  Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Jason Conley, Head of Planning and Investor Relations for us.  ","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results.  The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call.  In addition, we\u2019ve prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com.","If you\u2019ll turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement.  During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed further in our SEC filings.  You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.","Now if you\u2019ll turn to Slide 3, today we\u2019ll be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a non-GAAP basis.  A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is in our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.  To detail that, for the fourth quarter the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is a fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue at Sunquest.  For the quarter, this impact was $6 million to revenue and operating profit.  This adjustment, to remind everyone, represents revenue that absent our acquisition Sunquest would have recognized.  We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business.","For the full year, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is comprised of three discrete items:  one, the fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue; second, acquisition-related costs specific to Sunquest and the debt extinguishment charge we recorded in the third quarter.  We believe discussing our results excluding these items provides investors with additional insight and improves understanding of the trends of our business.","And now if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  After his prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take questions from our telephone participants.  Brian?","Brian Jellison","","Thank you, John.  Good morning everyone.  So as we look at the Q4 enterprise financial results, it turned out to be the best quarter in our history on virtually every measurement category.  Orders were at the highest level, revenue the highest, net earnings highest, EBITDA, and both operating and free cash flow were all-time records for us.  Revenue was up 10% in the quarter.  Organic growth was 3%, and all four segments really participated in our record fourth quarter.","We ended the year with $953 million in backlog, which is 15% higher than it was this time last year, and our gross margin was really spectacular.  It came in at a remarkable 57.9% for the quarter, which really speaks to the quality of our businesses and their ability to execute.  So gross margin up 300 basis points, above levels that most people never even see.","Our operating margin expanded 300 basis points to 28.3% because operating leverage in the quarter came in at about 57% on new revenue.  Our operating leverage throughout the year has been above 50%, and we\u2019ll talk more about that throughout the discussion this morning.  Remember that we have a lot of non-cash amortization charges in our operating margins.  If you look at them on an EBITDA basis, it would be substantially higher \u2013 another 4 points.","Our EBITDA in the quarter was 275 million.  You might remember at the end of the third quarter we\u2019d said we hoped to hit a run rate in the fourth quarter of a billion dollars or more, and we certainly achieved that.  Our EBITDA margins were up 370 basis points, even higher expansion than our gross margin, and reached 33.7% in the quarter.  Our GAAP operating cash flow was 212 million in the quarter, which represented 26% of revenue, another record for us.  Our diluted earnings per share, even though revenue was up 10, our earnings were up 20% to $1.48, and that brought the full-year earnings to 4.96 a share versus 4.34 last year.  It really was broad-based, as you\u2019ll see this morning.  Next slide?","If you look at the income statement in the quarter, our orders were up 12%.  Organic was up 4.  Our revenue was up 10 and organic was up 3.  For the people who look at book-to-bill relationships, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was a little bit better than the fourth quarter of last year, and we finished the full year \u201912 at a book-to-bill of 1.  Our gross profit was 57.9%, up 300 basis points.  I don\u2019t think anybody would have believed Roper would have achieved a 58% gross margin at this time, but we\u2019ve done that and we think it\u2019s pretty sustainable.  Our operating income was up 23% and our operating margin was up 300 basis points due to that 57% operating leverage in the quarter.  Again, if you add non-cash amortization to that, that number would be another sort of 4 points higher.","Our interest expense was up from 15 to 21 million because we had a successful $900 million bond offering which closed on November 15 in the fourth quarter.  That bond offering set records for execution in terms of spreads on our rating.  There were a number of very favorable things about that bond offering, and of course it sharply reduces the rate at which our interest costs will be coming in in the future.  ","Our tax rate was a little higher in the fourth quarter.  It was 30.1% versus last year\u2019s 29, and that actually cost us $0.02 in the quarter.  You can also think about it in terms of an amortization that if it was $0.02 in the quarter, it would have been $0.08 for the year; so a point of tax reduction for us is worth $0.08 a share, so let\u2019s root for governmental tax reform.  Net earnings, as you can see, up 21% and DEPS up 20%.  Thank you, next slide.","We go to EBITDA growth.  Here you\u2019ll see we closed out the full year at 925 million of EBITDA, which is up 45% just in the last two years; and our EBITDA margins just continue to move up.  You can see they\u2019re up to 30.8% for the full year.  That\u2019s 410 basis points above where they were just two years ago.  Most importantly about this slide is that while our gross margins are already at 30.8%, we\u2019re going to tell you that in 2013 we expect them to expand still further.  Next slide?","Our cash flow performance was 212 million in the fourth quarter, representing 26% of revenue and cash conversion of 147.  On a free cash flow basis, you can see it was 25% of revenue and 141%.  While our cash flow is already best in class, our ratios continue to improve.  As you can see here on the right-hand side of the chart, our free cash flow reached 639 million, up from 471 two years ago; but if you look at the percentage at the bottom, you\u2019ll see that in 2010 our free cash flow to revenue was 19.7% and this year it was 21.3%, up another 160 basis points in just two years.  Next slide?","If you look at our asset velocity performance, there are a couple of very important things about this slide.  Our inventory was actually down at the end of the year at 5.9%.  Payables were about 4.3, by the way, so remember our goals were to always try to get inventory and payables to be close together so that it\u2019s just receivables that are investment around pricing in the way we think about things.  So we closed out the year with inventory plus receivables less payables and accruals at 4.8%, truly a remarkable number.  What\u2019s really interesting and encouraging to us \u2013 you can see in 2010, \u201911 and \u201912 we now have a sustainable level of performance that says we need less than $0.06 of working capital to create a dollar of revenue, and that\u2019s really an exceptional result and sustainable.  Next slide?","If we look at the financial position of the company and the balance sheet, you can see even though we invested over 1.4 billion in 2012, our balance sheet is still in terrific shape.  Cash is slightly higher.  Our undrawn revolver, of course, is much higher and our cash and undrawn revolver powder are up here at 1.771 billion versus 1.088, so after investing over 1.4 billion we\u2019ve still got about 700 million more powder than we did last year.  You can see our trailing 12 months EBITDA at 9.25, when you then do the debt ratios, gross debt to EBITDA is about 2.2 but net debt to EBITDA is only (inaudible).  We\u2019ll generate, we think, well in excess of 700 million in free cash flow in \u201913 to go on top of that, so not impossible to envision us having 2.5 billion to invest soon.  Next slide?","Here we\u2019ll look individually at the various segment details \u2013 next slide.  This is probably the most remarkable slide in the deck in my opinion.  When you think about execution, every one of our segments is doing spectacularly well.  You have four segments and you have four quarters, and you\u2019ll see here we were a perfect 16 for 16 in execution where every segment increased its margin over the prior year in every quarter.  If you look at the industrial technology, you can see revenue for the year was up 8%, operating profit up 15%, and operating margin reached 30% - was up 190 basis points.  If you look at energy systems, here revenue was up 8%, operating profit up 14, and operating profit margin up 140 basis points.  In medical, revenue was up 17%, operating profit up 35%, and OP margin up 380 basis points to 28.1.  And then finally, while revenue was flat in our largest segment in RF, operating profit was up 10% and our operating margin was up 250 basis points.","Lastly on this slide, where you can see really we were up 8%, 8%, 17%, and then flat, the overall company came in up 7% in revenue and up 55% in operating leverage with our largest segment flat for the year, so it speaks really well of the diversity of the things we have going for us in our businesses.  Next slide?","If we look at the energy systems and control segment, you will see in the fourth quarter we were up 7% in revenue and 16% in OP, a remarkable operating profit margin of 33.1%.  Organic revenue was up 6% in the fourth quarter.  Our margin expansion was led primarily by the leverage on growth of the incremental sales and then the benefit of some cost actions that we took in the third quarter in anticipation of some recessionary risks that we might have seen at that time, which have dissipated.","Compressor controls growth was led again by our LNG projects around the world, and certainly an all-time record in the field service activity associated with those products and the aftermarket that they create.  We had a double-digit increase in our alpha technology company, which is really an instrument-based data capturing technology that tire company and latex OEMS use for measuring; and we have very strong seasonal demand in the fourth quarter which we expected to have when we issued guidance.","In the 2013 year as we look ahead, we think compressor controls will continue to generate record levels of revenue with new applications for existing software in the installed base of operations that we\u2019ve enjoyed with our growth recently adds substantially to the customer service profile.  We also have made several bolt-on acquisitions.  We don\u2019t talk a lot about those, but this year alone we acquired a company called Cambridge Instruments which helps our PAC business with online data collection.  We acquired Hao Ying in China, a small sensor company that goes in with our Dynisco product in the Shanghai area; and just on the last day of the year, we acquired another small business that relates to our diesel engine shut-off valve technology.  And those go along with late 2011 acquisitions, United Controls and Trinity Software for compressor controls, so these bolt-ons coupled with organic growth should continue to give us a strong 2013 for energy.  Next slide?","If we look at our industrial technology segment, here you\u2019ll see it was actually down 1% in the fourth quarter, but operating profit was up a couple of points.  We had a favorable benefit due to an accounting thing that happened in the fourth quarter, so the published margins are a little bit better than what we\u2014we\u2019re discounting that as a one-time event, so we\u2019re coming in at operating profit 29.9 versus the GAAP number of 32.7.  ","In the fourth quarter, fluid handling continued to be very strong with our directional drillings operations at Roper Pump.  Everything related to fracking and oil shale was good, except for lower demand for de-watering pumps and basically in the gas arena.  Our Cornell company received a product innovation of the year award for new cutter pump technology that we introduced that breaks up debris and wastewater and reduces clogging, which we think will lead to strong growth for us in that segment.  Our material test business at Struers remained exceptionally strong as it related to consumables, although some of the equipment sales were lower than they were in the prior year.","Neptune is an interesting story in that overall it was flat in the quarter, but that really belies the fact that Neptune had an all-time record year in 2012.  We had very strong distributor growth in the fourth quarter of this year and a little bit of incremental growth out of the Toronto project; but as we said at the end of the third quarter, we had lost one large customer and the impact of that came in the fourth quarter, so that it negated what was actually double-digit revenue growth throughout the country.  We had very exceptional margin performance at nearly 30%, and it really was broad-based throughout the segment.  ","As we look to next year in 2013, the fluid handling oil shale growth will continue.  We have a variety of new products that we continue to add to Roper Pumps\u2019 directional drilling technologies.  We added capacity in 2012 to give us better throughput and faster turnaround at our (inaudible) operation, and in 2013 something that I think no one would have ever expected us to say is we\u2019re actually investing in a new facility in Texas for much larger diameter staters and power sections than we have today due to the growth and prospects for market share gains which are occurring quite rapidly in this segment.","In the second half of the year, we think we\u2019ll get better fluid handling rental market activity that ought to boost Cornell.  We think throughout the year, the other businesses will have sort of low single-digit growth in their industrial end markets; and at Neptune with a little stronger work out of Toronto\u2019s project, an improved housing start here in the U.S., better distribution sales growth should largely offset the customer loss, which will be quite significant in the first half of the year.  Next slide?","In our RF technology segment, here you can see revenue for the quarter was flat but operating profit was up 8% and the OP margin was 27%, which is quite good margin for that segment.  We had very solid execution in creating that margin expansion and most of that came out of better management in the toll and traffic arena.  We\u2019ve really made a number of people changes in that segment and have a new leader who\u2019s been with the company for quite some time.  He\u2019s doing an outstanding job in building a stronger team around execution.","TransCore received an important award for the Doha Airport for both access control and parking control in Doha, and we expect that will generate in the high millions, single-digit millions of dollars for us next year.  TransCore also received a very prestigious award where they won what\u2019s called the International Road Federation Global Achievement Award that was presented by the Chairman of the International Road Federation to the mayor of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.  That was for the work that we did that we don\u2019t talk a lot about in managing New York City traffic lights and traffic systems.  Our ITS project in New York this past year also won an award as the outstanding project in the year.  TransCore won another award for what are called HOV lane activity supports, and that was based really in California where they got the California Transportation Foundation\u2019s 2012 Project of the Year Award.  So our innovation and technological execution continues to be very strong in all these businesses.","Our SAS-based subscriber base in the fourth quarter continued to grow and software margins then expanded as a result, which helped the segment.  In CBORD, which we indicated had won a major university in the northeast, we can now tell you that that actually was Northeastern University; and as you all know, Northeastern has quite a large campus footprint and we\u2019re going to be doing integrated security projects for them for quite some time.  Our bid activity is exceptionally robust at CBORD for 2013.","As we look at next year, our backlog and project pipelines in this segment give us a lot of confidence around pretty good growth in 2013.  Our technolog growth profile should return.  You may remember that technolog is really what\u2019s holding back RF technologies apparent organic growth in 2012 because we had over a $20 million project in France in 2011 which of course wouldn\u2019t repeat into \u201912 and was a headwind of more than $5 million a quarter.  Our software recurring revenue base we think will continue to expand as we get an increasing number of new customers, and we think our margin improvement that you see this year will continue and strengthen in 2013.  Next slide?","If you look at the medical and scientific imaging segment, pretty soon I think we can just call it the medical segment.  This really became the largest segment in the company in the fourth quarter, which is hard to believe, but you had organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter which of course was led by medical.  Our Northern Digital business delivered a record quarter as their OEM system sales for minimally invasive surgical placement hit an all-time high, and then Sunquest we had the benefit of for the full quarter.  Our integration is really very much on track here with Sunquest, and the data now kind of shows you just how strong a company Sunquest is and what kind of performance you get out of it.  We\u2019ll continue, I think, to demonstrate that as you see them in for a full year in 2013.","We also took a charge as we\u2019ve made considerable changes at Verathon to drive faster product introduction and have started to discontinue some efforts around certain engineering initiatives and pare back the rate at which we roll out some of the products that were in their pipeline that we think, while they are interesting, they are not as interesting as other new opportunities we\u2019re focused on.  So we took a $4 million charge in the quarter on inventory and tooling around a product line that we think may do okay but not at the pace that we were prepared to continue to invest in.","As we look at 2013, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re going to get a significant benefit out of a full year of Sunquest contributions.  Our margins, we think are going to continue to expand as Sunquest becomes a larger piece of the mix of this segment, and we think we\u2019ll get operating leverage out of organic growth.  Our medical businesses, we think all have favorable end markets.  We\u2019ve got a number of strategic initiatives that have been put in place under the fellows leading our segment here \u2013 Neil, we brought on in at the end of third quarter of 2011.  We think we\u2019ll finally get a little bit of modest improvement in our research markets that relate to the cameras.  Camera, this year has been a terrific headwind, down about 13% over the prior year, but came in sort of flat in the fourth quarter which is finally a trend we\u2019ve been looking for.  We think it will actually have positive growth on a modest level in 2013.  Next slide?","If you look at our 2013 guidance \u2013 next slide \u2013 we establish guidance for the full year at 560 to 582, so that gives you a midpoint of 571 versus 496 this year at the midpoint.  We\u2019d be up 15.1% on a net earnings basis.  We\u2019re projecting revenuer growth of 8 to 10%.  We think organic ought to be up 3 to 5.  We think organic in the first half of the year will be quite modest, particular stress on Q1.  We think we\u2019ll be up in the high single digits organic growth rate in the third and fourth quarter.  ","Foreign exchange, we\u2019re just assuming the 12\/31 rates would continue.  Tax rate, a little higher next year at 31%.  Diluted share count, we think will come in at about 100.5 million shares, and then if you look at our Q1 guidance we\u2019re saying $1.19 to $1.23.  Full-year operating cash flow, we think will exceed 775 million \u2013 that\u2019s up about 100 million from what we just delivered here this past year.  ","I think what\u2019s really important is that if you look at the power of our cash-on-cash return models now as they start to really compound, that 775 million for 2013, when we look out in the next three years \u2013 \u201913, \u201914 and \u201915 \u2013 we would expect to generate over 2.5 billion in operating cash flow, and that gives us of course an incredible amount of flexibility for investing in these businesses.  Next slide?","If you look at the summary then for 2012, you can see that we achieved really all-time record results.  Total revenue was up 7% for the year even though our largest segment had no revenue increase; organic revenue up 4%, our gross margin up 180 basis points to 56% for the year, operating margin was up 220 basis points to 25.8% on operating leverage that exceeded 50% on the next dollar of revenue.  Our non-cash amortization for 2012 was $117 million, which really understates the quality of our operating earnings; so if you add the non-cash amortization back into the operating margin or the interest before tax, if you will, you get an EBITDA ratio of 29.6%.  ","Our EBITDA was 125 million up over the prior year, and our EBITDA margins for the full-year were at 30.8%.  We\u2019ve already told you we expect those to expand in 2013.  Our CAPEX for the year was 38 million, which is exactly the same as depreciation; and when we talk about EBITDA, we really need to get Roper to distinguish the awareness around other people\u2019s EBITDA has a lot of D and a lot of CAPEX it needs to offset it.  Ours simply doesn\u2019t.  This is really all EBIT-A with just 38 million of D and 38 million of offsetting CAPEX.","Operating cash flow for the full-year at 678 million represented 23% of revenue, and we hope to add over 100 million to that for this year.  We invested over a 1.4 billion in acquisitions.  Our deal pipeline now is as exciting as ever.  We expect to capture additional opportunities in 2013 and we\u2019ve already got over 1.5 billion of powder before we add another 700 million to that as the year progresses.","So with that, we\u2019d like to open it up to questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  We will now go to our question and answer portion of the call.  [Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll take our first question from Dean Dray with Citi Research.  ","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Research","","Thank you.  Good morning everyone.  On the medical side, you were flat on organic revenue growth.  Did you see any pull-in from some of the year-end business getting pulled in, maybe related to the pending tax increase or any budget flush?","Brian Jellison","No, we really didn\u2019t see that at all, and most of our stuff is kind of going direct so it\u2019s not a like a distributor pull-in with standard products that some other people might have.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Research","And then Brian, when you talk about the acquisition capacity approaching 2.5 billion, for the medical side are you more apt to pursue adjacencies, new products, new platforms in SAS like you\u2019ve done in Sunquest, or would you be looking more in the device side like Verathon, Northern Digital, where you can drop a product line into your sales force?","Brian Jellison","","Well, we would and are doing both.  You just never know what you\u2019re able to negotiate in terms of what\u2019s the best use of funds.  So we\u2019re always really looking at the asset velocity of things, so the software businesses have an easier hurdle because they always have less assets.  If their product businesses are such that we think they\u2019re well positioned and have great defense mechanisms, we\u2019re not opposed to adding to that.  ","As a general rule, there certainly are some product transactions we\u2019re looking at now, but most of the things we\u2019re looking at are related to software and service opportunities.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great, that\u2019s helpful.  Just one last one if I could \u2013 on the Neptune customer loss, give us some perspective, was this on pricing?  Is it a market share shift?  You said that there would be some impact in the next couple quarters.","Brian Jellison","Yeah, it\u2019s a very large customer who has decided that they want to go to take the risk associated with the composite meters.  We don\u2019t think it says anything other than they\u2019re going to try something else.  We had a long-term contract with them that\u2014and they had a change in management, and we\u2019ll see how it works out.  It will have an effect on the first half of this year from a revenue viewpoint.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s indicative of anything; in fact, we were up nearly 20% in (inaudible) sales in the fourth quarter, so you can\u2019t see it.  We wound up being flat because you got one large customer that\u2019s down.","John, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to Dean\u2019s question around the customer situation?  I think it\u2019s a one-off thing that\u2014","John Humphrey","","Yeah, I\u2019d agree with that.","Brian Jellison","It sort of supply chain people making the decision instead of operating people.  I know the operating people aren\u2019t happy about it.","John Humphrey","And it\u2019s one of those things that\u2014I mean, it\u2019s important in terms of Neptune, but once it gets to the Roper level, it really gets not as material, for sure.  It will be an impact for the first quarter and the first half.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Research Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Research","","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Summerville with Keybanc.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","Morning.  Just a couple questions.  Brian, can you talk a little bit about later in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, the kind of order dynamics you\u2019re seeing in your shorter cycle businesses like Dynisco, and you mentioned Struer equipment sales down.  Has that trend changed?","Brian Jellison","Well, what\u2019s important about the fourth quarter \u2013 it\u2019s a great question, Matt \u2013 is we have three businesses:  Dynisco, which is always supplying things which frequently have to do with capacity utilization; Struer, which is somewhat similar to that in terms of their consumables; and then our core AMOT business.  Those three were leading indicators for us in Q4 of 2008 when you went into the \u201909 downturn, so we\u2019re looking at those things weekly. ","In the fourth quarter, they did better than the concern level you would have had, so we haven\u2019t really seen anything in those businesses yet that would indicate that there\u2019s any forward indicator; and in fact, December shipments were stronger for the businesses than October and November, which resulted in us having a little bit more receivables at the end of the year than we would have liked to have had, but you know, it\u2019s the year-end stuff that happens frequently.  ","So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that makes us nervous, and in the case of the equipment it wasn\u2019t core equipment that we provide out of Struers for cutting technology.  We have a line of hardness testers that we sell, and they were off in the fourth quarter.  Fortunately they\u2019re lower margin products, so it wasn\u2019t overly material, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping our eye on.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","And then just one follow-up \u2013 can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing out of Sunquest in terms of pro forma organic revenue growth versus your expectation going into the deal?","John Humphrey","Sure.  I mean, they continue to do extremely well.  We\u2019re seeing high single digit organic growth out of that business, and we would expect to see that continue into 2013 also.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","Thanks Brian.  Thanks John.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Good morning gentlemen.  Looking at your expectations of expanded EBITDA margins in 2013, can you help break down a little bit how much you expect in gross margin improvement versus operating expense growth?  It seems like a lot of\u2014I think certainly some of it is going to come from Sunquest, but if you can break that down, it\u2019d be helpful.","John Humphrey","You know, I\u2019m going to need to follow up with you on that.  We do expect to see gross margin expansion along with operating margin expansion, both because our faster growing businesses are also our higher margin businesses on the software side as well as on medical and the impact from Sunquest.  So probably not quite as much on gross margin as we\u2019re expecting on EBITDA margin, but both of them we expect to be up in \u201913.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay.  And then on Neptune again, Brian, it\u2019s still been a pretty strong couple of years.  Is there any ramp-down in sales and projects outside of the one that you lost, and what are expectations for the industry, and then with Neptune relative to the industry in 2013?  And do you expect more people to go\u2014maybe even shift to the composite?","Brian Jellison","Well, I think as far as the situation is, you\u2019re going to get\u2014we would get a disproportionate amount of new meters associated with housing starts, so as housing starts are picking up, so are our sales through distribution in the U.S. water market.  So we expect pretty decent growth there, certainly high single digits, maybe more; and so other people who have lower shares than we do are likely to get some corresponding benefit in their business.  I think it\u2019s a generally favorable or more favorable market than it has been for replacement water meters and for just installs for (inaudible).  When it comes to the rest of the world, that\u2019s an entirely different story and our products really don\u2019t play in anything other than the high pressure water market.","Composite meters, nobody\u2019s had great success with those over time.  We don\u2019t see any shifts to that at all except in people who come in who don\u2019t know the industry, don\u2019t know the products, and think everything is uniform because they\u2019re SAP people.  They can do things that will be proven to be a mistake later, and so we\u2019re not really bothered by that.  It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve lost a customer only to get them back a little bit later when they realize that value is more important than price.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks, good morning.  Brian, just apparent liquidity notwithstanding, wondering how you\u2019re looking at the short to long-term acquisition pipeline, how you\u2019re thinking about the range of scale and breadth, and if you see any scenario where a modest share issuance would be appropriate or warranted.","Brian Jellison","Well, I think we\u2019re pretty reluctant to want to issue any equity.  I really just don\u2019t see the need for that.  The reason that we do acquisitions is because we have great free cash flow, and when you lever that at, say, three times debt to EBITDA the acquired company, you can really make a material difference in your growth rate and kind of in the perpetuity growth rate of the enterprise, and that\u2019s what we do.  We just think that\u2019s the best way to create shareholder value.","If we wanted to increase\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t know why we\u2019d issue equity unless it was just the most incredible, spectacular thing of all time, and we did that in December of 2003 when we acquired Neptune and didn\u2019t have really a high quality public company balance sheet.  We did it again in December of 2004 when we acquired Neptune.  Those acquisitions represented four times trailing EBITDA of the company, for heaven\u2019s sakes, in terms of what we had to do.  You know, with trailing EBITDA with a run rate well in excess of a billion, we\u2019re not planning on a $4 billion deal tomorrow at noon.  So I think we can be quite satisfied with 1.5 billion-plus a year in acquisition growth, so I don\u2019t think we would issue equity.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks.  And then the other one would be let\u2019s go a little bit more into the bridge from the current orders rates to the EPS target for next year \u2013 very strong, but had some backlog runoff in the second half.  We\u2019ve gotten some color, but if we could just dive into any more qualitative around that.","John Humphrey","Sure.  I think as we went through our\u2014not only the planning activity that we always do but also the fourth quarter operating reviews that we go through with each of our businesses, we look not only at what they actually did in the fourth quarter but their projections for the first quarter and the rest of the year, and what\u2019s in their backlog, what\u2019s in their pipeline of opportunities.  As we went through that, we saw a number of things, both on the new product introduction side but also on the projects that are currently being bid and currently in front of us, not yet in backlog, that give us confidence that the second half of the year we\u2019ll see a higher organic growth rate than what we\u2019re going to see in the first half of the year.  But I think that that\u2019s going to be weighted more toward\u2014well, probably RF will be a little bit stronger than industrial for the full year basis, but overall we expect to see full-year organic growth in all four of our segments.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Great.  Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yes.  Brian, just a couple questions.  In the energy systems business, the book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was maybe a little bit softer than we typically see seasonally.  Has anything, again, maybe slowed there or is that just a comparison issue?  And then within that, the compressor controls, the acquisitions you made, the smaller ones, it sounds like they\u2019re bringing software into compressor controls.  Is that the right way to think about that?  I mean, are these companies bringing customers or are they bringing code?  What are these small acquisitions\u2014how do they expand the business?","Brian Jellison","Well, I\u2019ll take the latter and then we\u2019ll shift back to the nature of the orders.  Each one of them is a little different, but United Controls brought with it a very significant engine manufacturer that we were not doing business with, and so that gave us a customer benefit.  It also gave us some application engineering capability with that business that supports what we do, so that was good.  It also gave us some improved regional activity in some parts of the world.","Trinity Software was an entirely different concept where it had some breakthrough code, to use your term.  It really has breakthrough technology that\u2019s in its infancy.  It\u2019s going to be in maybe high single digit millions, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that can move up quite dramatically over the next three years, so we\u2019re investing a lot of time in bringing our business processes to that group of people.","Cambridge is not in compressor controls.  It\u2019s in petroleum analyzer, and we have some, if not the best equipment in the world in analyzing different things for refineries, but we don\u2019t have a lot of online capability and Cambridge brings us an opportunity to have online capability in software.  So that\u2019s an important growth venue for us.","Now on the order flow and seasonality of fourth quarter, John, why don\u2019t you take that?","John Humphrey","Yeah, sure.  In terms of the fourth quarter orders for energy, they were actually in line with what we had expected.  What we\u2019re seeing, of course, is with many of the projects that compressor controls has already completed and now it\u2019s moving into field service, it changes the timing of those orders.  It\u2019s more of a book-and-ship, or a book and then maybe ship two or three months later when you recognize the revenue associated with field service, as opposed to their larger projects which oftentimes would\u2014distort is probably not the right word, but would affect the book-to-bill ratio in fourth quarters of prior years.  The other areas that we normally look for and did see seasonal benefits, both on the instrument side for Alpha Technologies and also on our petroleum analyzer business \u2013 once again, providing software algorithms and testing solutions for refineries \u2013 we did see a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter, but that was both on revenue and orders so that seasonal uptick really didn\u2019t change the book-to-bill ratio very much.  ","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, I understand.  And then just a last question \u2013 in the RF tech business, we talked about some pretty nice wins on the tolling and CBORD side.  This RF tech is always a little difficult to model out given the timing and the size of these projects, but when you think about \u201913 and project out \u201913 in your forecast, can RF tech have a double-digit growth year for \u201913?","John Humphrey","It can.  I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s embedded in our guidance, though.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, can but we shouldn\u2019t time this out to the point where we\u2019ll get a\u2014","John Humphrey","Yeah, our expectation with respect to 3 to 5% organic growth for the year, like I said, it\u2019s a little bit more heavily weighted.  RF may be above that, but we\u2019re not ready to say that\u2019s going to be double-digit yet.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, fair enough.  Thank you.","Brian Jellison","Although for our internal people listening, we expect you to move along those lines!","","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","With better margin, huh?  Great, thank you.","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Good morning.  I\u2019d like to address the guidance that you announced as you set a 15.1% increase over last year, and if you adjust for the higher tax rate, it\u2019s about 17.5% increase.  But that\u2019s less than the company\u2019s long-term average growth, the 20%.  I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful \u2013 17.5% is still pretty good.  It seems that some of that is in the first quarter because that guidance is only up 11% from last year.  Are you being too conservative here on looking at a weak economy?  Just exactly what are the assumptions behind the guidance, because it isn\u2019t as strong as, for example, you did in 2012.  Is it possible that you\u2019re getting so big or your margins are getting so high that you can\u2019t get the same percentage increase in margins relative to the increase in sales that you\u2019ve gotten in the past?  Could you address all that?","John Humphrey","Alex, I think one of the factors when you\u2019re looking at our previous years\u2019 growth rates, of course those always include not only what we do on an organic basis but also the effect of acquisitions; and our guidance for 2013, as it always does, excludes any acquisitions that we have not yet completed.  So I think that is probably going to be one of the differences you see between our guidance and the actuals as they roll in, Sunquest being an example of that \u2013 of course, that added both accretive earnings but more importantly accretive cash flow to us for 2012.  We would expect future acquisitions, although they\u2019re never in our guidance, to be accretive from a cash basis also.  Whether they are accretive on an earnings basis is always going to be dependent upon the accounting ramifications of amortization and other things.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Right.  Well yes, and when they come in the year.","John Humphrey ","","That\u2019s also true.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","It\u2019s possible you could have accretive acquisitions that really wouldn\u2019t add to 2013 if they came late in the year.","John Humphrey","That is true.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","But could you address your economic assumptions and why the first quarter is only up 11%?  Because that would not include\u2014I mean, that wouldn\u2019t be because you haven\u2019t added in acquisitions to the first quarter guidance, because you don\u2019t have time to\u2014","John Humphrey","That is correct.  That is correct, so kind of as we talked about a little bit earlier, we do expect the organic sales growth to be higher in the second half based upon what we\u2019re seeing from a project pipeline and execution of our existing backlog relative to the first quarter.  We also have in the first half a little bit of headwind associated with the Neptune customer that decided not to renew with us.  So those are some of the things that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 a little bit tougher comp against last year where we had 8% organic growth in the first quarter of last year.  It\u2019s a little bit of a tougher comp versus what we see for Q2, Q3 and Q4 as we go forward.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay.  Then a follow-up \u2013 why is the tax rate up?","John Humphrey","Well, Sunquest as a U.S.-based company generates most of their earnings in the United States, which is the highest tax rate in the world, and so those earnings come in at a marginal tax rate of probably 38 to 39%.  And then just other normal tax planning activities, which is probably the\u2014which is definitely the smaller portion of the increase that we expect for \u201913.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yeah, we definitely need corporate tax reform.  Thanks.","John Humphrey","I wouldn\u2019t say protection; I\u2019d just say a level playing field.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session for this call.  I will now turn the call back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Okay.  Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to talking to you as we finish our first quarter.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.  We appreciate your participation.  You may now disconnect."],"19191":["Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Zack Moxcey - IR","Neil Hunn - President and CEO","Rob Crisci - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets","Robert McCarthy - Stephens","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Joe Giordano - Cowen and Company","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. I'll remind you that today's call is being recorded. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey.","Zack Moxcey","Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies.","Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now if you'll please turn to slide two. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue, transaction related expenses for the foundry acquisition and lastly and adjustment to the income tax expense related to the gain on sale of our Scientific Imaging businesses.","And now if you will please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone.","As usual, we'll start with our second quarter highlights. I'll then turn our call over to Rob to discuss our financial results. I'll then walk us through the segment details and outlook, followed by our Q3 in 2019 guidance, then we'll open it up for Q&A. Next slide.","We had another very strong quarter here at Roper. Revenue grew as expected, margin execution was strong and operating cash flow increased 13%. It was nice to see gross margins expand 90 basis points in the quarter increasing in both of our product segments. And we always like to see leverage down the P&L with EBITDA growing faster than revenue and cash flow outpacing that of EBITDA.","Our software segments continued their strong momentum led by 6% organic growth and our network systems and software segment which saw broad based growth highlighted by DAT, iTrade, MHA and SoftWriters.","Application software grew 2% despite a difficult comp against Deltek significant perpetual wins a year ago. Deltek continues to win in the marketplace with bookings up double-digits and SaaS adoption accelerating in the quarter.","Growth in our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment was led by high-single-digit growth in our medical product businesses as new products gain traction following recent investments. And Neptune strategic concepts continued with another solid quarter of growth.","However, this was partially offset by expected decline to contain and a short cycle pause late in the quarter for industrial businesses, which represents approximately 8% of our annual revenues. We will discuss this later in the call, but we're maintaining a cautious stand and not assuming investment improvement in the second half of the year.","Process technologies continues to do an impressive job executing through expected declines in oil and gas market.","As many of you know, we closed the Foundry transaction in the quarter and onboarded the company into operating and governance model or very early things are off to a good start.","And finally, our acquisition pipeline is quite active, and our balance sheet positions are exceptionally well to deploy capital in the second half.","I'll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated quarter results, Rob.","Rob Crisci","Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everybody.","Turning to page six, I would like to recap some of the numbers behind our strong second quarter financial performance, starting with revenue, revenue was 1.332 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% and organic increase of 2%. This was right online as Neil mentioned with our internal guidance model coming into the quarter.","We had organic growth in three of the four segments, the one thing that was down was our process technology segment as expected against the very difficult plus 20% comp last year.","Margin expansion was very strong, so gross margins increased 90 basis points to 64%, EBITDA increased 5%, EBITDA margin up 70 basis point. So, really good margin expansion for the quarter, probably a little bit better than we had anticipated coming in. So that all adds up to DEPS for the quarter of $3.07, which was a 6% increase over last year and a little bit better than our guidance coming in as $3 to $3.04. Next slide.","Turning to asset-light business model slide. We will look here the net working capital as a percent of the Q2 annualized revenue, so slightly different view this quarter. Looking back over the past six years of the trend to give a little bit of a perspective and what's been going on with working capital here for Roper over a long period of time.","So, if you look back and compare June 2013 quarter to the June 2019 quarter, you will see our inventory is down 200 basis points to 4.3% of revenue. Receivables are down 240 basis points to 17.3% of revenue, payables down a little bit to 10.5%, but deferred revenue up 680 basis points to 13.5% and if you add all that together you see this consistent negative working capital we talked about at Roper at minus 2.4% for the quarter and that over a thousand basis point improvement versus the same period in 2013.","So, we really believe the negative net working capital accelerates our cash flow compounding. Next slide.","Speaking of cash flow compounding, excellent cash results in the quarter on page eight, Q2 operating cash flow of 301 million now is at 30% increase versus prior year, the free cash flow was 286 million which represented a 14% increase versus prior year.","So, if we look now at the trailing 12 month 1.51 billion, certainly a record plus 23% over prior year 12-month period and representing importantly 28% of revenue. If you look at the first half of the year, we are up 15% on cash flow that were certainly on pace for continued double-digit compounding at Roper. Next slide.","So importantly, due to the strong cash flow performance, we really see exceptional deleveraging over the past year, so in between acquisitions, we generate a lot of cash, we paid our debt very, very quickly that we're always well-positioned to make the next acquisition and deploy capital.","So, if you look at the past year, gross debt down $900 million from 5.6 billion down to 4.7 billion, Net debt is down 800 million from 5.2 billion to 4.4 billion. The TTM EBITDA is up $191 million and you can see year gross debt to EBITDA is now down to 2.5 times, net debt to EBITDA is was down 2.3 times.","We recently were upgraded at Moody's which we're very happy to see, we also have a BBB plus rating at S&P. So, we really are exceptionally well-positioned as we sit here today to continue our disciplined capital deployment and really take advantage of the of the very high-quality pipeline and acquisition opportunities that we have in front of us.","So, with that, I will turn it back over to Neil.","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Rob.","Let's go and turn to our application software segment. In the quarter, the segment represented 29% of our revenue and revenues came in at 391 million, which was plus to organic and EBITDA was 155 million, which represented 39.7% margin.","Starting with Deltek, we saw a continuation of a few trends that we've discussed over the past several quarters.","First, we saw an acceleration in bookings and recurring revenues as a result of an increased mix of business towards Deltek SaaS offerings. In fact, in the quarter, Deltek signed their largest Vantagepoint's SaaS contract. As a reminder, Vantagepoint is Deltek's new enterprise software offering targeting professionals service firms.","Also, the business continues to see a nice balance of activity across their two macro end markets, professional services and government contract. To remind you, Deltek had a very difficult comp given a very large volume of perpetual deal signed a year ago. Adjusting for this, Deltek grew their bookings double digits in the quarter. Deltek team continues to execute exceptionally well.","Aderant experienced double-digit growth, as a result of continued share gains in the adoption of their newer staff solutions targeting law firm. As you may note, we've highlighted Aderant\u2019s competitive strength over the last several quarters.","Over that period of time and since 2015, Aderant has added approximately 40,000 timekeepers to their core platform, roughly 30,000 of which have been competitively won from their largest competitor, Deane and her team at Aderant have done and continue to do a great job.","At PowerPlan, we saw nice increases in recurring revenues based on continued strong retention rates and an expanding customer base. Importantly, the PowerPlan team is working aggressively and systematically to increase the volume of new pipeline ads and their sales funnel. This is particularly important following the regulatory driven increase and license implementation revenues following the new lease accounting standards.","Also, we saw nice increases again at CBORD with excellent cash performance. As a reminder, CBORD is our software business that delivers integrated security and payment solutions to higher education and health care campuses.","Finally, Strata log another great quarter based on very strong renewal activity, the adoption of their new products and continued market share gains for their cost accounting and Decision Support SaaS products for hospital market.","As we turn to the outlook for the second half, we continue to expect 4% to 6% organic increases for the segment. The comps for Deltek will normalize in the second half and we expect the segment's organic growth to be slightly better in Q4 versus that of Q3. Next slide.","And turning to our Network System, Software & Systems segment. This segment in the quarter revenue represented 28% of Roper\u2019s revenue and revenue was $368 million which was plus 6% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $159 million, which represented a margin of 43.2%.","The quarter was highlighted by continued growth at both of our freight match businesses, the U.S. and Canadian markets. In particular, we saw strength and demand for our rates data offering.","MHA\u2019s performance in the quarter was highlighted by several strong trends. To remind everyone, MHA is the largest group purchasing network for the non-hospital market, with leadership position and long-term care of pharmacy, long-term care of facilities and home infusion marketplaces. The team continues to win the market share gain relative to on-boarding new and started pharmacies. So, nothing new here, and a good job by the go-to market team.","Importantly in the quarter, MHA started to see the benefits of increased customer purchasing volumes due to several new pharmaceutical products being on contract. Also, pricing appears just stabilize and the businesses food and nutrition portfolio grew nicely into quarter in the mid-single-digit range.","Additionally, our Pharmacy Automation and Workflow Software business, SoftWriters had a very nice quarter continuing a trend. This is an example of a wonderful software business with network effects and network financial benefits.","This is a business that develops and deploys the core pharmacy automation workflow software that closed door or non-retail pharmacies use in their day-to-day operations. The economics of this business and for our customers are unlocked as they cross-sell the recurring revenue transactional products, specifically electronic claims submission and e-prescription.","So, as this business adds more and more pharmacies to the customer accounts, their economic model expands at a more rapid pace as the recurring revenues accelerate. Nice job by the team in Pittsburgh.","iTrade grew high single digits in the quarter based on strong renewal activity and an increase in trading partner growth. Over the last couple of years, the team at iTrade has worked to structure their business model and customer contracts or iTrade benefits from volume increases from their trading partners and we saw the benefits of this in the most recent quarter.","Again, we saw strength at RF Ideas, in fact a record quarter for the business. The strength is based on continued adoption of RF Ideas core reader technology in the secure print and secure sign-on marketplaces.","At TransCore, the quarter is marked by an exciting new product release. TransCore\u2019s proprietary integrated toll technology and partnership with Gentex was released in rearview mirrors and Audi's new electric SUV. Currently other OEMs are evaluating the technology and considering timetable for a potential adoption, or very early this is another example of great innovation by Roper business.","And before we return to the outlook for the segment, we wanted to briefly discuss our most recent acquisition, Foundry. We closed the transaction during the second quarter. Soon after, we had the opportunity to onboard the team and do our normal introduction to our governance model and CRI framework.","Also, we're excited to announce that Jody Madden, previously Foundry\u2019s Head of Product was named as our CEO. Jody is perfectly suited for this role, given her long history in the visual effects industry, as well as her specific history with Foundry.","So far, it has been a very easy transition. Importantly, Jody was able to successfully close a couple of very large planned transactions with customer prospects in early days of our new leadership role. Congrats to Jody and welcome to the entire Foundry team.","Now turning to our outlook. For the second half, we continue to see 4% to 6% organic growth for this segment. Role of TransCore, the new project pipeline remains robust, although it's difficult as usual to forecast the timing of new project wins and implementation timetable. Next slide.","Our Measurement and Analytical Systems segment in the quarter represented 31% of Roper\u2019s revenue. Revenue for the segment was $408 million which is plus 2% on an organic basis, and EBITDA came in at $140 million, which represented a 34.3% margin.","Neptune had another record quarter. Neptune strategy is rooted in customer intimacy and product innovation continues to help Neptune systematically gain market share in the North American market.","NDI had another great quarter. This quarter strength is rooted in NDI's electromagnetic and optical measurement systems used by several OEMs in surgical applications. Dave and his team in Waterloo continue to do a terrific job.","Verathon Growth was led by increases in our glide scope consumables recurring revenue and demand for the next generation bladder scan systems.","The Roper Board of Directors is looking forward to a site visit at Verathon during the upcoming September board meeting and seeing all the progress the company has made for the past couple years.","Our CIVCO MMI our Multi-Modality Imaging business located in Iowa City had a very nice quarter that was highlighted by strong execution in their ultrasound guidance and infection control markets. CIVCO's ultrasound guidance products have extremely high levels of intellectual property and meaningfully aid doctors and ultrasound assisted procedures.","Our particular interest is CIVCO's most recent innovation regarding infection control. For many years, CIVCO has been a market leader in providing covers for ultrasound assisted surgical procedures, namely image guided biopsies.","One of the risk factors of these procedures is the risk of cross contamination of the gel that is used for ultrasound conductivity. Well, the smart team at CIVCO appears to have solved this problem. They created the first ever an IP protected solution that does not require gel in ultrasound guided procedures.","The team is just launching the product in North American and Europe, and congrats to the team on its innovation. And we look forward to working with the team to make this become the standard of care.","Our industrial businesses, which are about 25% of this segment\u2019s revenues are impacted by a short cycle pause late in the quarter and down mid-single digits. Strewers [ph] really all of over industrial businesses from a slowdown in the second half of the quarter, due to project push outs and consumable destocking.","As such, bookings for this group were down high single digits in the quarter. Importantly, this group did a very nice job managing margins and cash flow in the quarter.","Gatan declined in the quarter as we expected. And as we have announced, the agreement to sell the Thermo has been terminated over regulatory concerns.","As we turn to the guidance for the second half, we see organic revenues increasing 1% to 3% for the segment. Our medical products and Neptune businesses which are roughly 70% of the segments revenues are expected to increase mid-single digit plus for the balance of the year.","For a shorter cycle industrial business again 25% of the segments revenues. We expect these businesses to be down high single digits for the second half of the year. This assumes the late second quarter industrial slowdown continues for the balance of the year.","And for Gatan and given the Gatan sale of Thermo was terminated in the quarter. We have now included Gatan in our full year and second half guidance. Specifically, we\u2019ve added approximately $0.20 of DEPS to the second half. Also, we expect to be modest organic decline for Gatan given the record 2018 comps.","Finally, we have reengaged a sale process for Gatan. While early in the relaunch process we received strong interest from many parties. Gatan is a very good business with an exceptional management team. We\u2019re committed to completing the sale process with Gatan but if we do not receive compelling economic and contractual offers, we look forward to owning Gatan over the long-term, engaging with Saunders [ph] and his team and investing for its long-term success. Next page.","As we turn to our process technology segments in the quarter, the segment represented 12% of Roper's revenue, revenue was a $164 million which was down 5% on organic basis. EBITDA was $60 million, which represented an amazing 36.6% margin.","Our upstream oil and gas businesses declined as expected against a very challenging comp which was plus 20% from a year ago. That said, the business has executed very nimbly in the quarter and drove outstanding margins across the segment. EBITDA margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter.","Role of CCC, we continue to see strength into our LNG product pipeline. Finally, Metrix delivered a record quarter based on strong demand for their vibration monitoring systems and controls across multiple end markets.","Turning to the outlook. We see minus 1% to 3% organic growth for the segment for the balance of the year and do see easing comps in Q4 versus Q3. As we have discussed, the potential for upside may exist based on expanded takeaway capacity and or higher oil prices, but we have not assumed this is going to happen in our outlook for the second half.","Now let\u2019s turn to our guidance update. We\u2019re updating our DEPS guidance to a range of $12.94 to $13.06 compared to our prior guidance of $12.70 to $13. This increase to our guidance range primarily relate to the inclusion of Gatan, which we expect to add approximately $0.207 to second half DEPS. Given the dynamics around the divestiture process, we do expect there to be greater than a normal variability in Gatan\u2019s second half results.","Our DEPS and organic growth guidance assume that the short cycle industrial pause that we saw late in the second half continues for the remainder of the year. while recent trends may just be a soft patch, we do not have visibility into the second half recovery for our industrial businesses. And more importantly, we do not want our business leaders to assume a bounce back occurs.","Accordingly, we are lowering our revenue assumptions for those businesses and expect our industrial business leaders to focus on continuing to deliver high margin and strong cash flow.","Should industrial trends improve, our guidance for those businesses could prove conservative. As it should be clear from the content of our remarks on this call, the vast majority approximately 80% of our enterprise continues to have strong momentum, growing roughly 5% on an organic basis.","Rolled up to our tax rate, we assume the rates for the second half to be approximately 21%. And finally, we\u2019re establishing our Q3 adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of 3.16 to 3.20.","Now let\u2019s turn to the Q2 summary. We saw great execution and cash performance across the enterprise. EBITDA increased 5%, margins expanded, and free cash flow grew 14% in the quarter.","Importantly, our CRI discipline improvement business models continue to provide a scale platform for long term to systematic growth.","Now turning to capital deployment. First and as the primary source for our capital deployment funding, our excellent cash performance will continue. With leverage approaching two times trailing EBITDA, our balance sheet is very well-positioned to be offensive.","Through the extent we\u2019re able to successfully complete the sale of Gatan, we will be even better position to accelerate our cash flow compound, also it is nice to see the Moody\u2019s upgrade, the BAA2 and a sustained S&P BBB plus ratings for a bond.","Rolled to the outlook for acquisitions and our pipeline commentary, we continue to see a very large number of very high-quality assets. We\u2019ll always remain patient, but we are very active in maturing a number of opportunities in the pipeline.","Importantly, it\u2019s always good to remind everyone that our CRI orientation and M&A processes help us identify and execute on the very best acquisition ideas.","Now as we turn to questions, I want to remind everyone that we do is very simple. We compound cash flow. By running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market leading position and niche industry. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management teams based on growth.","We have a culture of mutual trust and transparency and finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company. These simple ideas deliver powerful results.","Now let's go and turn it over to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And now we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the call. [Operator Instructions] And moving first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Deane.","Rob Crisci","Good morning.","Deane Dray","I don't normally have the opportunity or the responsibility of asking you about short cycle industrial softness in the quarter is just, it's not typically something that we're talking about, but it's presenting itself here.","So, can you provide some more color on the, kind of the cadence in the quarter the push out some of the destocking? And what visibility do you have? And if you can get it by business that might give us some context? And start there, please?","Neil Hunn","I'll appreciate the question. I'll give you some thoughts and ask Rob, if he has any additional. So, its first say, we got to note that we're, it's 8% of our business, it's 6 or 7 businesses over 45 that we're talking about. And we're maybe not the best read across to other things. But I'll tell you what we saw. So, April was just fine. Really no issues there. May saw a little bit of weakness and June saw a lot of weakness.","Interestingly, it was across really all of the industrial businesses that we have, it was across geographies Europe might have been a little bit weaker than North America, but nothing discernible. And really, across different various end market it was an isolated to one end market. What we think, what we saw also was projects push, and then a bit of consumable or spare sort of destocking, right. So, it's really across both the capital piece and the recurring piece.","Interesting, the first three weeks or so in July, we saw a pretty meaningful recovery. But we don't yet know enough, if that's just a bounce back from June or if it's -- or what the real root cause was, for a while we saw the declination across the quarter. It was window dressing for the quarter or if it was something around trade, tensions or something -- some folks waiting for lower interest rates, we don't yet know the root cause.","And so, it's just a little too early for us to call a specific direction. So, we chose to be what we think is relatively concerted here. So, we saw down mid-single to the second quarter, our assumption is down high singles for the balance of the year.","And we're managing the businesses assuming that that occurs, right. We don't want our leaders in these businesses to get sort of caught assuming a recovery and then it doesn't happen, then you have a margin problem. So, that's a bit of the color. And if Rob if you want to add any additional.","Rob Crisci","Yes. Sure. So just a clearly sighs that as Neil mentioned that 8% of the company's revenue about 25% of that segment. So, this is not included in Neptune. Neptune continues to grow, it exactly the same sort of mid-single digit plus, it's just the businesses that Neil mentioned.","So, the bookings were down sort of high-single-digits. And therefore, we're assuming the second half of the year is high-single-digit declines where we used to have flat, so it's about 25 million of revenue that comes out of the second half. That's really the only sort of change in the entire company and what we're seeing at this point versus three months ago,","Deane Dray","It's helpful. And if I'm looking to calibrate how the slowing on the organic side ripples through into your guidance. Just to make sure, I've got the right pieces here. Gatan adding back $0.20, it looks like the tax rate a bit lower is adding $0.08 versus our estimate. So then when I look at the midpoint raise, it does look like there is a second half lower operating guidance. It's something in the high teens sense if that's right and maybe try some context there.","Rob Crisci","So, the tax rate is slightly lower that\u2019s offset by higher share count, little bit higher interest, we are losing some proceeds from Gatan that impact to interest. So, those other things sort of cancel each other out is really around $0.10 on industrial is the big change.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. Just last one for me on Gatan, was there any loss of momentum in the sales process. You mentioned some slowing, but it sounds like those were tough comps, but is there any momentum loss in the business as it's brought back into Roper?","Neil Hunn","So, the team at Gatan really should be applauded for how well they executed and performed over what has been a really long drawn out 18 months, 12 to 18 months process here, The business performed amazingly well last year with sort of new product cycle and as expect with Gatan, it sort of drive up a new product cycle and you moderate a little bit and you drive up on another product cycle.","So, we're just in that moderation phase, but the team is just I mean A plus across the board with the distraction of sales process, which was immense and given sort of the CMA sort of process here in the last six months. So, great, great remarks to the team there and were certainly - add momentum to try to re-market the process, the business now and have a better outcome.","Rob Crisci","And I would just add, they did perform very well in the second quarter. So good performance.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Moving next to Robert McCarthy at Stephens. Sir?","Robert McCarthy","Hi, guys. Good morning. Sorry, I'm about jumping from call to call, but I guess the first question is building on Deane's excellent questions, in terms of the short cycle, you are not planning for any kind of contemplated balancing guidance here. You're telling your business heads to kind of focus on cash and margin, which is sensible.","You said I think six or seven of your segments are really - are your companies within the broader of it, are kind of affected, I mean have you highlighted the past exactly which one of these segments or sub-segments these are and could you just kind of highlight what you're seeing with that kind of level of granularity.","Neil Hunn","So, it's the thing I should have mentioned related to Deane's question is, the Strewers, alpha, it's Danisco, it's Hardy [ph], I mean there is four or five other that are much smaller but the trends and I just talked about are consistent across all of this, they are not isolated to one. It was very consistent read across our seven or eight companies here on the trends that we said, but it\u2019s the industrial complex that 8% of revenue that we have.","Robert McCarthy","And then with respect to Gatan, I was under the impression that there were not that many natural buyers or potentially, I guess private equity. But could you talk about the fact that you think you've got a lot of interest because that doesn\u2019t square with what I have heard maybe I\u2019m just an idiot, but I will leave it there?","Neil Hunn","We know what Gatan is right, it\u2019s a clear market leader, it has great growth prospects of a longer time, it's got a great team and amazing cash flow and so, as a result, there is a lot of people that are interested in a business like that, strategic and sponsors alike.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then the final question is you know, I was going to ask about obviously, the Foundry acquisition. It sounds like you answered the question, it sounds this elevation of - is it Jody Madden that you've kind of taken the key man risk or the key creative soul risk out of the equation, because obviously you think about companies with this nexus of technology and entertainment.","You think about Steve Jobs or Jim Hansen or whoever the case may be, you don't want that person walking out the door, I mean would you say she rises to that level when there are other people within the company or the organization that you've made a real strong push to just retain because obviously at the end of the day. This is probably much more of a human capital business than some of the others?","Neil Hunn","Well, first I would say Foundry really like all of our software businesses is just a really boring software business, right. The great software that enables creators then do amazing work. Right. We're not the creative part of the ecosystem or supply chain and visual effects, we're the enabling toolkit that allows that to happen.","Sort of maybe the first statement that\u2019s highly consistent characteristics with really every Roper business, not just the product software businesses, but the product businesses.","The team, I think we mentioned last quarter that the totality of the Foundry team that we met in the diligence process and confirmed here in the first little bit of ownership, the breadth of that team, that depth of that team is quite strong.","And when we sat down and did the onboarding and started to engage with the team about our long-term orientation, multiyear product strategy, multiyear go to market strategies. It just became very clear to the incumbent CEO, Jody, ourselves that the most natural fit for the long-term success inside of our framework was Jody. And she's, she's fantastic. She's for the last four or five years has been the face of the company relative to the product. And we're expecting her to do great things with the business.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for entertaining my questions. Congratulations for a great quarter.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about some of the pipeline dynamics that seem to come up a lot where, you have kind of a surfeit of actionable deals, but opportunity cost dynamics are always at play. I'm wondering how that works as a partial gate to timing of deal flow. And as a curiosity, when was the last time you had kind of an air pocket and actionable pipeline dynamics?","Neil Hunn","I've been at Roper for eight years, and I cannot recall a real air pocket in terms of the pipeline. I mean, it's always a steady drumbeat, multiple deals, presented at near final stages to our board, five times a year. I mean, so air pockets or? I can't recall, I'm looking at Rob he, he's agreeing with me.","Relative to we're always to your first question about opportunity cost. I mean, this is a very, it's a debate we have on every transaction, right? You're coming across one that it looks really good, right?","It has all the characteristics, we look for niche, leadership, great team, accretive CRI, accretive organic growth rate you know the list. And or like and the price might be X and are like, that really looks good. But is there something better that's just right around the corner. So, we're always having the opportunity costs discussion. And it's one of those things that that we've sort of honed over the years, and we do the best we can relative to that decision.","It's obviously an opportunity cost decision. One, where we don't have perfect information about what's around the corner. And then we're always steeped in what gives us real confidence.","And ultimately, everything we do is we're just steeped in the cash return methodology. There's always that buffer built in day one when we buy a company relative to the values created for shareholders. And so that's at least how we think about it.","Rob, you want to add any color to that.","Rob Crisci","No, there is always an opportunity. And it's just a matter of finding the best deals at the right price and getting them done.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, thanks. And then follow up is on TransCore, the product implementing without you. That seems pretty groundbreaking for TransCore, maybe I'm wrong. But could you elaborate on that thought?","Neil Hunn","Well, hey, it's very early. We got a great partner in Gentex, right. They are the clear market leader in the smart mirror technology. And so, it's been a nice collaboration with them. But yes, I do believe it has the potential to be groundbreaking.","You know think about cars 10 years ago, or five years ago, you didn't have auto sensing, lane departure systems and whatnot. Now, they're almost standard. So, I don't know if this technology becomes standard like that, but it's certainly our hope that it would. And it's great to have Audi as the first partner.","There is a lot of work that had to be done not just in the technology that goes in the car, but also how you deal with intra-tolling agency and customer relationships and how you deal with the billing and, and that's all been figured out by the partnership between TransCore and Gentex. It\u2019s super early, but we certainly thought it was exciting one of the highlights for everybody today.","Christopher Glynn","Sounds good. Thanks.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Barclays and Julian Mitchell.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Jason [ph] on for Julian's. Good morning.","Neil Hunn","Hey, Jason.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe just a question on the Gatan add back guidance. It was sort of our impression that the annualized Gatan divestment impact would be closer to $0.60 of EPS adding back 20 just kind of wanting to reconcile the difference there just sort of the half year basis seems like it would be closer to 30. Is this sort of seasonality of earnings or are there other dynamics that plays of just lowered organic sales growth outlook? Even just as we're modeling for 2020, et cetera?","Rob Crisci","I think you have too high of a number for Gatan, full year of Gatan would be. So, this is consistent with sort of what we saw for the year all along. There's certainly a lot of variability in the potential for their performance in the second half as Neil mentioned.","Now, I think that their fourth quarters are generally their highest quarter of the year. There's some seasonality there. So, there should have a better fourth quarter than the third quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. And then maybe moving a little bit away from the short cycle businesses to Deltek, I know it's been mentioned for a couple of quarters that there's bolt-on M&A sort of going on there. Is that still the plan for Deltek moving forward? It seems like the booking\u2019s growth is doing quite well. I just wondering if that was still a strategic focus with the business?","Neil Hunn","Sure, I mean, it has been and for a long time, it even predates our ownership Deltek sort of did one-ish bolt-on a year before we owned it for several years, we're probably at that pace or maybe just a touch higher in our ownership. And we would expect that to be the case going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. And it seems like the in moving on to CCC, just in the new construction business seems like it had the expected strength that you sort of called out in previous calls. Just kind of wondering where that you view that strength of the LNG pipeline in terms of its still extremely early innings or four to six quarters, seems like a reasonable baseline timeline for that?","Neil Hunn","Yeah. So, what's characterized is some of these projects that are in development are actually smaller and quicker to come online than what we may have might have seen five, seven, eight years ago.","So, in the past, it would have been multiple years, so I think your four to six quarters is probably more in-line with the expectations. You might drag out a little bit longer as you know these projects do, but these are not five to 10-year projects or three to seven-year projects, they tend to be smaller record to turn on.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Tusa at JPMorgan.","Stephen Tusa","Hey, guys, good morning.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Steve.","Rob Crisci","Good morning.","Stephen Tusa","Appreciate the use of the term of Socratic [ph] coaching. That was a political science major. I'm not I'm not quite sure what that means, but I kind of get it.","On the software businesses, I guess, the application software business. I mean, I read all these other companies, transcripts, and I don't quite know what I'm reading but they use the term bookings a lot. How is the booking like the organic bookings growth as you guys define it for, I guess that segment?","Neil Hunn","Steve, so let me Socraticly walk you through this.","Stephen Tusa","I need some -- I clearly need some coaching as well. So, I just appreciate a little color.","Neil Hunn","Yeah, but for the segment now, we've got to go company-by-company around bookings, right. So, I mean, that's a harder question to answer because it's -- we don't know anything up at the segment level.","Rob Crisci","Maybe bookings and gap sort of bookings.","Neil Hunn","Sure. So, bookings in this case is or another term, you might hear uses order intake. So, it's what is -- what businesses actually contracted in a period of time and you have to do a fair amount of, sort of equivalency between a perpetual deal and a SaaS deal.","And so -- and then, and obviously, when you booked something, you could have double-digit bookings. And then if it's all SaaS, then it's going to take four quarters right to get into the run rate. So, your gap revenue will lag, could lag that a little bit.","And then on perpetual, you might book something in the second quarter, and you might not be able to recognize the revenue because of some delivery in the software and it might be pushed out a quarter or two as things are being implemented.","So, bookings are just a little bit more -- order intakes a little bit more of an early read of business activity that's ongoing in the company. So, in Deltek's case, which we highlighted, we had the hard comp against the wonderful second quarter of last year, which by the way is a great problem to have because we want so much business on a perpetual basis a year ago.","And when we sort of normalize for the outsized perpetual growth a year ago at Deltek, bookings are up double-digits this quarter. So, the activity inside that business review is healthy.","Stephen Tusa","Got it. Okay. And so that's up inside that business that was up like, I don't know, those bookings are like double-digit or like high singles, that's kind of what gives you confidence for the second half in the next year, if you will?","Neil Hunn","That's right. It's a combination of the bookings. And then you're also looking out several quarters at pipeline coverage and pipeline sort of conversion rates and things but the combination between that and the near-term bookings is what give us the confidence.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Were there any businesses in that application software side that were down on revenue?","Neil Hunn","Well, in that we know, your favorite topic of Sundquest is in this segment and it was down mid-singles, as we expect - it actually did modestly better here in the quarter in the first half, we thought, but other than that everything was up pretty much.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, that's great. And then one last one, acquisition pipeline, standard question. Are you bullish about -- any more bullish about the second half relative to couple months ago, anything loosening up or does the kind of macro environment delayed some of the activity you may have thought you would have seen?","Neil Hunn","I would say we feel the same today as we felt last quarter-to-quarter before. I mean, the market and the activity are there, its robust, there is lots of work. We're looking at lots of things as we always do, and you just never know until the very last minute in a deal if it's going to sort of one that we actually want execute, and one that we can actually lend from a value in contractual terms perspective, but it's steady as she goes on the M&A front.","Rob Crisci","Yeah, there is nothing in the macro environment that -- there is nothing in the macro environment that impact these deal processes at all. They're hopping [ph] and, you know?","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Super. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the detail.","Neil Hunn","Our pleasure.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Giordano at Cowen and Company.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, good morning.","Neil Hunn","Good morning.","Joe Giordano","So now that we're getting into a little bit of an industrial cycle, I guess the question that you guys typically get asked, will get asked a lot more, like, how does this make you think about some of your industrial businesses from a long-term basis. Does it become somewhat of a nuisance when 8% of your company becomes something that gets talked about more than 8% of the time as we enter these types of things, and how do you think about the positions of those businesses within the context of Roper long-term?","Neil Hunn","Yeah, so its first, these businesses are amazing. I would just draw you to the profitability of both, the industrial businesses and the process segments. They're amazing businesses, they're clear leaders in their niche, they're just they're fantastic. Yeah, they have a little bit of cyclicality associated with them.","But we've worked over the last decade, to meaningfully reduce the cyclicality. And it was roughly a 50% tie that these businesses these more cyclical businesses a decade ago, and now we're about 20%. And so that trend will continue as we deploy the capital going forward.","We're generally deploying a thing that don't have a large cyclical component. So, continue to de-emphasize sort of the cyclical aspects, but they're great businesses and it's and we like them in the portfolio.","Rob Crisci","And they're designed to be incredibly profitable at all points of the cycle right there. As you know, we're always looking at the breakeven analysis, what\u2019s the fix cost, what\u2019s the variable cost. Our business leaders are very, very proactive. So, they're always going to generate a lot of cash in all environments, and their position to succeed over the long-term. So, we believe we're a great owner for those businesses.","Joe Giordano","Okay. Yeah, you guys have been very consistent with that answer over time. So, appreciate that. Are there any specific cost actions that you're looking at, as we enter this period, though, for them, like is there any unique cost out opportunities that you're that you now you can execute as things kind of slow for them?","Neil Hunn","I wouldn't say unique, but what maybe is unique about the Roper model, and this is just building on Rob said, these businesses structurally are highly variable in their nature, they buy structural, right.","So, any sort of cost actions can happen pretty quickly and without lots of sort of riff or cost to get the cost out, if you will. And so, the companies also naturally start feeling and pulsing their way when they feel softness and take the actions out, any sort of direction from us, right.","And so, we're certainly talking with them and understanding what they're doing. And making sure their assumptions are aligned with our assumptions about what the future looks like. And then they go about doing what they do in managing their businesses.","Joe Giordano","Okay. And maybe last for me. Just curious about your -- the outlook, maybe from your customers standpoint about some of the commercial building sectors that you're exposed to. And I know there is some nuance with some of your businesses, whereas if some construction volumes go down a little bit, it's actually good for like a business like in ConstructConnect thing that used to help and funding the work, but just generally like what are your -- are your customers, kind of getting raised antennas about the health of the or directionality of their businesses over the near-term of very robust levels?","Neil Hunn","Yeah, hard to get a read across that, like you said at our ConstructConnect business, which is in the pre-construction part of commercial real estate development. We actually root for a","a neutral to slightly positive, slightly bearish market, because that increases the value of what we deliver to our customers. But it's -- I don't have as we sit here today great read across or read through from ConstructConnect on broader construction themes. So far and it will help you there.","Joe Giordano","Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Neil Hunn","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's call. And at this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference back over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you, everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.","Operator","And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Baird","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company","Operator","The Roper Technologies Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. For your information today's conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.","Zack Moxcey","Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now, if you'll please turn to slide two; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to slide three; today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.","For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; a onetime debt extinguishment charge; and lastly, a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amounts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","And now if you'll please turn to slide four, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Zack and good morning everyone. Before going through today's agenda, we'd like to thank all of you who have reached out to express your support and concern for Brian, our Executive Chairman. On a personal note, I would like to thank Brian for his tremendous leadership and his long-term mentorship to me. I want to assure everyone it's business as usual here at the company which you'll see throughout today's presentation. We have a very deep and talented management team both in the field and here in Sarasota that is committed to the continued execution of our proven strategy.","To that end, we recently promoted both, Rob Crisci, our CFO and John Stipancich, our General Counsel to Executive Vice President. These promotions are indicative of their past contributions to the enterprise and also their go-forward contributions to the team here at Roper. Our CIR based processes and disciplines are deeply embedded in our culture and we'll continue working to make Roper an even better company in the years to come.","Now turning to today's agenda. We'll start with our Q3 enterprise results then turn to our segment performance and outlook followed by our guidance update and then we'll open up for questions.","Next slide please. As we look at our Q3, 2018 enterprise highlights, it was really a fantastic quarter. Record results with revenue, EBITDA, net earnings, cash flow and virtually any financial category that you can look at.","Revenue grew 13% to $1.32 billion with organic revenue growth of 9%. We saw double-digit revenue growth across all four segments, really just fantastic performance and very broad execution.","Gross profit grew 14% with gross margins expanding 80 basis points to a record 63.8%. When you look at gross profit gross profit margins, it really highlights the power of our niche strategy and our team's ability to nimbly execute through the quarter.","As we look at this margin, there was very little impact of tariffs or any cost push inflation that flowed through our numbers. It was really just spectacular performance across the board relative to our margins.","EBITDA grew 16% to $473 million. EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points to 35.8%. Importantly, we saw double digit EBITDA growth and margin expansion across all four segments. Earnings before taxes, grew 18% to $411 million DEPS grew 31% to $3.09 and free cash flow grew 34% to $404 million or 31% of revenue.","So as we look at the quarter, we're certainly delighted with the breadth of the performance, but also like the top to bottom leverage. You can see that revenue grew 13%; gross profit grew 14%; EBITDA plus 16%; earnings before taxes 18%; DEPS 31%; free cash flow 34%; leveraged all the way from the top to the bottom, really a fantastic result.","Now I'll turn it over to Rob to take us through the income statement.","Robert Crisci","Thank you, Neil. Good morning everyone. So, on the next slide, we have our Q3 income statement metrics, a little bit more detail on some of the numbers that Neil had outlined on the previous slide. On revenue, our results with a 13% overall growth and 9% organic growth, we exceeded importantly $1.3 billion in the quarter for the first time and we remain on track for double-digit revenue growth this year, our margins up, 80 basis points, our gross margins up 100 basis points, our EBITDA margin.","As Neil mentioned, EBITDA margin expansion across all four of our reporting segments and 16% EBITDA growth overall. Again we like to point out that the growth this year in earnings before tax as many of you know, we are a company that benefits quite a bit from the recent tax reform, but even setting that aside, we're able to grow our earnings before tax at 18% in the quarter, a very nice results. And that if you carry that down to the DEPS line, we grew 31%.","I would note on the tax rate for the quarter of 21.5%. That was a little bit better than we expected coming into the quarter. We would expect to be right around 23% for Q4 and that number is embedded in our guidance.","Next slide please. The next slide is an important slide to Roper, the cash flow slide. It really was an outstanding cash flow quarter, excellent growth of 32% operating cash flow and importantly an increase of over $100 million in cash flow versus last year. On the free cash flow line, $404 million of free cash flow.","As you see here $418 million of operating cash flow converts to $404 million of free cash flow, the first quarter that we've exceeded $400 million in free cash flow and that's really a testament to our asset light model with very little CapEx and the ability to really generate a lot of cash as we continue to compound.","On the full year basis, we certainly expect to be double digit cash flow growth. We're now up to 12% year-to-date versus last year and operating cash flow at $966 million year-to-date.","Next slide. Again another important slide for Roper especially is our asset-light business model networking capital slide. So as of 9\/30\/18, you can see on the column on the right, our inventory 4.4% of revenue; receivables 16.6% of revenue; payables and accruals 11.5%; and importantly the deferred revenue number up to 11.7%. If you net all those together, you see once again negative networking capital for the company minus 2.2%. So we always like to look back at a little bit of a longer-term trend here really if you can see Roper's transformation over time.","So if we look back to five years ago on September 30 of 2013 we had inventory of 6%, receivables of 18%, payables and accruals of 11.5% very similar to this quarter, but deferred revenue was only 6%. So if you have to 9\/30\/13 to today you can see a massive increase in our ability to generate cash and working capital and that's massively negative working capital that we expect to continue.","So on our deferred revenue basis, we had about $212 million of deferred revenue back in 2013 that's now up to $620 million in 2018, and we expect that number to continue to increase moving forward.","Next slide. So as far as strong financial position, well, one of our guiding principles are our capital structure here in Roper is to always be opportunistic on when we access the bond market. As you know, we're more committed to investment grade and we always want to make sure our leverage are - is at reasonable levels. And we're able to go ahead and complete a bond offering in mid-August and what's really a good environment with the 10-year treasury a little bit below 2.9%. So we completed 1.5 billion bond offering pretty close to evenly split between five and 10.","And as part of that we decided to go ahead and redeem our 2019 6.25% notes a little bit early, so that did result in a $16 million one-time debt extinguishment charge in the quarter. As we look at that decision the is very attractive versus waiting to commit to next year in a rising interest rate environment, so we think the breakeven there was really kind of a no-brainer going ahead to do that. So we did that and we're happy with the result of the offering.","So where we sit today now is $4.1 billion of bonds that's after our October 1st maturity where the bonds went over to the revolver. So now we have $4.1 billion of bonds at a weighted rate of about 3.5%. So, really well positioned from an interest rate cost of capital perspective moving forward.","Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is now down to 2.8 times, and notably, as before we received the Gatan proceeds so with that transaction does close, it should bring us to another $700 million or so of after-tax proceeds that would further reduce leverage. So we had a very strategically positioned on the balance sheet and I think very, very well positioned to fund capital deployment moving forward.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.","Neil Hunn","Thanks Rob. Now let's turn to our segment detail outlook. We can turn to our RF & Software segment. In the quarter, we saw revenue of $563 million, an increase of 14% for the quarter. Organically, revenue grew 4%. Importantly, the Software business wherein the segment grew organically 6% and toll and traffic this was in line with our expectations.","Operating profit grew 16% to $168 million. Operating margin has expanded to 29.8. EBITDA grew 17% to $226 million, which represents a 40.1% EBITDA margin.","In the quarter, we saw continued strong performance at Deltek across its government contracting and its professional services end market in terms of its software execution. It's nice to see that continued benefit of our relative market share advantage and our superior product offering in the government contracting space leading continued share gains. Also Deltek's professional services software offerings continued with its positive momentum with our new product Vantage Point. Finally, with Deltek they continue to see strength with the SaaS migration strategy driving increases in its recurring revenue. We also saw in the quarter outstanding growth at our Freight Matching business due to network expansions with increase in net subscriber adds and favorable end market conditions.","With our Freight Match business both sides of the network scaled quite nicely in the quarter and this is a business where the size of the network and the scale of the network matters quite a bit, so we're seeing increasing returns of scale in this business. We saw double digit add rate growth aided by share gains. We talked in the past about the share gains in the large loss space and we continue to see those in the quarter. Also we saw good traction with our new SaaS offering targeted at the mid-law space.","PowerPlan our acquisition we announced last quarter also performed well in the quarter and it was great to see SaaS wins in the adjacent end markets of manufacture and retail. PowerPlan has onboarded quite nicely. We talked about the last quarter. They've done a great job becoming acclimated to our culture and to our strategy tools. We're looking forward to having our planning session with them next month and we're certainly encouraged by their SaaS migration gaining traction as they talked about in our sale process.","Also it's important to note, really all our software businesses did well in the quarter. We just sort of ran out of space on the slide here to talk about iTrade, talk about ConstructConnect, talk about CBORD really the entire software franchise here did quite well. Relative to our toll and traffic business, the pipeline of opportunities is favorable as we head into 2019. And with that as we look to Q4 we see 6% to 8% organic growth in the segment. We see the software businesses continuing with their consistent strong growth and cash performance and see this carrying into next year. Toll and traffic improves as we mentioned last quarter based on the timing of tax shipments and easier project comps.","Turning to the next page, our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment. In this segment which represents 29% of Roper's revenue, revenue grew 11% to $380 million. This is all organic growth. It's really fantastic performance in this segment. The Medical businesses grew 7% organically and our Scientific Imaging businesses grew as expected based on delivering on the backlog.","Operating profit grew 15% to $133 million, operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 35%, EBITDA grew 11% to $161 million and that represents an EBITDA margin of 42.4%. We saw very solid growth across the majority of our niche application software businesses serving health care markets. For instance, Strata continued to gain share in its SaaS-based cost accounting and decision support applications.","SoftWriters continue to gain market share and its pharmacy operations software targeted towards institutional pharmacist also did a nice job coupling it's bolt-on products to its new customers. SHP continued core growth in its home health business and is also launching a new product targeted towards hospitals and Data Innovations continued its global market share gains serving the middleware market.","Verathon had a tremendous quarter growing double digits. The demand for our new BladderScan technology was robust. We believe this is because the core technology embedded in the product, leads it to be the best market product in the market.","Also, North American sales execution was terrific. The funnel management, their closer rates, being fully staffed, all led when combined with the product superiority to market share gains in the quarter. And finally as it relates to Verathon and the GlideScope business, recurring revenue was quite strong. This is a result of a very large global installed base of our Video Laryngoscope System and the recurring consumables being pulled to the installed base.","For Verathon, this is one of many examples of Roper where the management team there is building this business for the long term and we expect to see this momentum carry into 2019, so really a great job by Earl and the team in Seattle. Northern Digital grew on the continued adoption of its proprietary electromagnetic measurement technology. We often have highlight many of our specific medical technologies, but MBI and their EM technology is really a great example of our innovation.","As we look to Q4, we see 5% to 6% organic growth for this segment. We see mid-single-digit growth for the medical businesses and the Gatan Divestiture expected to close by the end of 2018 and is on track.","Next page. Our industrial segment which is 17% of Roper's technology grew 15% to $230 million. Obviously this is all organic growth. Operating profit grew 19% to $74 million; operating profit margin grew 120 basis points to 32.3%; EBITDA grew 18% to $78 million which represents a 34.2% EBITDA margin.","In the segment we saw double-digit growth again at Neptune which is driven by continued share gains. Really what's happening in Neptune is we see many customer networks form and when you combine that dynamic with our strong channel management; it's really those two things that are yielding our continual share increases.","In the quarter, we also saw strong fluid handling growth across multiple end markets and applications. Roper Pump and Cornell Pump continued their share gains and we're also aided by favorable end market conditions. For the outlook for Q4, we see mid single organic growth with strong leverage as we saw this quarter and the end markets continue to remain favorable. The teams and the reviews for the quarter were quite optimistic heading into Q4 and heading into 2019.","Turning to our energy segment. This segment which represents 11% of our revenue we saw revenue grow to $149 million plus 10%, 11% organically with the point of FX headwinds. Operating profit grew 27% to $46 million. Operating profit margin grew 420 basis points to 31.1% and EBITDA grew 23% to $50 million. This represents an EBITDA margin of 33.6% and the OP leverage was 73% just stunning in the quarter.","We saw double digit CCC growth from a rebound of new construction projects. The team at CCC over the course of the past couple of years really worked hard to position the business and its products to capture the opportunities when the rebound occurred and we're seeing exactly that happen. As we see many new LNG facilities and projects come online next year, CCC is specified and the vast majority if not all of those projects. So it's a very good job by our team there.","We also saw strong growth in our upstream applications and broad-based growth across our industrial end markets. I'll remind you the industrial business that we have here did really well, really all of them did and it's really a collection of niche leading test and measurement businesses that look at rubber testing, polymer testing, vibration monitoring, et cetera. The teams across the board here did very nice.","As we turn into look to Q4 2018, we also see mid single-digit organic growth with strong leverage and the markets remain favorable and the teams also are optimistic for the quarter heading into next year.","Now let's turn to our guidance update. We are raising our full year 2018 guidance. Our adjusted DEPS is now going to look in the range of 11.69 to 11.73, where we're previously 11.40 to 11.56. This represents organic revenue growth of at least 7% for the full year basis. We also established in our Q4 2018 guidance with adjusted DEPS of 3.10 to 3.14, and as Rob noted earlier, a tax rate of 23%, which is slightly higher than the rate we saw in the current quarter.","Now let's turn to the Q3 summary. Our asset-light diversified niche market strategy continues to produce outstanding results. We saw 9% organic revenue growth and was broad-based across all four of our segments.","We had record gross margin expansion of 80 basis points to 63.8%, and all of that got plus some carry down to EBITDA margins growing 100 basis points to 35.8%. It's really a testament to our niche strategy, the intimacy our businesses have with our customers, and our ability to nimbly execute through various market conditions and deliver fantastic financial results.","Our operating EBITDA margins expanded in all four segments and free cash flow increased 34%, which is 31% of revenue. Also and importantly, we are strategically well positioned for continued capital deployment. First, we have a very strong balance sheet and our bond offering captured favorable fixed rates.","Next, our pending and unscheduled Gatan divestiture will further enhance our acquisition powder. And to that end, our acquisition pipeline is quite robust, as we finished the year and head into 2019.","Finally, our proven business model and our CRI discipline drives the ability to compound cash flow, and there's no better example of that done this quarter. As we look to Q4, we have a positive outlook and we see that carrying in the 2019.","Next page. And just before turning to your questions, we wanted to briefly highlight the key tenets of our strategy. This strategy has proven successful for 15 years and this is thus strategy fully embracing our entire team by our board and by myself.","I want to highlight three things about our strategy. First is the business type that comprises our portfolio. Our businesses are in niches. They are clear leaders in their niches. We often have a high percentage of the revenue recurring, which provides stability.","We also have the ability to compete on customer intimacy not on scale. This is a very important point, which I'll come to in a moment. We always have new that higher gross margins are indicative of the value that our company deliver to our customers and all of our companies have the ability to grow without consuming capital.","The second part of our strategy I want to highlight is the operating structure which we deploy, which many of you know is a decentralized structure. This structure works based on the profile of the businesses that we have. When you enter niche, you need to nimbly execute and this structure allows us to do so.","Local decisions are made about resource allocation at our business units. But importantly, just because we're decentralized, does not mean that we are passive owners. We care deeply about strategic development and strategic execution and the teams building talent throughout their organizations. And we do that by deploying a set of group executives to use Socratic method to teach what it looks like across the businesses.","And finally, relevant to our structure is our incentive system. The core to our incentive system is that we reward based on growth. Simply stated this allows there to be complete alignment throughout organization about what's important here and also for trust to be pervasive through the organization.","And finally, the third thing I would like to highlight is our centralized capital deployment strategy. As decentralized as we are from an operating structure perspective, we are equal but oppositely centralized in the way we deploy capital. This allows us to take the excess free cash flow from all the businesses and deployed them in a way that is optimal for our shareholders. We do this by deploying our cash return methodology, which allows us to select the best businesses to add to the portfolio and this allows our strategy be centered on finding amazing business models versus having an end market-oriented strategy.","The way we deploy capital was highly processed-driven using the CRI approach, using approach to evaluate management teams and using an approach to make sure that the businesses that we select to join the portfolio match all the ones we talked about before. And finally, what sits underneath all three of these tenets are three core values. One is throughout the organization is trust and mutual respect. I fully believe this is an organization where bad news travels faster than good and I view that as a core value that makes us a wonderful place.","Second, our cash return on investment methodology. This is not just used to deploy capital, but it's used in all of our business about how to optimally grow. And finally, we work very hard to keep things very simple. As we grow the risk gets the complexity creeps and we viewed it as our core job to make sure that we keep things very simple. So in conclusion, this strategy is everything we're doing for the last 15 years and it will be consistent for the next 15 years.","And with that, we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey. This is our first opportunity Neil to congratulate you on taking the helm and also congrats to Rob on his promotion. And I like that closing comments reaffirming what's unique about the Roper business model, so that was all good to hear. So my first question is since it's such a big focus area across the industrials and you kind of downplayed the issue in your opening comments, but can you talk about any areas of input cost challenges that are unique to Roper? And we heard the tariffs are non-factor, but there have to be some input cost pressures and maybe some indirect tariff pressures as well. But how would you describe that?","Neil Hunn","Yes. So it's Neil. I'll take a shot at this and then Rob can add any color. Let's talk about tariffs first and we can really talk about tariffs and the inflation together. So it's important to note that none of our businesses compete on scale, right? We have these. These are very small nimbly-oriented businesses that compete based on how quickly they can answer customers' needs.","As you know our businesses are not gigantic, so as a result the supply chains are very nimble. And the management teams ability to execute through a tariff issue with either slightly rebalancing the supply chain or working through our pricing increase or pricing policy offset that we saw it the quarter. We saw that carrying into Q4 and into the next year. It's really a very, very small impact in Q3 and Q4.","And the same can be said for input cost. If you look at our gross margins, there's just very little material that goes into what we do. And so what is there it's very minimal and that's our view. There's not much of an impact.","Deane Dray","Great. And then if we - could you comment more on the funnel as it stands today potential size and timing? And in your response, you talked about what those market volatility at downdraft typically due to bid-ask spreads. My experience has been sellers get awfully sticky with their memories of where there are multiple straight at higher, but what's your expectations here?","Neil Hunn","Yes so the funnel as we talked about is quite robust, but candidly is always robust. We just see a tremendous number of opportunities and we are oftentimes just betting through the opportunities and there might be an attractive opportunity we pass on because we think there's something that's more attractive that's going to come into future.","So we continue to be very disciplined, but then that discipline is only outmatched by our patience to do what's right for the long term relative to the M&A funnel. But as it sits right now, it's quite robust and the teams are working hard to mature that. So it's always difficult to time or predict the timing of deals because we're just going to do what's right in the long term for shareholders.","Relative to sizing, Rob talked about the strength of our balance sheet. We've talked in the past about $7 billion over a four-year period. That's just the way the math works out, but we've never - we don't feel or never have felt pressure or budget to try allocate capital or deploy capital in any specific small window of time and that remains consistent.","Relative to the - if you will the valuations between private and public companies, it's something that we'll watch carefully. I do think its public companies get mark-to-market every day private companies don't. There typically is a little bit of a lag to the extent there is a long term de-rating of public companies that does take a quarter or two, perhaps a little bit longer for private companies to sort of realize that's where the market is.","But at the same time these funds are always raising money and they have to return money to capital and so that oftentimes offsets that stickiness if you will. So it's not something that we view as any sort of material challenge to us to deploy capital going forward.","Robert Crisci","Yes I would just add to that Deane. From a target side perspective as we've said in the past, most of the targets that we're going after - kind of north of call it $400 million if value up well over $1 billion. I mean that tends to be kind of the sweet spot for the sort of things that we acquire, given our size and given sort of type of businesses that we're targeting. And I think most of the things in the pipeline are going to be in that general range.","Deane Dray","Thank you and congrats again.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","And I just wanted to publicly say, obviously, we all appreciate Brian and how unbelievable of a run that he had with this company and that wishing you Neil the best of luck in your new role, congratulations.","Neil Hunn","Well, thank you. And I'll remind you and everybody Brian is the Executive Chairman and still involved in the business in that capacity.","Steve Tusa","Yep. So just on this deferred revenue point, I mean, how fast kind of organically does that tend to kind of grow? And could you just, I'm not clearly a software analyst. Just wanted to kind of better understand how that works and kind of the dynamics into the kind of intermediate term. What is driving that and how fast do you expect that to grow as may be kind of as a percentage of revenues or something like that?","Neil Hunn","So it would generally grow in line with the organic growth of the software company. Sometimes if you're moving through sort of a change more towards fast some of our business are, they could go up a little bit faster. There's a little bit of seasonality with that as well so a lot of the renewals you have in the fourth quarter.","So probably generally assume that deferred revenue gets better in the fourth quarter and then after that going into the next year will depend in the quarter sort of when the renewal happen. Many of these businesses they're getting a full year's worth of revenue in advance and that's really what's driving deferred revenue number.","Steve Tusa","And when you acquire a company, does that - that's obviously reflected in that number? Or is there some acquisition kind of mechanics where that is I don't know defined differently or there was like a step-up or something like that. Does that number just go whatever deferred revenue they had on the balance sheet that kind of goes into your deferred revenue number? How does that work?","Neil Hunn","Yeah, so purchase accounting requires you to take a haircut on deferred revenue of what's acquired. So you'll generally have less than a sort of a normal deferred revenue on day one and then that builds up over the next year.","If you've noticed that one adjustment that we make that hit the revenue line adjusted revenue not just adding that accounting-based movement on the revenue where you're actually getting all the cost from a business, but you can't recognize some of the revenue from a GAAP standpoint. So that's where you sit the haircut. You will generally see more deferred revenue growth sort of the first year of ownership than other years.","Steve Tusa","Okay. That's a great reminder. Just one last quick one. How fast did Sunquest grow in the quarter?","Neil Hunn","So Sunquest, the quarter in the Americas business continued its mid single-digits decline for the reason we talked about in the past. The global part of the business and the CliniSys piece of the IPs and the global part of Sunquest grew as we also indicated in the past couple of quarters.","So the story relative to Sunquest is the same in terms of sort of rebasing the North American business and looking forward to getting with the team in the next actually - Monday, Tuesday next week in Tucson to go through their three-year strategic road map.","Steve Tusa","And will that grow in 2019 U.S. course?","Neil Hunn","I think it will continue to be down. The U.S. will continue to be down in 2019.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Neil Hunn","But today some of our businesses - yes. Steve healthcare software group we talked about that grew low single-digit organically inclusive of both the decline.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color and for the accounting tutorial appreciate it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning guys.","Neil Hunn","Hi, good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","A couple of questions for you. But one just to start with Neptune. I don't remember a time period where Neptune was strong. I know it's lumpy, but seems like you've got some confidence going forward. I mean, you said, you made a comment about customer networks being formed. I'd love to get a little more color on that, just not an area we spend a lot of time on. But more explicitly, why our customers picking Neptune? I mean, I understandingly the technology is offered amongst the major three players are pretty similar. So why are you guys winning in this market?","Neil Hunn","Well we would beg to differ that products are similar. And I think the market share gains would demonstrate the customers are voting that way. We talked in the past. It's principally or one of the principal elements is that is the customers have been the journey of migrating from non-networks to network meters and on the network journey from mobile to fixed networks. Many, many years ago the Neptune product strategy was to allow all that to be backwards compatible. And so as the customers - and customer any region with network of meters, they sort of plan that migration over a series of years, not in big burst events and the backward compatibility has enabled this market share shift to happen because that we - the customers don't have to abandon their historical investment. So that's been a key tenet to the market share shift. And when we talked about - I talked about the mini network effect that's happening at the local customer level.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I'll follow on a little bit on Steve's question. I mean, Sunquest, the beauty of Sunquest is you didn't pay much for it. The downside is the outlook I think when you bought it you knew it wasn't going to grow much. But in your deal model, did you have it at some point hitting a decline in growth profile? I mean, I think you pay like 12 times EBITDA which is pretty low for this type of business?","Neil Hunn","I think it was more like 10 times is what we paid for. So we as a group it's worth just reemphasizing as a group of Acute Care Software assets they are growing and we see that continuing. If you peel off what we're talking about a part of the group and a part of a business that we're talking about which is the North American Sunquest business. And so certainly in our deal model, we didn't model that it was going to go back mid-single digits. We had it flat to up lows and going back over history right we bought it there was a meaningful use, tailwind that drove sort of outsized onetime growth over the course of 12 months to 18 months then we had to lap over that. And then we're here with this pressure - competitive pressure in the North American market that we've been experiencing this year a little bit last year and we'll continue to experience in the next year.","Scott Davis","I guess a different way to ask the question is are you on the deal model then? Do you look at it that way, even though it's been a while?","Neil Hunn","This was - there's been so many years.","Robert Crisci","Yes, we added a number of acquisitions to it which we wouldn't have added in the initial model and those all out. So, overall very good platform growth.","Neil Hunn","I think we acquired in 2000\u2026six years.","Scott Davis","Yes I know I know but there's a lot of noise around it obviously and a lot of skeptics and I suspected the time that was in the purchase price. But just kind of point out I was trying to get to. But anyways, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning and congratulations to Neil and his role. In terms of my first question, just wanted to circle back to the industrial revenue growth outlook, wonder if it was just conservatism whereby you do have that steep slowdown in the core growth dialed in and may be allied to that if you can give any color on the order trends or book-to-bill rates in recent weeks?","Robert Crisci","Yes. So for the industrial segment, the mid-single-digit organic guidance for Q4 is exactly consistent with what we said three months ago when we saw how the year would play out. Neptune as we've spoken about on the call is by far the largest business in the segment and they had sort of an unusually strong Q4 from a seasonality standpoint last year. They generally - in that business seasonality for Q4 is lighter than Q3 and last year for various factors, it wasn't - there is really wasn't any sort of a sequential to down Q3 and Q4, we see more normal seasonality this year.","That's a big driver of it. I'd say that the order trends across the industrial and the energy businesses which is really the only place is really can give you an insights here, I mean at Roper or given some of the software, but these businesses we do of course look at the orders on individual basis and I would say they are very supportive of mid-single-digit organic and there's certainly optimism moving forward into next year. But we feel really good about the guide.","I'd say on the energy businesses from a seasonality standpoint, we're probably assuming a little bit less than normal Q4 uptick in terms of seasonality and energy businesses. We just think that's prudent, some of that certainly will have great visibility in here and so we're not assuming a little bit less than what is normal, so could be there in that, but who knows.","Julian Mitchell","Makes sense. Thank you. And then just wanted to circle back to RF and PowerPlan, just remind us what kind of organic growth that business is delivering right now and whether that earnings accretion number for the second half, I think you talked about $0.12 or $0.13 last time, how you're tracking relative to that?","Robert Crisci","Yes we're on track. It's mid to high single-digit organic growth business, a little bit better coming in. It's certainly on track, so that is performing as we expected. I think the team has been a really nice job of quickly getting up to sort of the Roper processes. We had a great quarterly call with them last week and I think we feel really good about the trends of that business.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Robert Crisci","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead,","Richard Eastman","Yes, good morning. Just very quickly just to stand RF Tech. Just a couple of questions, I presume from kind of waiting out the patience here the tolling and traffic was flattish in the quarter. But you did mention a number of pipeline opportunities there. I'm curious are those opportunities are backlog? Does the backlog add to toll and traffic provide any kind of insight into possible low single-digit or mid-single-digit growth for 2019?","Brian Jellison","Yeah. So you're right in the quarter on the distinct flash and again it's in line with our expectations. And I think the pipeline as it sits today now, it's big, it's robust and we're not going to add 100% against that pipeline. But if it falls at this does historically then we would see certain low single-digit possibly a little bit better as we head into 2019 with that business.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just the other piece of this application software where we kind of spoken to Deltek and Aderant some like really good growth rates. But when you look at the software businesses, the app software businesses combined and you see this kind of 6% growth rate combined, what's your feeling from that from a cyclical standpoint? I know this is - there's a lot of recurring revenue in there, but again, you're selling to legal firms and Deltek sales into the government market where there's some pacing of spend. Is the 6% number for that piece of the business running may be a couple points hot relative to a cyclical growth rate for your app software businesses?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, we view this business is to be very consistent growers just very little of any cyclicality associated with them. So double-click for instance with Deltek I can certainly understand that concept that as government spending goes so is spending on the systems. But over history that's not the case because what happens to government contractors flow to where the money is and there's always money being spent. And so that's rising need for them to have the software to drive the compliance and the operations for instance. So we view these as consistent and not like a cyclical business is going forward.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Joseph Giordano of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano","Yeah. Good morning guys.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano","So on RF Tech, if we just assume like for sake of argument that we stop doing M&A and the deal that you've done kind of start slowing will the normalize drop down of that segment be materially higher than what we're seeing now? I mean just feel like that subs we've added over the last couple of years the characteristics of those business are a lot different than what has been in there historically. So like how would you think about what that normalize drop down x the impact of like the upfront cost of acquisitions?","Brian Jellison","So are we talking from a leverage standpoint on the incremental go?","Joseph Giordano","Yeah.","Brian Jellison","Yeah. So the software businesses generally has EBITDA margins 40% plus and the toll and traffic as you know is lower than that. So right, as these businesses ago the earnings leverage 40% plus probably a little bit better than that.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. Is Neptune\u2026","Brian Jellison","That leveraged all traffic business so better leverage as we move more towards software and less cyclicality of course and a lot more recurring revenues and better growth.","Joseph Giordano","Yeah. That's the point okay. Okay. Is Neptune facing any issues currently with like sourcing of electronics environment we've heard a little bit about that on the call side from some of that occurred in that space. I'm just curious if it's anything that you guys are seeing there?","Brian Jellison","There's pockets of that as we do in our reviews really over the course of the last several quarters not unique to this quarter. I think it goes again to the nimbleness of the supply chains of these businesses to the extent there is an issue. They're really sole-sourced supply because again we are not buying things in a massive scale so we can shift production are shift the supply chain where it's needed. But we have seen as I mentioned in some pocket some component shortages, electronic component shortages.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then just last for me kind of more of a conceptual one. Neil, how do you see just in terms of style, I know you have the core fundamental beliefs that Roper is going to remain the same and how did you go about your business, but stylistically anything that you're bringing differences to the environment there? Maybe, how you take input from people or you have a different amount of people around you. Just may be talk about, how you plan on running things versus how it's been?","Brian Jellison","Sure. I appreciate the question. I view it to be very - I mean, the strategy is the same, the structure is the same. The way we deploy capital and the process rigor around that is the same. Stylistically, Brian and I certainly are different people with modestly different styles. I think both are - have been accepted by the organization. I think me having grown up here as a group executive in the trenches across the medical businesses and the application software businesses, as I sort of look to the next several years it's trying to bring a little bit of process - a little bit more process rigor about how we - the companies in the field develop strategy, how we get very focused on how to deploy that strategy and then also how the teams build the talent and build the talent offense within their teams. So it's less stylistically, but more having just grown up in the trenches here where Brian's always been the CEO from the day he started is maybe a little bit different perspective remains which I'll look through for the next few years.","Joseph Giordano","Great color. Thanks guys.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.  Please go ahead.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Jake, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our first quarter 2012.  Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results.  The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call.  We\u2019ve prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.","Now if you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement.  During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings.  You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of all that information.","Now if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 3, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants.  Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thanks, John.  Today we\u2019ll kind of go through the first quarter enterprise financial results and then we\u2019ll get into the specific segment detail and the outlook for each of the four segments for the second quarter and balance of the year.  We\u2019ll update you on our established guidance for the second quarter and our full-year guidance, and then take your questions.","So next slide, please?  The first quarter here was another spectacular quarter.  We achieved all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow in the quarter.  Total sales were up 10% and importantly organic revenue was up 8%.  Our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 at a strong 1.03.  Gross margins reached 55%, which is really quite remarkable, and our operating margin leverage was spectacular in the quarter.  Operating margins were up 200 basis points to 24%, and our incremental operating margins were 43% in the first quarter.  We closed out the quarter with 205 million in EBITDA and an EBITDA margin of 28.9%.","The diluted earnings per share were up 20% to $1.09.  More importantly, the free cash flow was up 69% to 131 million in the quarter.  It is an all-time record first quarter for us and a great start for 2012.","Next slide?  Our first quarter income statement, you can see here that the revenue was up 10%, 8 organic, and book-to-bill at 1.03.  Gross profit up another 70 basis points to 55%.  Operating income was up 20%.  Tax rate was a little bit higher than the first quarter of a year ago \u2013 40 basis points higher, which cost us a penny.  Still, net earnings were up 22% and you can see the DEPS line at 1.09.","Next slide?  We had terrific EBITDA growth in the quarter, and if you just continue to look at our trend you can see on this chart our trailing 12-months EBITDA now is $830 million, up from 685 last year on a trailing 12-month basis and 519 million on a trailing basis at the end of Q1 2010.  So we\u2019ve added 60% to our EBITDA in just the last two years, and our EBITDA margins on a trailing basis are up 400 basis points from 25% in 2010 to 29% in 2012.  People from time to time, investors ask, when are you going to have that deterioration in margin?  Our plan would be never.  We\u2019re just going to continue to move up that line because of the culture and focus we have here.","Next slide?  Q1 cash flow, you can see another blowout kind of a quarter here.  Our cash conversion was very strong.  We had 141 million in operating cash flow, which was $0.20 of every dollar of revenue.  The conversion on that, 131% of net earnings.  We invested about 10 million in capital in the quarter, which was 1.4% of revenue, right within our kind of 1.2 to 1.6% of revenue plans.  So free cash flow was 131 million, 18% of revenue, and the conversion at 121.  A remarkable performance against last year\u2019s first quarter, where we had 78 million of free cash flow last year in the first quarter and 131 million this year in the quarter.","Next slide?  Our asset velocity continues to improve.  I know people keep saying it can\u2019t be done, it won\u2019t get better; but it does get better.  If you look at the same period, inventory is now down to 7.5%, receivables actually dropped down to 14.5%, payables and accruals at 14.9, so our inventory plus receivables less payables and accruals closed out at 7.1%.  If you look at the trend in 2009, it was 9.6, finally breaking below 10, and people would ask us if you could get any better, and the answer is oh yeah \u2013 you can get better.  Two hundred and fifty basis points improvement over that three-year period, closing out at 7.1% - very exceptional performance.","Next slide?  Balance sheet is pretty strong here.  Cash \u2013 if we look at a year ago, we had 261 million in cash and we closed out this quarter with 452 million of cash.  We had drawn a little bit against our revolver, which had 750 million of capacity this time a year ago.  Now, our undrawn revolver is just that \u2013 we don\u2019t have anything drawn against it, so you take that cash and the undrawn revolver and you get a little over 1.2 billion.  Our trailing 12-months EBITDA is now up to 830 million, quite a substantial increase over the trailing EBITDA at this point in 2011, so it of course has a very dramatic positive effect on all of our credit stats.  Our gross debt is less than it was a year ago, and our shareholder equity has increased by $450 million in the year from 2.882 billion to 3.332 billion, which then brings down the gross debt to cap number from 30% to 24.4, and gives us a gross debt to EBITDA line at 1.3.  You can kind of do the math on the net debt to EBITDA line and you\u2019ll come up with quite a remarkable number.","Segment details here on the next slide \u2013 really, all of the segments had extraordinary performance.  They all had double digit growth in operating profit.  Next slide \u2013 we\u2019ll start with the RF segment.  Revenue was up 2% but operating profit was up 12%.  Operating margin was 24.6% for RF, up 220 basis points, and they finished the quarter with a gross margin of 52%.  They had very strong leverage in higher margin areas, obviously, when revenue is up 2 but OP is up 12%.  We certainly had a headwind on that revenue line because the Gaz de France project, which was in 2011, was substantial in Q1 and quite substantial in Q2, was completed last year so we don\u2019t have anything other than administrative revenue associated with that now, which makes comps for RF a little bit difficult the first couple quarters of this year.","We continued to have expansion in both the security and cashless payment systems that we have for higher education.  That drove substantial growth in the software platform, and then our SAS-based solution networks have added subscribers both in our freight systems area and in our food service areas, and our European expansion continued.  Our toll and traffic service business was led by electronic tolling conversion we\u2019re doing in Puerto Rico that adds to our growth and offsets the sort of weakness in other areas around transportation.","For the rest of 2012, we have fighting us, particularly in Q2, the Gaz de France project which is completed.  That takes some revenue away, makes for a difficult comp.  Our pole project activity in last year\u2019s second quarter was a record in the last three years and quite disproportionate to the rest of the year, so that\u2019s a difficult comp.  That said, we\u2019ll still perform better because of the strength of the rest of the businesses in the RF segment.  We expect to have continued growth in software and SAS network businesses, particularly in the campus area and the growth of subscribers in our networks.","Next slide?  Industrial technology \u2013 here you can see revenue was up double digits at 15%.  Operating profit was up 25%, and our OP margins really are spectacular at 29.5% OP.  Compare that to most people\u2019s gross margins \u2013 it\u2019s really quite a remarkable achievement \u2013 29.5% OP, up 230 basis points.  Our gross margins in this segment were 51%.  ","In the quarter, fluid handling was very strong once again as we continue to gain share in the oil and gas industry with the shale activity that\u2019s going on.  We have a variety of new products that are going into our agricultural applications around irrigation, and those are doing very well; and then we\u2019ve had some pumping activity we do in the transport and industrial arena which was quite strong in the quarter as well.  The Toronto water meter project is kind of moving ahead as planned, which gave us some growth in the first quarter, and then the U.S. municipal market in Q1 was relatively strong for Neptune.  We had significant increase in our material analysis equipment and consumables business in Denmark as industrial production around the world continues to expand.  That business continues to have double digit growth.  And the margins in the quarter, as I said, really were remarkable.  It\u2019s an all-time record OP margin for us, which is coming from capturing the leverage off of the growth.","For the remainder of the year in 2012, the segment backlog is quite strong and that supports continued growth, even if orders were to moderate.  The industrial and shale end market remain quite favorable to us, and these outstanding margins that we captured in the first quarter, we believe that the things we\u2019ve done to get better margins are sustainable and will continue throughout 2012 at these higher levels.","Next slide?  The medical and scientific imaging segment, here you\u2019ve got revenue growth, again double digit at 12%, OP growth at 24%, operating margin up 250 basis points to 26.6%.  We were benefited by having Northern Digital in the first quarter, which delivered exactly what we expected out of them on the revenue side and even better margins.  We\u2019ve had a very, very strong first quarter with Gatan in the electron microscopy arena.  Those end markets are pretty good and we\u2019ve recently introduced some products there in the last 15 months which are continuing to grow and add to Gatan\u2019s strength.","Our medical expansion internationally continued in the quarter, gave us some growth as well.  And then this margin performance that we\u2019ve gotten from the operating leverage here in medical really was terrific, and it offset what otherwise would have been a tough first quarter because North American research funding has been quite soft and the life science area around our photonics camera businesses was weak.  For the second quarter, we\u2019ll have some continuing weakness around those North American research markets.  We don\u2019t see that picking up, but it may get better than it was in the first quarter.  ","We expect to continue to grow the medical business.  We\u2019re experiencing an increase in consumables as we think we\u2019re gaining share, and the end markets are favorable in each of the product categories that we participate.  Northern Digital in the second half of the year will become organic for us, and that will help our organic growth profile.  And Gatan\u2019s backlog, which is quite heavy and we\u2019d like to see shipments improve in Q2, but they certainly are going to improve strongly in the second half of the year.  It gives us confidence for the full year as a whole.  Gross margins, I guess I could say, were a modest 65% in medical and imaging in the quarter.  ","Next slide?  Energy systems and controls up \u2013 whoops!  Same old story, isn\u2019t it?  Revenue up 15%, operating profit up 23%, OP margins 24%.  You know, energy systems Q1 OP margins are usually the worst of the year, but these are pretty good at 24%, but will improve, I\u2019ve been assured.  In the first quarter, our compressor controls business continued to grow nicely with projects in both LNG and upstream activities.  The oil and gas markets continue to be very favorable to us in our diesel engine safety shutoff systems and in the valves that we provide, both to oil and gas and marine.  Very good instrument sales for the petrochem and refining markets, and we acquired a small but important company called Cambridge Viscosity, which gets us online Internet capacity around measuring data.  I\u2019ll ask John to talk a little bit about this small acquisition.","John Humphrey","Sure.  We recently completed the Cambridge acquisition, just within the last month of the quarter so it didn\u2019t contribute an awful lot.  You can see it on the cash flow statement, kind of the range that we paid there.  But what this really provides is viscosity measurement for fluids, both in the oil area but also in the petrochemical, so it adds additional technology to our existing set of businesses there.  And so Cambridge will be able to kind of come into an existing sales channel, but also provides additional online work, so outside of the laboratory into the process.  So it\u2019s a nice fit both for us as well as for Cambridge and additional technology, and they\u2019ll be able to benefit from our expanded reach and we\u2019ll be able to benefit from their technology.  So I think that\u2019s going to be a nice acquisition for us that will start to contribute in the second quarter and beyond.","Brian Jellison","Okay, thank you.  We\u2019re going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe, in energy.  We\u2019ve got record backlog at the moment.  We have continuing strength in incoming orders and we\u2019ve got favorable industrial end markets for our one business that kind of fits to the industrial area, our Dynisco business.  We expect that that should continue to be okay throughout the year.  We\u2019ve got great operating leverage in the remainder of the year, and the execution and focus of everybody in this business is quite strong.","Next slide?  This will be our introduction into our 2012 guidance.  I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the quarter and then the full year, and of course we\u2019ve raised our guidance.","Next slide?  For the full year, we\u2019ve raised the guidance to 4.75, which is an $0.08 increase on the bottom end and to 4.91, which is an increase on the high end as well.  And in the second quarter, we\u2019ll have some headwinds and a little bit of confusing data.  Last year we reported, as you can see on this slide, a $1.03 excluding a $0.05 re-measurement gain for foreign currency that we had, and that\u2019s the way we treated that throughout the year on a GAAP basis.  In some reporting services, you\u2019ll see $1.08 which includes the $0.05 re-measurement gain, but our baseline is $1.03.  The second quarter last year was extraordinary compared to the rest of the year, and so it was $1.03 and the second quarter in 2010 was $0.74.  So our guidance for the second quarter of this year is $1.11 to $1.15.  At the midpoint of that, it\u2019s still double-digit growth over last year.  We do have some comparative headwinds around the Gaz de France contract, which was large last year, that we had this North American research softness and we have some toll shipment timing things that occurred last year.  It was the best quarter for the TransCore business in three years in the second quarter last year.  On a full-year basis, of course, a modest growth trend, and that we expect will continue this year but we won\u2019t have the outsized second quarter.","That said, we still look for quite strong results in the second quarter and much stronger results for the second half and the full year.  We\u2019ve raised our operating cash flow projection.  We had said it could be 650 million.  We\u2019re now saying it ought to be between that and 675 million for the full year.","Next slide?  So if we recap here before we go to Q&A, the first quarter produced all-time records for revenue orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow, spectacular gross margin at 55%, very strong cash conversion around the operating cash flow and the free cash flow, with free cash flow being up 69%.  Our book-to-bill strongly above 1 at 1.03, terrific operating leverage which just speaks to the quality of our different operating teams around the world, and we\u2019ve raised the guidance as we go into the balance of the year.  We certainly expect to have record performance for 2012 as a whole, and I think with that, John, we can open it up to questions.","John Humphrey","Okay.  All right, Jake, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A session.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Very well.  If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone.  We ask that our callers limit their questions to one main question and one follow-up question.  We will pause for just a moment.","And our first question will come from Dean Dray, Citi Investment Research.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Thank you.  Good morning everyone.  The comments on shale activity \u2013 so, we\u2019ve seen a big ramp-up in all the fracking opportunities, and you\u2019ve participated both in the industrial side on the pumps and on the compressor controllers, but you\u2019re seeing some investment move away from that given low nat gas prices.  Is that embedded in your guidance, and maybe you can just give us some real-time color as to what you\u2019re seeing in that segment.","John Humphrey","Sure.  Now of course, in our real time color, we\u2019re not really on the leading edge of exploration activity.  We\u2019re more along in how they go about on the production side once they\u2019ve ramped up there.  So real time information, I think you may be able to get better color on that from someone else.","Now our activity there is both on the natural gas side as well as on the oil side, so what we have been seeing at least over the last quarter or so is some of those rigs start to move and really ramp up more on the oil side and less on the gas side as you were talking about.  We still see very solid activity.  Of course, as we have more pumps that are deployed, we\u2019ll see more after-market revenue associated with that as well.  And then the LNG and the other investments, in order to make sure that the transport and processing of the gas particularly, as well as on the oil side but mostly on the gas side, those investments are continuing and those are in our backlog in one of our businesses in particular.  So embedded in our expectation for the rest of the year, I wouldn\u2019t say is a ramp-up of activity; it\u2019s kind of steady state about what we\u2019re seeing today, and that\u2019s our expectation based upon the backlog and the quote activity out of our businesses.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Great.  And then the follow-up question over on the RF side, there\u2019s been some speculation that TransCore\u2019s number one U.S. competitor could be for sale.  They\u2019re in a number of interesting markets and customer relationships and so forth.  Would you be boxed out from an anti-trust reason to be able to\u2014if that asset were available, or the other side, might it be competitively at a disadvantage if it fell into a stronger competitor?","Brian Jellison","Are you suggesting that they\u2019re a weak competitor?  It would be safe to say that there are two large players in this space around hardware applications \u2013 one of those is a European company, the other is ourselves.  There are a number of players in the back office administrative space, and the company you\u2019re talking about, which is a publicly-traded company, has a very, very modest position in back office activity as part of that.  So we wouldn\u2019t view that as being anti-competitive in any way.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research ","","I\u2019m not quite sure I understood the answer.  Would there be a reason that it would make sense to be paired with TransCore?","John Humphrey","Well, as the strongest player in toll and traffic world, I think it\u2019s always a beneficial thing for someone to want to join with TransCore.  But in our future, we feel very comfortable with the set of technologies and services that we\u2019re providing to that marketplace.  We\u2019re happy with our position, but if something else happens there, then we\u2019ll see what that looks like.","Dean Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","That\u2019s helpful.  Thank you.","Operator","And now we will take a question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Good morning gentlemen.  Brian, you were talking about industrial tech and the very strong margin improvement there.  Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but 1Q is typically the weakest from a volume and margin standpoint, and it looks like it\u2019s been the highest ever.  So did mix play into that to some degree?  Can you flesh that out, what drove the margins, and then can you even take it to 30 exiting 2012?","Brian Jellison","Well, it\u2019d be a great goal.  When we think about weak Q1, we really only think about the energy systems business.  I wouldn\u2019t think normally about industrial necessarily being weak.  There is some times based on weather that Neptune might not be very good because you\u2019ve got winter and so forth, but that wasn\u2019t the case this year.  But I don\u2019t\u2014seasonal Q4 for them is difficult just because of the time of the year it is.  I think as long as we get revenue growth, we\u2019re going to continue to have favorable leverage \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.  We expect to have continued revenue growth, so we would expect to maintain or enhance our leverage.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, but it wasn\u2019t a really strong mix component in there this quarter that\u2014","Brian Jellison","No, no there wasn\u2019t.  There wasn\u2019t any unusual activity.  I will say\u2014I mean, certainly the pump businesses, as they grow, throw off a lot of cash and very favorable incremental returns, so that\u2019s something that has grown a lot more in the last year or two than historically it\u2019s grown.  So that supports better results in the quarter.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, helpful.  And then can you break down your second half versus one half expectations, and maybe what you\u2019re thinking organic growth consolidated for 2012, at least a bounded range?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, I think we could take a swipe at that.  Second half organic growth should be better in our view.  Our guidance at the beginning of the year was 5 to 8, and we had 8 in the first quarter.  We would expect less than that in the second quarter, and that or more in the third and fourth quarters.  So we\u2019d still stay generally with this kind of up to 8% organic growth for the full year, and at the low end of that range in Q2 and at the high end of that range in Q3 and Q4.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Thank you.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll move to a question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you.  Good morning, gents.  Just a couple questions \u2013 Brian, thinking about the strength in the secular growth that has materialized in these energy and pump-related businesses, they maybe haven\u2019t been a huge source of M&A although you did a deal in that space this quarter.  But has your view about the long-term attractiveness of those businesses changed for the better?  Might you be more active there over time?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out, Jeff; but the reality is when we look at most of the businesses in that space are trading at relatively high valuations versus their intrinsic long-term value, and they have a lot of assets and we\u2019re still pretty wedded to the concept of being asset-light.  So I think we would prefer to buy intellectual property that we could deploy into those businesses using their existing assets.  I think to find something that we could buy\u2014we have looked at a couple of things, but in terms of how we think they should be valued on a cash flow basis, I think some people are overpaying for those flow control assets at the moment.  As you know, we rarely would, I don\u2019t believe ever, overpay for anything.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And maybe on that, the bias not to overpay seems to keep the M&A activity at a relatively low level.  What\u2019s going on out there in terms of valuations and pipeline and attractiveness of assets?","Brian Jellison","You know, I think there is so much going on that it\u2019s a classic case of you don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s good when the best thing is around the corner.  So in a good-better-best situation with the strength of our balance sheet we have, we\u2019re looking for the best thing.  We think we have a couple of best things identified and we\u2019re doing a lot of work, and we\u2019re very excited about what will happen over the next months.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","So we shouldn\u2019t rule out something meaningful in 2012, it sounds like.","Brian Jellison","I wouldn\u2019t rule it out.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then just one final one and then I\u2019ll pass it on \u2013 Gatan, is there an issue there with them not being able to deliver relative to backlog, a production issue or something?  What\u2019s going on there?  You kind of called it out\u2014","Brian Jellison","A production issue.  They always have very sophisticated sensor technology we have to buy, and it\u2019s oftentimes only produced periodically.  The orders have been pretty good, and they do have some occasional bottlenecks in Gatan, and they\u2019re forecasting kind of treading water in Q2.  We\u2019d suggest it would be better if they swam, so I think they understand our view of that.  But that\u2019s kind of where that is.  We don\u2019t see anything but upside in Gatan for the full year, but they had a really remarkable first quarter and so they didn\u2019t pace themselves at all.  I think they have to kind of gear up here again for Q2 and maybe they\u2019re being a little conservative, for those of you in Pleasanton who are listening.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Great.  Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Thanks.  Good morning.  I want to find out what the assumptions are behind your guidance.  You\u2019ve raised your guidance.  I\u2019m not sure I heard the exact reason for that.  But what are you assuming about the economy, about Europe, about Asia and whatnot in the guidance, because my thinking is if you\u2019re doing this well in a weak recovery, what are you going to do when the recovery accelerates?","Brian Jellison","Well, we\u2019ll do better.  ","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Right, but what if it happens?  What\u2019s behind your guidance right now?  You\u2019re assuming continued weakness in the economy?","Brian Jellison","Certainly what we would see\u2014we\u2019ve had strength everywhere except for Europe, and Europe was positive but it was only up a couple of percent versus everything else being up double digits and Canada and Asia being up over 20%.  We do just see some areas that are going to be weak.  This North American research funding scenario puts a real brake on our photonics businesses in a negative way, so that kind of pares back revenue some from what we\u2019d like to have.  On the other hand, margins in those businesses are not as high, and their cash generation capability is a little less good so they don\u2019t hurt us overall.  For the year, we expect to do sort of okay.  We\u2019re going with a 30% tax rate for the year as a whole.  I think if we wind up with 8% organic growth on the year, I think if it\u2019s not best in class, I\u2019d be surprised.  So we think that\u2019s pretty good.","Now if things picked up and became better, then obviously as the year went on we\u2019d look at higher numbers.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay, so you\u2019ve got a conservative forecast here.","John Humphrey","Yeah, and the other thing\u2014","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","You\u2019re not looking for much improvement in the economy.","John Humphrey","","And Alex, the other thing I would say about that is remember, we\u2019re a collection of many different niche markets, and the things that may be a little bit weaker that you may be referring to around housing or something like that, we don\u2019t really have any exposure to speak of to new construction activity or automobile production, or some of those areas that are more broadly aligned with kind of the more cyclical aspects of GDP.  So as we look at our individual niche markets, we see a number of them that I wouldn\u2019t characterize as weak today and that we expect them to continue to perform well.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Matt Summerville with Keybanc will have the next question.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","","Morning.  A couple questions on the medical and life sciences area \u2013 Brian, can you talk about where you\u2019re at with some of the new products, or the new product pipeline with Verathon?  A couple of the other divisions I think that you\u2019d talked about in the last quarter as having maybe\u2014or last quarter two as maybe having some pretty meaningful launches slated for this year.","Brian Jellison","Well, in Verathon we have a product called Heartscape which is an important product for us, and it\u2019s launched in Europe.  It\u2019s not launched in the U.S.; we still are going through regulatory issues with that to get it launched.  I think whenever it launches, it should be a very good product.  We don\u2019t have it in for much of our guidance for the balance of this year.  It\u2019s more likely to be something that could help in 2013 from the U.S. perspective, but sales have started in Europe, and in fact our leader of Verathon is on a plane as we speak right now, going over to have some meetings over there with people on the subject.  So I think that\u2019s pretty good.","We have some CIVCO and MEDtech products that are launching in the second half, and some things that they\u2019ve been working on that we kind of know are going to beneficial in second half of the year.  And then Northern Digital, we\u2019re doing several things in Northern Digital to broaden their range of activity, which we expect to pay dividends in the second half.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of the headwinds you\u2019re encountering in the second quarter \u2013 the Gaz de France, the toll shipments being maybe unusually high last year.  Are you able to ballpark or quantify, if you will, the hole in revenue that you guys are kind of comping against?  Is that a $5 million headwind, a $15 million headwind?  Can you frame that up a little bit for us?","Brian Jellison","I\u2019d say 10 million or more.","John Humphrey","Yeah, I\u2019d say a little north of 10.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","And then are you able to quantify as well in imaging what the impact is with regards to the downward pressure in NIH and other public funding sources?  Or maybe, how much of your business there do you feel is driven by public funding?","Brian Jellison","Well we want to just kind of clarify in terms of that.  When we say we\u2019re down, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little over 10 million for just the tolling and the Gaz de France, which both happened to be in the RF segment, and it could be even a little higher than that on a comparable business.","John Humphrey","Right.","Brian Jellison","But imaging is a different thing and of course in a different segment.  The problem with imaging is that Gatan will probably outperform enough to make up for that camera softness, but the camera softness from the funding, both in Japan and the U.S., probably a double-digit negative on their baseline.  So that\u2019s likely to be a drag in each of the second and third quarters, and that would be in the mid-millions.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","Thanks a lot, Brian.  Appreciate it.","Operator","Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs will have the next question.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks.  Good morning, guys.  Brian, I wonder if you could help us a little bit with the Aussie LNG outlook for compressor controls.  How big is that business for compressor controls today, and what kind of growth do you see over the next three or five years, given the CAPEX trajectory that everyone is looking at there?","Brian Jellison","John\u2019s opening up his book.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Is he smiling while he\u2019s doing that?","","Brian Jellison","Yeah, he\u2019s smiling.  I think he\u2019s smiling.  That\u2019s a little granular there.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Well, I just\u2014the reason I ask, obviously it\u2019s not a huge business for you, but it\u2019s one of the bigger ones ex-the top couple.  But the CAPEX numbers there are huge, and if you\u2019re thinking longer term on growth for that segment, you\u2019ve talked about double-digit for this year so there\u2019s a confidence and a visibility there.  I\u2019m just wondering if we can think about continuing to see double-digit growth for \u201913, \u201914, given what you\u2019re seeing on the shale gas infrastructure build-out but also the Aussie LNG piece.","","Brian Jellison","Absolutely we would expect double-digit growth \u2013 no question about that.  I mean, we\u2019ve built a great organization there.  We\u2019ve put as much talent in there as any place in the company, and it\u2019s got a very much broader leadership team and capability team.  We have terrific people throughout that organization, and we\u2019ve made some acquisitions there.  You know, we acquired Trinity, we acquired United Controls in addition to the investments in the structure we\u2019ve put in.  I mean, they are absolutely going to do double-digit growth, and we\u2019ve completely refurbished the headquarters operation at Des Moines, which for those people who have ever been there, it\u2019s unbelievable.  It really does look like a technology business now, and double-digit growth will be easy for them to obtain.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I don\u2019t know if John wants to tell us what\u2019s in his book there, but does it get big enough, and is that growth rate big enough to really give you some confidence that energy systems in total can be double-digit \u201913 and beyond?","John Humphrey","","\u201913 and beyond, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a view on \u201913 and beyond yet.  I think most of our commentary is really about \u201912, and it\u2019s true the backlog and the growth that we have seen out of energy so far in this region has clearly been above the average for the segment in total. Brian talked a little bit about the fact that we were up 22%--20% north in Asia and as well as in Canada, but also in the rest of world category which includes Australia as well as a few others \u2013 that\u2019s also north of 20% for us.  And we\u2019ve seen at least four energy systems and controls just north of 20%, and that\u2019s largely driven by the investments that are happening.  And now, it\u2019s still off of a relatively small base, so I don\u2019t want to overplay this, but it does add to our backlog and add to the LNG position that we have, where I think that we\u2019re largely seen as the best control systems provider for any type of LNG plant anywhere around the world.  So the fact that they are making strong investments there at the Gorgon site as well as at others is going to continue to benefit us, we think.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And then maybe just a little bit more color on the slower growth in Europe \u2013 I think you said up a couple percent.  Just trying to recall your profile there \u2013 I guess I thought you were overweight Europe relative to company average in energy and medical, so I might take the comments on funding to mean that medical was a drag and maybe even negative in Europe.  One would assume energy is still running strong there. But if you just profile Europe exposures for us more broadly and just identify which businesses are really driving that slowdown.","Brian Jellison","Well, we actually grew in Europe; just we didn\u2019t grow at the same rate as other places.  So it\u2019s not a matter of not growing, it\u2019s just in Europe we grew at 2%, and in the quarter every other geography was double-digit growth.  So we had 10% growth in the U.S. and 22% in Canada and Asia, and 13% in the rest of the world.  It was just Europe up 2.  So the growth remains fine, and Europe represents less than 20% of Roper \u2013 it\u2019s in the sort of 15 to 18 category, so it\u2019s not a major drag.  Energy was up double digits but medical was very close to that.  It was really the change in Europe was purely from the Gaz de France contract that we had.  It was unique and was just something that occurred, and it was down sharply.  If you hadn\u2019t had that adjustment, you would have had close to double-digit growth everywhere.  So that was\u2014you know, it took some points off of our growth profile.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then lastly, Brian, the industrial markets within your pump business, are you seeing any signs of slowdown there or do you think the growth rates can continue where you\u2019ve identified them here, which I think was up single digits?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, they were probably a little better than that.  We certainly aren\u2019t seen any fall-off in those at all.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great.  Thanks very much.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll move to the next question, and that will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks, good morning.  If you mentioned imaging organic growth, I didn\u2019t catch it; but could you elaborate on that and if that outlook is a little better for the entire segment than you had earlier?","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t know; I thought we were pretty clear when we went through that.","John Humphrey","Yeah, medical and imaging were up 4% organically in the quarter.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay.  And then a broad one on industrial tech and energy \u2013 it\u2019s been alluded to, but you\u2019re establishing some pretty tough comps and a nice track record there, cyclical going your way and everything.  So thinking about the longer term comps and what you can do from here, I\u2019m wondering as you look at new products, OEM and channel expansion work that you do, are those opportunities that remain fundamentally part of the long-term outlook for industrial tech and energy systems to continue to kind of recreate your organic growth profile there?","Brian Jellison","Our industrial businesses really are not OEM for the most part.  Our industrial businesses are our product solutions for direct customers.  In the energy arena, we do some OEM activity, but even there it\u2019s not super high.  But our engine shutoff valves, for instance, somebody could argue that\u2019s an OEM product going into most everybody\u2019s diesel engine.  Fortunately we don\u2019t look at it that way; we look at it as a solution that the customer really requires and the engine manufacturer has to buy.","John Humphrey","And I do think, Chris, that you\u2019re right \u2013 we\u2019ve definitely benefited from the investments that we have made and continue to make in new product development and channel development for those.  I mean, you\u2019ve seen that out of our fluid handling businesses with expansion of channel activity, particularly in wastewater and agriculture areas, rental market expansion, new product applications in oil and gas for our fluid handling, as well as in our energy systems businesses.  And we continue to focus on those areas where customers are really going to benefit from the technologies that we can provide and the application knowledge that we have.  I don\u2019t see that as being something that\u2014our businesses will continue to reinvent themselves, but I don\u2019t really think of it as reinventing.  It\u2019s just a question of expanding their solution set and becoming even more important to how customers are able to be successful.  That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done this year, and I expect them to do that next year, just as they\u2019ve done over the previous decades.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks.  It\u2019s very helpful.  ","Operator","","And now we\u2019ll move to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","","Yes, good morning.  Brian, in the RF technology segment in general as we move through calendar \u201912, is the\u2014should the expectation be that there\u2019s more, you know, service and admin revenue, less hardware, hence this margin profile can actually work from here higher, even though our sales mix and maybe sales level won\u2019t be as great in terms of growth?","Brian Jellison","I think if I understood you right \u2013 let me sort of test that \u2013 that the service revenue is lower than the hardware revenue in terms of margins, so if hardware is diminished at the expense of services, it would hurt the margins.  What you\u2019re seeing and the reason the margins continue to grow is that our software businesses, which are in RF, are expanding and they carry much higher margins, both at the gross and operating level and the cash flow levels.  So those are going to continue to push out the mix of the tolling and service processing portions of RF at a fairly rapid pace.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, so the CBORD, the freight matching, ITrade \u2013 those businesses are up nicely versus\u2014you know, that\u2019s where the mix is coming from rather than a hardware service mix.","Brian Jellison","Right.","John Humphrey","Yeah, particularly on the margin side, that\u2019s for sure.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, understood.  And then within industrial tech, the Neptune business, we\u2019re kind of feeling in the marketplace there that seasonality and weather played a more substantial role this quarter.  Are you comfortable that the municipal market is in fact starting to recover, or is this almost an anomaly based on weather and the seasonal pattern that we would typically see in the water metering market?","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t know.  We\u2019ve read some comments from others, and we wonder.  I think that the weather had to help Q1 for people.  We certainly don\u2019t see a robust municipal market for anybody, and we don\u2019t see speedy decisions occurring in municipal markets.  We have a huge installed base, and so that continues unabated; but there\u2019s no question if municipal houses were in a little better shape, or you had any new residential construction, we\u2019d have a growth spurt.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.  And John, just quick question on Toronto \u2013 is it still reasonable to assume that we can do about 40 million or bill out 40 million on Toronto this year?","John Humphrey","Yeah, that\u2019s our prediction.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yes?  Okay.  Great, thank you much.  Great quarter.","Operator","And that will end our question and answer session for this call.  We will now return back to John Humphrey for closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Okay, thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again in July as we complete our second quarter.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference for today.  Thank you for your participation."],"19189":["Roper Technologies, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey.","Zack Moxcey","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are; Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier, this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now, if you will please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the fourth quarter and year, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue; a deferred tax benefit resulting from the held-for-sale classification of the Scientific Imaging businesses; a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amounts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and lastly a one-time expense for accelerated vesting related to the passing of Brian Jellison.","And now if you'll please turn to slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. During today's call we'll go through our Q4 and FY 2018 enterprise financial results. We'll then turn to our 2018 segment detail and our 2019 segment outlook. We'll then turn to our 2019 guidance and then take your questions.","Next slide please. This is really a fantastic quarter. Revenue, EBITDA, net earnings, cash flow really any measure you can look at was a record for both the quarter and the full year. Revenue increased 12% to $1.38 billion with organic growth of 9%. Gross profit increased 13% with margin expanding 90 basis points to 63.5%. Of note gross margins were increased in all four of our segments. EBITDA increased 12% to $496 million and EBITDA margins expanded 30 basis points to 36%. Earnings before taxes increased 14% and DEPS increased 19% to $3.22 in the quarter. Operating cash flow increased 26% to $464 million, an astounding 34% of revenue. Free cash flow increased 27% to $447 million, 32% of revenue just eye-popping cash flow.","Before we turn to the next slide we want to highlight a few topics. Relative to cost push inflation tariffs, the impact across our businesses in the quarter was modest and manageable, which is clear with our gross margins expanding 90 basis points to 63.5%. Pricing actions already in effect offset most of the supply chain impact but the teams also quickly repositioned certain elements of the supply chains to minimize the tariff impact. Also during the quarter, we had the opportunity as we do every year to spend multiple hours with each of our businesses to discuss and challenge their forward strategy; discuss market trends, customer behaviors and competitive activity; talk through their enablement and execution of strategy; and review the teams' activities regarding talent development.","So as we look back on 2018 and Q4, it was a very good quarter, a tremendous year and another proof point that our strategy works. As a reminder, we have a portfolio comprised of modest-sized business that all have a niche orientation and market leadership position. When you combine that with an org structure that promotes close customer agency and nimble execution and have a widespread cultural orientation aligned on cash returns, great things can happen as they have this quarter and this year. And as we turn to the next page, I want to take a moment to thank our teams around the world for a tremendous 2018.","Next page. As we look at the Q4 P& L, we would just like to highlight the tremendous leverage from the top of the P&L all the way down to DEPS. Revenue grew organically 9%, EBITDA increased 12%, earnings before taxes increased 40% and DEPS grew 19% just tremendous execution by the teams.","Next page. We'll discuss our Q4 segment results starting in the upper left with our RF Technology & Software segment which in the quarter represented 43% of our revenue. Revenue increased 18% to $590 million. Operating profit increased 19%. Operating margins expanded to 29% in the quarter. And EBITDA increased 19% to $229 million, which represented 38.8% of revenue. It's always good, when your largest segment grows the fastest. The strength was across the group. We saw all our software businesses perform very well, Deltek, DAT, Aderant CBORD, iTrade, ConstructConnect. TransCore grew as expected.","Late in the quarter, we acquired a small business Avitru for about $90 million. We'll be integrating this business within our Deltek business. Avitru is a clear leader in commercial construction specifications, content and software space. This product enables architects and engineers to select the correct and appropriate building specifications during the design process. Avitru has an exclusive partnership with the American Institute of Architects and has over 48 customers most of which are architects and engineers. As a reminder Deltek has a leading A&E enterprise application software franchise. 95% of Avitru\u2019s revenue is recurring and they're in the midst of a cloud migration. So this is a nice tuck-in for Deltek. It allows for better channel exposure for Avitru and broader A&E customer base for Deltek to sell into.","Now turning to our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment. Revenue increased 9% in the quarter to $402 million, operating profit grew 9%, operating margins were flat in the quarter and EBITDA grew 7% to $170 million. Similar to last quarter, it was quite strong across the board. Medical product businesses grew nicely in the quarter. Our medical application software businesses performed well and cameras and Gatan also performed well.","Turning to our Industrial Technology segment. Revenue increased 8% to $223 million. Operating profit grew 15%, operating margin expanded 220 basis points and EBITDA increased 14% to $74 million which represented 33.4% of revenue, really capped-off a tremendous year for this segment. Neptune continued to perform extremely with continued market share gains and Cornell and Roper Pump saw their strength continue.","And finally, our Energy Systems & Controls segment which represented just 12% of our business in the quarter grew 1% to $162 million, operating margins grew 11%, operating margins grew 320 basis points and EBITDA grew 9% to $61 million, which represented 37.7% of revenue. As we highlighted last quarter, we expected a bit slower seasonal Q4 ramp across these businesses. Given the volatility of oil late in the quarter, the Q4 seasonal ramp was a touch slower than anticipated, but the teams did a fantastic job managing margins in the quarter.","So a year ago, when we presented this slide we talked about our need to consider rethinking our segments. Throughout the year, we've done work on this and are close to finalizing our approach, which we expect to do so within the first quarter. As a reminder, this exercise is solely focused on how we re-segment our business, not how we operate our enterprise.","Now I'll turn it to Rob to discuss our P&L, our cash flow and our balance sheet. Rob? ","Rob Crisci","Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for waking up an hour earlier than normal to hear our call. So, on page 8, I'll go over the full year income statement. As Neil mentioned, it was an excellent 2018. We grew revenue 11%, which is more than $500 million for the year. The majority of the growth was organic, with full year organic growth of 8% and 9% organic in each of the last three quarters.","At Roper, as you know, we pride ourselves in the ability to grow both organically and through our consistent deployment of capital. And in 2018, we really benefited from both, with the robust organic growth and positive contributions from PowerPlan and our other acquisitions. Our margins also expanded for the year. Gross margin, up 60 basis points. EBITDA margin, up 30 basis points for overall EBITDA growth of 13%, exceeding $1.8 billion for the first time, so we had very nice leverage on the growth. Earnings before taxes grew 15% for the year.","As you will recall, from a year ago Q4 call, we talked about the many benefits from tax reform for Roper. And that certainly did play out, as you see our full year tax rate declined from 28.9% to 21.5%. So adding up all those numbers, we grew our DEPS for the year 25%.","Next slide. At Roper, we always believe that cash is the best measure of performance. And in Q4, we grew our free cash flow, as Neil mentioned, 27% to $447 million. And on a full year basis, we grew our operating cash flow 16% and our free cash flow 17% to a record of $1.37 billion, which represents 26% of revenue. As you can see on the chart on the right, if you look at the last years of free cash flow, we compounded 19% which is very consistent with our long-term track record of double-digit cash flow compounding, and we feel really good about our ability to continue to do that in the future.","Next slide. So turning to the first of our two balance sheet slides. Driven by our asset-light business model, we ended the fourth quarter with working capital to revenue of minus 3%, completing our second consecutive year of negative net working capital. As you can see on the chart on the right, our deferred revenue continued to increase, aided by seasonal software billing as we continued to grow our recurring revenue.","So I thought I'd take a few short moments and sort of talk about why we think negative working capital is so important. So if you assume a $500 million increase in revenue, which was similar to Roper's 2018 growth, a multi-industry company with a higher working capital level, let's say, 10% of revenue, would actually consume $50 million of cash on their balance sheet in order to grow that $500 million in revenue. To contrast for the same amount of growth, not only does Roper not consume cash on the balance sheet, we actually generate $15 million of incremental cash due to our negative net working capital. So we really view the asset-light model as very, very valuable and it accelerates our ability to compound cash in the future. And we certainly expect to remain negative and become more negative over time.","Next slide. So this slide is our balance sheet slide. Looking at our strong financial position and comparing where we were at the year-end 2017 to where we are in the year-end of 2018. And we think it's very notable that we reduced our gross debt during the year by a little over $200 million while at the same time we increased our EBITDA by $200 million. So ending the year, our gross debt-to-EBITDA is down to 2.7 times. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is down to 2.5 times. So it's really a testament to Roper's ability to consistently and quickly generate cash and free cash flow that we can reduce leverage in a year where we deployed $1.3 billion in high-quality exciting software acquisitions. So if you look at our balance sheet ending the year, we are very well-positioned to deploy capital and take advantage of our attractive pipeline of acquisition opportunities moving forward through 2019.","So with that, I will turn it back to Neil to go over the rest of the presentation.","Neil Hunn","Thanks Rob. If I can turn to RF Technology & Software, slide 13, we'll go through and recap this segment and the next three segments for the review of 2018. We can see in the upper left the segment really had fantastic financial performance in the year. Revenue plus 13%, operating profit plus 17%, core margins expanding and EBITDA growing 16%, really a fantastic year. Importantly the segment organic growth was 6% but inside of that our software businesses grow organically 8%. As we start with Deltek and remind you Deltek is our applications software business focused on the government contracting and professional services firm market space, they grew high single-digit revenue with tremendous cash performance in the year.","We break it apart. On the GovCon side in the Deltek business, the scale benefits that we have continued. There are market share gains across both the enterprise or the large side of the government contracting space as well as the small and medium-sized business. On the professional services side for Deltek, the year was highlighted by the launch of VantagePoint and we'll talk to this in a minute about the importance of that. And then we saw early traction in niche professional services end markets specifically consulting and accounting firms. Across both businesses Deltek is in a SaaS migration and for this and many of our software businesses this SaaS migration is a growth driver.","Turning to our Freight Match business, which is our full truckload spot market network business just a record year from this enterprise based on network expansion and favorable end market conditions. The network expanded due to net subscriber adds, but importantly the vitality of the network also was increased by the ARPU or the revenue per unit increasing for two reasons. First, because we're able to capture better pricing based on the value for the network from our customers as well as launched a few smaller products that we cross-sell into for solutions stack our customers.","As we turn to Aderant, Aderant is our law firm application software business. Deane and her team did a tremendous year continuing to gain share from our primary competitor and grew double digits, fantastic job there. iTrade, which is our perishable food supply chain software and network business, grew mid-single digits with solid margin expansion. The team there did a nice job, advancing the products features and improving the tech stack. Great job and we expect great things to come from that team going forward.","ConstructConnect's preconstruction network strengthened and they quite dramatically expanded their solution set. TransCore toll and traffic saw strength from its back office service and software operating and tolling project execution. Importantly the back office software and service they are proving -- TransCore is proving to be quite differentiated from the competition. And importantly that business comes with high recurring revenues and better CRI performance. And also in the year, we acquired PowerPlan in the second quarter another high-quality niche application software business very Roper-like business. And the team there did a great job on-boarding into our culture and is off to a great start.","Looking back over 2018, it was a great year in terms of innovation and that should provide momentum as we head into 2019 and beyond. A few highlights to include, Deltek launching VantagePoint. This SaaS product opens new niche markets for Deltek, consulting, accounting et cetera. But also overtime enables a back-end consolidation of several platforms into a single tech stack. This provides the ability to put more features into their products, cross-sell more new products and drive back in efficiencies.","Aderant entered the year with essentially one offering, large law. They exited the year with three SaaS recurring revenue offerings in addition to the core large law products. Organically, Aderant developed and launched a mid and small law SaaS practice management ERP solution. In addition, Aderant on-boarded, integrated and started cross-selling two small bolt-on acquisitions. One focused on the law firm knowledge management space and the other focused on billing preparation and management. When combined these three new product offerings are building a meaningful SaaS recurring revenue business within Aderant.","Finally, I'll highlight ConstructConnect. This team executed its product strategy and roadmap extremely well during the year. They designed, built and launched the first truly integrated construction planning to take-off and estimating solution in the market. They are core to Roper's strategies and innovation and it was a great year on that front.","Now turning to our outlook for 2019, we expect this segment to grow 4% to 6% organically in the year, with a bit stronger growth with our software assets and a bit less with TransCore.","Next slide. Now as we turn to our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment. This segment represented 29% of Roper's revenue in 2018. Revenue increased 8% in the year. Operating profit increased 7% in the year. Operating margins contracted 30 basis points, which is modestly better than we anticipated heading into the year. And EBITDA grew 5%.","Importantly, segment organic growth was 7% in the year. We saw strong growth in execution in niche medical application software. Strata Decision had tremendous year. They were just voted for the fifth year in a row to be number one in KLAS for their category. For those who don't know KLAS is a Consumer Reports-type reporting organization that ranks health care IT vendors and again Strata was number one for the fifth year in a row. Importantly, they also acquired many new customers most notably the Cleveland Clinic and MD Anderson that they can add to the customer count today.","CliniSys had a good year and we expect the momentum to continue with CliniSys. To remind you, CliniSys is our European laboratory information management business. They boast to 70% win rate on the projects they bid. And across Europe in the various geographies, we see laboratories consolidating. So given our win rate and our large footprint, we expect to benefit over many years as the European laboratory footprint consolidates.","As we turn to our alternate site, growth there was led by our long-term care and home health solutions SoftWriters and SHP. And our U.S. Lab business declined as we expected. We saw rapid growth from our niche medical product businesses, specifically CIVCO, Northern Digital and IPA. We saw double-digit growth in Verathon based on strong demand from our new BladderScan technology and recurring revenue gains from our GlideScope Consumables. Importantly, Verathon reached a milestone in the GlideScope business line this year where the recurring revenue from the consumables outpaced that of instrument sales. So we expect very continued strong momentum in that business going forwards.","Also Gatan's revenue contribution was fantastic on the delivery of their next-generation cryo-EM products. Just take a minute to thank Sander and Ed for their tremendous execution throughout the course of the year in terms of their new product development, their ability to deliver on their customer commitments all while this pending sale to Thermo was in the back of their minds. Great job to the team there. Just ending the year, we did announce the process of divesting our imaging businesses in two trenches. First, as you know, we have a pending sale of Gatan to Thermo. We expect this to close in the second half of the year once the regulatory review with the U.K. is completed. We also announced in December, sale of our remaining camera businesses to Teledyne for $225 million. We expect this divestiture to close in February.","A couple of innovations worth highlighting with our medical group center on Verathon and SHP. Both should help continue our momentum into 2019 and beyond. As we look back, we celebrated Verathon's 10th year under Roper's ownership. It's very encouraging to see the high level of product vitality at Verathon.","First, our new BladderScan product, which is enabled by AI-based algorithms, is established as the best product in terms of bladder volume measurement and accuracy and has the highest reliability performance characteristics. As we introduce this new BladderScan to the world, we are focused on upgrading our leading global market share to our new platform, as well as selling into new facilities and care settings.","Next, there has been tremendous innovation in Verathon's GlideScope, our video laryngoscopy product line. Verathon recently launched a re-imagined cart-based system which does a fantastic job of providing upgraded optics and display technologies, while also doing a better job with the work flow components of the system. In addition, the team wants a handheld version of GlideScope during the year.","Finally, Verathon launched just last month a new product category, a single-use bronchoscope called GlideScope BFlex. There's a very large global push by the market to use single-use versus reusable products due to cleaning challenges. Verathon plans to leverage their very large global GlideScope monitor base in which the new BFlex integrates. It is very early, but we're cautiously optimistic about this new product category.","Another illustration of innovation on the software side is SHP. They've done a great job creating a new product targeted towards hospitals. As a reminder, SHP benchmarks 60% of every home health encounter in the U. S. on a nightly basis. If you're a hospital discharging patients, you discharge to either long-term care or the home care setting.","Importantly, if a patient comes back to the hospital, the hospital is not reimbursed for follow-on services. To help hospitals manage this risk, SHP created discharge planning product to help hospitals ultimately discharge to either home health and\/or managed home health patients during the recovery. As we look to our 2019 outlook, we expect this segment to grow between 4% and 6% organically for the year.","Next slide. Our Industrial Technology Group which is 17% of Roper in 2018 grew 15% to $900 million. Operating profit grew 21%. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points. And EBITDA grew 19% and finished at $301 million for the year. Segment organic growth was 14%. We saw double-digit growth from Neptune, with continued share gains based on their customer-focused innovations. We also had a great year at Cornell and Roper Pump, driven by meaningful share gains.","As we look at our Energy Systems & Controls segment, which is 12% of our revenue in 2018, the segment grew 19 \u2013 excuse me 9% to $600 million during the year. Operating profit grew 20% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points with EBITDA finishing at $197 million or 17% of revenue. Organically this segment grew 7% with strength in our upstream applications where we saw double-digit growth. CCC returned to growth from new construction projects and we saw broad-based growth in our industrial end markets.","Turning to our outlook for both segments. We see low single digits in our industrial segment, which is based on continued Neptune growth, partially offset by upstream oil and gas applications. We see our Energy Systems & Controls segment flat to slightly down in 2019. Of note, we see difficult comps for the segment during the first half of the year.","Let me remind you that oil and gas is less than 10% of our revenue with upstream being about one-third of that. Clearly these businesses had two very strong years. They are not a large part of our portfolio but certainly a cyclical part. Our field leaders remain generally positive and encouraged by January's results, but we think it's prudent to model these businesses somewhat cautiously in 2019 given an environment of heightened macro uncertainties. If oil prices remain stable and\/or takeaway capacity constraints are cleared, our guidance for these businesses could prove conservative.","Now, let's turn to our 2019 guidance. We believe the business is positioned for a strong 2019. As such we're establishing our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be $12 to $12.40. Organic revenue is expected to be between 3% and 5%. Our guidance model assumes approximate 22% tax rate though there are tax planning strategies that may be able to lower this rate in the first half but that is outside of our current guidance model. Importantly this annual guidance includes a $0.25 headwind impact from the pending divestitures of imaging net of interest.","We're establishing our Q1 adjusted DEPS of $2.74 to $2.80. Guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. And specifically in our guidance model, we expect the Gatan divestiture to Thermo to close in the second half but in our guidance model it's in through the end of the second quarter, so Gatan is in for six months in our guidance model. And the pending Scientific Imaging camera businesses divestiture to Teledyne is expected to close this month.","Next slide. As we look back on our year here, it was really a fantastic 2018. Our diversified niche market strategy continued to produce very strong results. We saw 8% organic revenue growth and very broad-based across all four of our segments. Gross margins increased 60 basis points and EBITDA margins increased 30 basis points. Free cash flow increased 17% to $1.37 billion or 26% of revenue. Importantly we are very well positioned for a great 2019. Our CRI discipline, our niche market leadership positions, innovation and high recurring revenue drive consistent and long-term cash flow compounding.","Earlier this morning, we announced the addition of Satish Maripuri as a member of our executive team. Satish will focus his efforts on providing group leadership to a number of our software businesses. Satish has a long track record of building and growing a variety of software businesses. Perhaps most importantly, Satish deeply understand Roper, our model and our approach. He spent the past several months learning about Roper and is now starting to engage with several of our software businesses. So we're very excited to welcome Satish to the team.","Turning to our future capital deployment. We're excited about 2019. Our balance sheet is super well positioned for a strong capital deployment year. The number of very high-quality assets we've seen in the last several months is encouraging, and our pipeline is quite full. Importantly, our CRI orientation and M&A processes help us identify the very best businesses.","As we turn to questions, we want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market-leading positions in niche industries. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management team based on growth and we have a culture of mutual trust and transparency. Finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing companies. These simple ideas will deliver powerful results.","Now, let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question from Deane Dray with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey. You guys are throwing-off my biorhythms at such an early hour this morning.","Neil Hunn","Thank you for waking up early.","Deane Dray","Yes, sir. Hey. Just to start it off, and I wasn't planning on doing this, but I just feel it's important to recognize the passing of Brian. In my career, I've never called ever thought of anyone as a financial genius, but I think Brian was. And it just struck me is his legacy, his business model \u2013 that has the Roper business model, talent development all of that lives on. And I think you're seeing it in these numbers today and I just want to take a moment to say that.","Neil Hunn","We appreciate you saying that and agree with what you said.","Deane Dray","Terrific. All right. So business at hand just was interesting that with Deltek's exposure there wasn't any issue you didn't cite any issue with the government shutdown with all the projects. Do you see any effect there across your businesses?","Neil Hunn","So \u2013 the sort of bifurcate it with what we saw nothing obviously in last year and we look forward into this year. In the first part of January, at the top-end the enterprise side with GovCon it's completely business as usual. As you can imagine, they have gigantic teams and staffs and they can flow their staffs to where the work is. On the very, very bottom-end, the mom-and-pop we saw a little bit of a slowdown in booking activities. It's very, very small part of Deltek, but Deltek is highly confident that rebounds based on their experience from sequestration. All of that business was captured and then following couple of months. And so it was \u2013 we view it as a push, if anything and certainly not lost business. So, in the grand scheme of things very limited impact on the Deltek business relative to the government shutdown.","Deane Dray","Got it. That's good to hear. And then, Neil you gave a bit of a tease about the re-segmentation. This has been talked about for more than a year and it makes all kind of sense. Now, I'm not expecting you to disclose any real specifics here, but just conceptually how does this \u2013 will it look like in terms of putting alike businesses into similar segments like consolidating energy? Where do you think the benefits that come from this, please?","Neil Hunn","Yeah. I appreciate that. So just \u2013 every time we get asked about the re-segmentation, we just want to make sure everybody understands, it's just how we organize the businesses for reporting out to investors. It's not how we operate the business. It's not changing any of the business model characteristics. It's just for communication to our investors and shareholders.","To that end, the design principles are quite simple and straightforward. We want there not to be segments based on end market orientation, as our strategy is not end market-oriented. We'll put like business models and segments and that will certainly have a segment structure that supports our long term multi-industry view of our strategy, as well as having a combination of products and software. But the confusion of having multiple types of products and energy across two different segments, that will all likely be streamlined and cleaned up in new segment reporting structure.","Deane Dray","All good to hear. Thank you.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Neil Hunn","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Just \u2013 and I'll echo Deane's comments on Brian, of course. In terms of the guidance on organic sales, you just grew 9% in the fourth quarter organically. Big step down in the guide, so about 4% at the midpoint in Q1. Maybe just talk a little bit about the segments, obviously, leading that how steep a drop-off you're expecting in industrial and energy. And maybe any comments around the cadence of order intake in those two businesses in the recent months, as you said, amidst the oil price volatility.","Rob Crisci","Sure. Good morning. This is Rob. So, I think, in the two largest segments RF and medical, very consistent. I mean, these are mid single digit organic growth segments for the most part if you go back last year and we expect much of the same for 2019. I think you're right. I think for the industrial and energy segments, we do see a little bit lower growth than we saw last year clearly. And I think, Neil mentioned a few reasons for that earlier. Neil, you can probably expand.","Neil Hunn","Sure. If you look across the aggregate of our industrial and energy segments and outlook, basically you see Neptune and CCC up for the year. We see our upstream assets down. And everything else in aggregate, the bucket of everything else, is flattish across 2019. As I mentioned, the field is generally pretty upbeat and our January activities were modestly strong. And our approach on guidance is we all saw the volatility in December in oil prices in that market. We saw a slight, ever so slight impact on some of the Q4 seasonal shipments that we talked about earlier. We also have a difficult first half comp across our energy businesses in particular.","So we've modeled Q1 down with only modest improvements in the balance of the year. But importantly if the takeaway capacity, the 3 million barrels that's scheduled to come online comes online, or oil prices stay where they are or increase, then there could be positive levers in our model here specifically to the upstream assets that we modeled down for the balance of the year.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then, just my second follow-up around the medical business, maybe just give us some updates on what you expect from the U.S. lab business in 2019? And also just to confirm the delay on sale of Gatan that in no way I assume affects your capital deployment given how strong the balance sheet is?","Neil Hunn","I'll take that Gatan one first. No, I mean it doesn't at all. I mean, we're very active and have the balance sheet that Rob shared was -- it was looking through any impact of the divestiture of Gatan. So we're planning on being quite offensive to the extent that the targets present themselves. Relative to Sunquest, we expect it to be down in 2019, although less down in 2018. That's consistent with how we set the situation about this time last year about what next couple of years look like for Sunquest.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much.","Neil Hunn","Yeah, just to be clear for the U.S. part of Sunquest.","Julian Mitchell","Got it. Thank you.","Neil Hunn","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll year with Oppenheimer with Christopher Glynn.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning.","Neil Hunn","Good morning to you.","Christopher Glynn","Good morning. Nice job. So good comments on Aderant and Deltek on the share gains and explanations there. I was also looking for an update on PowerPlan impact Roper's having, any new initiatives on pricing or sales organizations?","Neil Hunn","Well, we just -- it's still pretty early days with PowerPlan. They had a very busy year last year and a newer SaaS offering around lease accounting. So that had tremendous uptake given the accounting changes. So that little bit of a pig -- through the python in terms of getting all those implemented and they did a very good job, and that we ran them through our planning process. I thought their end market orientation was good.","They're also -- we bought the company that was in the mid-innings of a SaaS transition. So they are quite busy in terms of upgrading their tech stack and just getting the first early implementations on the new stack with recurring revenue SaaS part of that business. So early days. But as we mentioned, they on-boarded fantastically well, and the team has acclimatized well to our governance model and our structure.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then similarly for iTrade, you've had some pretty consistent growth there at least for a short bit here. Just wondering what delay of the competitive and market opportunity profiles is like and particularly outside the U.S. if that's starting to tap.","Neil Hunn","Well, iTrade is mostly a U.S. business. It's not exclusively U.S. but mostly U.S. From a competitive landscape point of view is one of the things we like a lot about our network businesses it is a supply chain network that has network scale that's larger than anybody else. And so the relative market share advantage that we have in that business is quite larger over the next largest competitor, and really haven't seen a meaningful challenger in that business for several years.","Again it's the network scale. And then Rhonda and her team over the last 18 or 24 months have just done a great job on the product and the features and driving even more customer loyalty and uptake. It's always had a high recurring revenues and high retention rates, but now the ability to sell more value in the product stack is encouraging.","Christopher Glynn","Great. Thanks.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll next hear with Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Steve.","Rob Crisci","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa","I have been up since 4 AM, went for run, so this is piece cake, no problem. I say move it up, let\u2019s cut the wheat from the chaff.","Rob Crisci","Hunn didn\u2019t run this morning, so you're a step ahead of Steve.","Steve Tusa","I'm actually joking, I actually broke my ankle on Sunday. So I am not really moving \u2013 move very much. So again, on a more somber note, our condolences obviously around Brian. I echo Deane's comments. I think he said it pretty well. So, sorry to hear about that guys. ","Neil Hunn","Appreciate it. ","Rob Crisci","Thank you, Steve.","Steve Tusa","I guess just the acquisition pipeline with all these kind of crosscurrents out there and with multiples coming in a bit. I mean, is this \u2013 it all, it is cycle timing it all enough to kind of change people's mentalities around deals at all or no not yet in valuations?","Neil Hunn","So, generally speaking, not generally, it's absolute. I think the fact that private valuations, you know we buy everything from private equity, lag any change in public and they also don't have the volatility of public. And so that's just an observed fact in the market. The other thing, I would say to that is valuations remain robust in the private markets. But the assets that we all come to \u2013 I think you all come to appreciate that we look for the niche orientation, the high retention rates, the mid to high single-digit growth, generally non-cyclicality high-recurring revenues.","Those assets and high cash flow low to limited CapEx those command a higher price than your average company. And those are the type of businesses that we look for. So we continue to do that. The other thing which we always do, we do it with our Board, a few times a year as we go through models to say is it better to continue deploying through valuation environments or wait? And every time the mass says to continue deploy through because the compounding effect overwhelms any market timing you could possibly dream up. And so our strategy has been for the last five years to invest through the cycle and we'll continue to do that.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Is there \u2013 just one last one. Now that you're kind of running the show there, what's kind of the biggest challenge you see as far as maintaining this type of performance?","Neil Hunn","Well, the beauty of this business is that it's comprised of 50 businesses. And I won't go through all the things you know about their niche orientation, defensibility, the market share leading positions that we have and so. The cash flow generation side of this business is pretty stable and robust given the assets that we have in our org structure. I think there is certainly a challenge or an opportunity we have to continue to add planning rigor and strategy execution rigor and talent development rigor through that organization, through the organization which we'll continue to do.","And I won't say, it's a challenge, but is certainly something that's obviously top of mind, we spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about how we deploy the capital, right? So we have process and rigor and CRI discipline that really minimize the likelihood of making mistakes. But Rob and myself and the entire team here spent a lot of time on that and continue to try to learn through our history and make sure that we do a good job relative to deploying capital going forward. So it\u2019s how I do cash flow generation, cash flow deployment is how I think about what the job is and the challenges and opportunities associated with that.","Rob Crisci","But I would just add to that you guys you know, that's very institutionalized. I mean, everything that we are doing is consistent with what we've been doing for the last 15 years. Neil and myself obviously have been very heavily involved in all the M&A we've done in valuation and execution in the last six, seven years. So it is no change at all and what we've done in the past, and it will stay the same moving forward.","Neil Hunn","And maybe just one thing \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead, Steve.","Steve Tusa","No, no, you go ahead. You go ahead.","Neil Hunn","Yeah. So the poor transcriptionist missed all of that. But the one thing I would say is that that it's a challenge that I just wake up everyday thinking about. As we get bigger, the concept, that complexly can creep in. It's certainly something that I spend a lot of time thinking about how at every turn we can avoid that, and really keep this thing simple, which is one or probably the single largest thing that Brian left for the legacy is -- what we do is just very simple and we'll continue to do that going forward and that's very top of mind.","Steve Tusa"," Well, it sounds you guys have too much money to spend and that's not a bad problem to have. I think there's a lot other companies that would like that problem. Thanks a lot.","Neil Hunn","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. ","Joe Ritchie","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Neil Hunn","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie","So I thought you did a nice job, Neil, of telling us about the different offerings that are now in place at both Deltek and Aderant. But can you maybe just delve into that a little bit more? What are the opportunities from those offerings? And how are you seeing that translating into growth over the next couple of years?","Neil Hunn","Well, I'll take it one at a time, maybe start with Aderant. The last four -- three or four, five years and the next several years, the large law market will continue to be viable growth driver for the business and all the legacy reasons why we've won, we think will continue. So as you think about building a recurring revenue business, you build it on top of that larger pieces. And so, while each individual piece of the recurring revenue piece that we talked about at Aderant earlier, by itself is small, when you stack it on top of an existing business, it can become pretty meaningful.","And importantly, it extends your \u2013 the company is also working in it's R&D pipeline to add \u2013 to build bolt-on products that you can sell into large law and the mid and small law size practices. So it's just a concept of which we talk broadly about, the software business is about \"solution stacking\". So you spend a lot of money acquiring a customer, and hopefully selling them one or two products.","And then as you \u2013 certainly, once you have the customer, it's much easier to sell them additional product, especially if they're fully integrated in with \u2013 excuse me, the existing products that they have. And so that strategy is specific, not specific to Aderant or Deltek, but ConstructConnect or DAT or iTrade. And so, we can certainly spend more time off line about it, but that's the way we think about growing the product strategies of these businesses.","Joe Ritchie","Yeah. Fair enough. And maybe just kind of following on just staying on RF Tech for a second. Obviously, that business has evolved a lot over the last several years. And how do you think about then the cyclicality of this business? Now that you're so much more of a software-oriented business, if we were to go into a downturn. How resilient do you think this business is?","Neil Hunn","Which business are you referring to?","Joe Ritchie","I was thinking about the whole segment. I mean, obviously, there's variety.","Neil Hunn","The RF segment.","Joe Ritchie","Yeah. The RF.","Neil Hunn","Yeah, sure. So the TransCore business which actually is a highly recurring \u2013 high recurring revenue business, I mean, yes, there are products that come in and out on any given year, but there's a huge base of recurring revenue there. But that continues to be smaller part of this segment as currently reported.","Software has now become two-thirds and growing of the segment. So very, very high levels of recurring revenue. If you look at our RF Tech segment organically over the past several years, I mean, it's very, very consistent growth and that continues to tick upward over time as we've added more of these high quality software businesses. So it's really not cyclical at all in the segment at this point in time.","Joe Ritchie","All right, guys. Good to hear. And again I wish my condolences for Brian as well.","Neil Hunn","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now hear from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?","Neil Hunn","Perfectly.","Robert McCarthy","All right. Crystal clear. Well, obviously I echo the nice things said about Brian, and I think you guys know that. I guess the first question I would have is, obviously, you've given a lot of airtime to this re-segmentation the kind of risk the more cyclical businesses of the portfolio. At some point does it become a situation where it's better in the spin or other hands? Because I just think about your management there they're managing through this, but they are perceived as probably lower growth more cyclical within the portfolio and they're not getting capital going forward. So how do you bridge the gap to keep them motivated, keep them incentivized given the context that clearly you're deemphasizing the strategic importance of this collection of businesses and what's kind of the end game here?","Neil Hunn","Well, I'll start with your last statement about deemphasizing the strategic importance. I would say we're absolutely not doing that. All of our businesses, even the energy businesses are in niches, they are clear leaders. Importantly they are tremendous cash machines, right? Their CRI performance in stunning and so these businesses are fantastic businesses. They do, obviously, have some cyclicality associated with them, but they are fantastic businesses, period, full stop.","So there are strategy at the same. We have a collection of roughly 50 businesses. They generate the cash flow and we take all the cash flow and deploy to businesses that are better than the core. So, that's how I would summarize our feelings on that. ","Rob Crisci","Yeah, I mean there is a lot of investment in these businesses. As you know, it\u2019s like we centralize investment and did it out, these businesses generate high margins and they are encouraged and they knew that. I think Neil talked about some of the innovations in every single one of our businesses is investing to grow. And that's why they have such great performance. So they are all very, very strategic in their own way.","Neil Hunn","Great example of that is both the Cornell and Roper Pump. We've talked now all year long about the share gains that they've had in 2018. Those are directly a result of the investments we made in the channel and the product in the last down cycle. So we were there when others weren't there. And so I think our ability to sort of with the long-term horizon of owning these businesses proves to be beneficial.","Robert McCarthy","Well, now that everybody is awake, I guess, the question I have about acquisitions is you guys have done a great job in acquisitions that\u2019s clear and great job in terms of the core operations of the business. But to I think Steve's question earlier, I mean, how do you keep this performance off in context of capital deployment? Where do you think the risk is? I asked Brian these years ago and he said, really the risk is in -- if we buy company that does not equate the software, the code that we think it has or is it a question of market position.","It wouldn't be a question of capital intensity, because the nature of the businesses that you buy are not going to have surprises with respect to what their CapEx or funding needs are. But could you just talk about kind of ring-fencing the risks around, CRI through the lens, where you look at acquisitions. And if you are going to miss where is it going to be in your relative assessment? Just thinking self critically.","Neil Hunn","Sure. So I'll just -- I'll answer your question through the lens of how we deploy capital, right? So the first step in that approach for us is, do we like the CRI performance, yes or no? That is analytical, objective and is not subject to any bias or interpretation. So before we engage or do any work, we know that it fits our financial criteria. I think most companies that are stretching, or they stretch the valuations and assume synergies that's not anywhere in our CRI map. And so we don't sort of romance ourself into the financial strategy of an acquisition. It straight CRI map.","Second is do \u2013 what we think that management team will strive in our environment. And we can spend more time about this later, but essentially is, are they \u2013 do they love building businesses yes or no? You can actually somewhat objectively determined that based on, if they've been running that business across multiple owners, you look back their leadership CVs, and see if they've had three jobs in their career versus 20. You get a sense that they love building businesses or not.","And then third, so after we know we like the financial performance, we know we have a management team that will strive then is it a business that we like? Is it niche leadership position or early market share advantage, recurring revenue, high retention rates et cetera? So it's not certainly far from impossible to make a mistake, but the rigor of the process really makes it hard to do so.","And so the punch line of that where we have been disappointed in the past is would be summarized and maybe they were a little slower to grow early until our strategy prod tools sort of have time to take effect, but it's far from value destructive [ph] from our shareholders, because there's so much arbitrage value in the CRI map from the onset.","Robert McCarthy","Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","And from Baird we'll now hear from Richard Eastman.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good morning, Neil, Rob, Zack.","Neil Hunn","Good morning.","Richard Eastman","Again, I'll definitely second all the closing comments and nice comments about Brian. He will be missed. Just a quick question around the ES&C business as well as the IT business, the incremental margins in both in the fourth quarter just exceeded the gross margin that those two businesses generate. And I'm curious, is that a mix issue in those two segments? Or how did they deliver that amount of leverage I guess?","Rob Crisci","Yeah. I mean, I think in the energy segment, you had 1% growth. So that's just sort of a small number since you asked. I think in the industrial businesses, look there is \u2013 we do have high contribution margins and so as you get late in the year and you're delivering a lot of product it's going to come through a pretty high contribution margin. So, certainly over time, it\u2019s not going to be a 100%, but certainly for a quarter, you can have pretty strong incrementals.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Okay. And just I guess this is kind of plays into my second question here. Again, when I look at 2019 and I look at core guide of 3% to 5% for sales, if I add back the $0.25 that you have pulled out for Gatan and other imaging businesses I'm curious about the EBIT leverage you will be able to show for the year. Again, if I just add that back the EBIT leverage looks a lot like maybe 3% type of thing. So, I'm a little bit curious, if in your plan assuming Gatan and imaging businesses is most of the compounding effect in EBIT going to come from M&A this year with your guide around industrial businesses? Is that kind of how your plan picks up?","Rob Crisci","Yes, sure, yes. As you know, we don't include any acquisitions in guide. So this guide is strictly based-off of organic. We've got a lot of capital that we expect to deploy as long as the right opportunities are there. And so, at the end of the year, yes, the compounding will always be a combination of our organic growth and our M&A growth.","In terms of the guide, we are assuming roughly 30% to 35% leverage on the growth overall, which is pretty consistent with the kind of long-term trends. I think as Neil mentioned in our base guidance, because we are assuming some declines in some of the upstream businesses, and there's going to be a little bit of delevering there and it will hurt you, whereas the software and the medical businesses generally leverage 40%. And so if you put it all together, you get something in the 30s for our baseline midpoint guidance, which we think is sort of a prudent approach at this point in time.","Richard Eastman","I see. Yeah, yeah. And then just last question, around Gatan, is there any chance you would share kind of that revenue forecast for 2019? I mean, I understand when you're taking it out, but as the numbers would suggest that Gatan kind of decelerates off of what apparently was a really good 2018? Is that correct and...?","Rob Crisci","Yeah. So I don't really want to get that specific on that, given the fact that we're currently trying to get it to closed, the regulatory. But I would say that from a seasonality standpoint, it's always stronger in the second half than in the first half. So I think it is true, we're not assuming a lot of growth in 2019 versus what was a very strong 2018.","Richard Eastman","I see. Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.","Rob Crisci","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. ","Tristan Margot","Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. Neil, just a quick one. I was wondering if you changed anything this year in the way Roper sets its guidance, since really that was the first time you had to do this at the entire company level. I guess what I'm trying to get to is how conservative though your guidance is this year compared to the previous years.","Neil Hunn","Well, I'll give you a little bit of a process and turn over to Rob. Maybe he can add some color. So the process of setting this is the same process that we've gone through for the last four or five years. I've certainly been involved with it, but not at the helm, obviously. So the engagement with the company is going through all the plan reviews, doing the call downs in January, doing all the analytics, getting the market information. So it's the same process. I went through earlier about the \u2013 what the posture we're taking on our oil and gas businesses relative to Q1 and the outlook. So we believe if the market, the takeaway capacity comes online or oil prices stay where they are or go up, there could be some positive levers. But other than that it's generally the same approach. Rob, do you want to add?","Rob Crisci","Yeah. It's the exact same process we've done over the last 10 years. So we certainly view it as well-balanced.","Tristan Margot","Great. Thank you, guys.","Neil Hunn","Great. Thank you.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you, everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Our revenue actually was modestly up from last year at $886 million and our book-to-bill was 101 and above almost everywhere, with the exception of RF, which is of course project driven.","Growth was led by Medical, which was up 12% in revenue and RF Technology, which was up 6% in revenue. The declines that we saw in industrial and energy were virtually exactly as we had modeled. FX was about a 3% headwind in the quarter, and that result was a bit of negative organic, as you can see it was about 2% with those industrial and energy headwinds.","Gross margins were spectacular, they were up 130 basis points to 60.7% over last year, and even up sequentially from the second quarter. EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points to 34.4, both records. Net earnings were up 4% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus our guidance of $1.53 to $1.57.","Our free cash flow was $220 million, which was up sharply from the second quarter's $162 million and the $220 million of free cash flow represents 137% conversion. We deployed $435 million in three acquisitions, RF Ideas, Atlantic Health Partners and On Center, which we have discussed earlier, and we just completed the Aderant acquisition on Wednesday, which was $675 million net of tax benefit acquisition, we will talk more about this morning, and today we are announcing two more transactions, CliniSys and Atlas Medical. So it was really an outstanding quarter and of course great capital deployment for us. ","Next slide; if you look at the income statement, we are sort of laughing, because it\u2019s the old story about the ducks on the pond and they are moving along nicely, but underneath, these are moving wildly. Lots of activity, but at the end of the day, we are up $1 million, but you got to know, that that's in the face of oil and gas being down about 3% of our entire revenue, and FX about 3% and of course, the City of Toronto roll-up, another one, so we had to overcome quite a bit of headwinds and still produce positive results.","Our gross margin was up from 59.4 a year ago to 60.7 and it really demonstrates the quality of our businesses, because even in these difficult markets, they not only are holding our gross margins, but oftentimes, increasing them.","If you look at the operating margin, it too shows incredible execution, 27.9% a year ago and 28.7% this year, up 80 basis points, despite having quite a bit of M&A expense we took in during the quarter for all this activity. You can see that tax rate was 30.4, which was a little bit lower than last year's 31.3, but I'd remind you, our second quarter it was only 25.7, so there was a $0.12 headwind relative to Q2 on the tax rate, and the tax rate gives about $0.02 favorable in the quarter. And then you can see the DEPS at $1.61.","The compounding of cash flow, if there is any theme around here, it would be that. We are in base, a compounder. You can see our cash flow -- operating cash flow is going up from $579 million during the first three quarters of last year, at $660 million now. Operating cash flow conversion was 141%. Our free cash flow conversion was 137%, and while we always ask people to look at, even though we don't report on a cash earnings per share basis, if you take a look here at our revenue, free cash flow, you will see that 25% of our revenue turned into free cash flow in the quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 15% over last year at $632 million, and we still do think cash is the best measure relative to performance.","We continue to look at the balance sheet and our asset velocity. You will see that, we have improved another 160 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of this year. Everything is better, inventory is down, receivables are down, payables are up, and so the net effect as we go from 5.8% at the end of the third quarter last year to 4.2% now and our governance process just continues to drive the working capital focus for every one here throughout the unit.","Next slide; we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with very strong balance sheet. We had $700 million in cash, while its outside of the U.S. of course, an undrawn revolver, giving us sort of cash and undrawn revolver capacity of about $1.6 billion, and our gross net number you can see there is at about $2.8 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is about $1.239 billion, that's not pro forma, that's just the actual number, pro forma would be higher, of course with our acquisitions, giving us a gross debt-to-EBITDA profile of about 2.3. Our pipeline opportunities are still really quite good, so we are going to continue to see acquisitions flowing here in 2016. We are rapidly getting to the point, where we are going to have $1 billion of cash flow very soon on an annual basis, and of course, we tend to reinvest that at about 1.3 or 1.5 times that cash flow. So we still look forward to another $1.5 billion or so of investment opportunity next year.","The Aderant transaction of course is going to be around $695 million in terms of the cash cost of that, so that will take up the rest of our revolver, and as a result, we have upsized the revolver from its $1.5 billion to $1.850 billion, and the CliniSys transaction will be basically funded out of non-U.S. cash, so there is no new borrowing required. So it gives us a very strong balance sheet.","Here we just have a placeholder before we start talking about our segment deal and the outlook.","Next slide; if you look at the performance of all four of the segments, they continue to be just marvelous. I mean, here you are with these headwinds and currency challenges and everything else in energy, and yet our EBITDA margins in the quarter were 33%. Our Industrial Technology, which is only about 10% effective by oil and gas, still had 31% EBITDA margins, while RF had 36% and Medical 45. So all of these segments have just incredible margins, and if you think about it from a historical perspective, going back to look, just to 2011, not very long ago, our collective EBITDA is up about 580 basis points since the third quarter of 2011. And also, you want to remember, when we report EBITDA, almost all of our D&A is really just non-cash amortization, and unlike depreciation, that non-cash amortization has no call on future capital spending. Also, you can see Medical and RF are still over two-thirds of our total EBITDA.","Next slide. So we look at the smaller segment, Energy Systems and Controls, we went into the year saying that about 60% of that segment would be in oil and gas, and that's actually going to be slightly less than that, just due to the sales, but notwithstanding that, we had a lot of FX exposure in energy with a lot of non-U.S. activity, so FX was a negative 5% headwind in the quarter. The oil and gas markets, were about as weak as we expected, in fact, when you look back about how they performed versus how we model them, there was literally no variance.","The other served markets were flat with a few modest exceptions that were up. We had really terrific margin performance, as every body executed very nimbly, terrific deleverage performance and the operating margin is actually up 60 basis points from a year ago, and I think notably, its up 330 basis points from what we reported in the second quarter. So we have gone from 26% OP margin to 29.3% sequentially, on effectively the same revenue. So that's quite an accomplishment, and I think those -- everybody in this segment, for the most part, deserves a lot of credit for that.","When we look at it, it's trending into Q4, what we would see is sort of the same level of weakness, but some incremental improvement, just because of some seasonal programs that tend to occur inside Energy. But with Energy being less than one in every $7 of revenue, it won't have a big effect for us.","We had strong growth in our nuclear test business on improving market conditions. There is a good deal of activity that's emerging, both in China and Korea based opportunity in the Middle East, and startups again in Japan for their nuclear activity. So that's going to be a material improvement for us in the fourth quarter, and into 2016. The cost actions that we took earlier this year, you can see, have already improved our margins here in the third quarter, and we expect the margins to improve still a bit more into the fourth quarter of this year.","Next slide; the industrial technology segment, which is about 10% oil and gas by the way, a little less in this quarter, it had a 4% hit on FX. We also have, in the industrial technology segment, the City of Toronto roll off from Neptune, which we said this year, would be in the neighborhood of $40 million or about $8 million to $9 million a quarter, and that's about what it was in this quarter. So that's most of the organic issue.","Neptune, on the other hand grew mid-single digits, excluding the completion of the Toronto, so we were pleased with that. Our oil and gas markets were almost exactly as we expected them in here, but the margins remain really strong, when you think about the challenges that those folks had. They could have done a little better job on deleveraging, and we have talked to them about that, and I think we will see better performance in that respect in the fourth quarter. We continue to have growth in our Material Analysis businesses and they are holding up very well, given their European and Asian exposure.","In the fourth quarter, we have already announced, as of October 2nd, that we completed the divestiture of Abel Pumps; that was a business that we sold for \u20ac95 million. It has very strong fourth quarter, so the buyer would be benefited by that, we had it projected in our guidance at about $14 million in revenue and about $0.03 a share of earnings, which of course, now goes away. On the other hand, we get \u20ac95 million and have already effectively reinvested that money in the acquisitions we have just made in higher margin businesses that don't require the assets that Abel was going to require to sustain its growth.","Oil and gas is still weak, but growth in the other markets is pretty good and is offsetting for the most part, the oil and gas weakness. We do think in the fourth quarter, we will have better margins, with better leverage performance.","Next slide; we look here at RF Technology. We were up, as you can see, 6% of revenue and up 10% in operating profit. If you look at that operating margin at 30.3% up 120 basis points, I want to remind us that the EBITDA margin in this segment is 35.7. So we have a lot of non-cash amortization and the 35.7 number demonstrates just how powerful the cash earnings profile of the RF Technology segment is. Organic revenue was up 4, FX was a 1% headwind, the growth continued in our Infinity Lane Systems, both in Florida and Texas and we have a number of quotations out, so that looks very favorable, as we go into next year.","We had quite reasonable subscriber editions in our various Freight Matching businesses that supported growth in the quarter, and then we acquired RF IDeas in September, and that business has historically grown at double digits, and we certainly expect that that will be the case in the future; both Rick and Craig who are driving that business, have been there a long time. They have created an unbelievable value-added reseller network and terrific direct connectivity with OEMs. Primarily, the business provides proprietary card reading technology, so we can think of it -- doing for the individual, what Neptune reader technology does for a big collective entity. Lots of identification and authenticity ID that they have -- a lot of it is for single sign-on things like printers. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications and thousands of customers, its quite a decent balance sheet, as you might imagine, as our deals are.","If we look to the fourth quarter, the software business, as we think will continue to grow at mid-single digits. We will get great leverage out of them and terrific cash flow performance. The backlog and proposal activity that we have at tolling traffic is pretty good. We don't see any slowing in that arena, and we will finally get done with a couple of projects, which have been -- things that have been challenging, to say the least, that it will be behind us, and that's really good news. And then, we will have very strong segment margin performance, we think, continuing, led by our SaaS and application software businesses.","Last Wednesday, we completed the acquisition of Aderant. Aderant is really an incredible company, if we turn the slide here, we can look at a detailed exploration of Aderant. In a sense, its just a great business. It has lots of complementary notes that have come to us from various admirers of Aderant and Chris Giglio's team is -- I think we have never had as many unsolicited inbound notes about what a great business this is, and thank goodness its finally in the home of a public company, that will continue to invest and there has been an amount of fear, maybe unwarranted, but nonetheless, very real for law firms, who I am sure, wouldn't shock you that they tend to be somewhat conservative, who were not too happy to see Aderant in the hands of private equity previously, and it always makes people worry about, whether they can depend on continued internal development and growth.","Aderant has a really end-to-end platform of mission critical software, that primarily goes to law firms now, but could be expanded to other professional services organizations. It has 3,000 of the world's largest law firms and professional services organizations, and they really do a full suite of activity, all the way from time capturing and billing to docketing. They are in Atlanta, they have got a great software business also in Auckland, New Zealand, which we were very encouraged by. We think they are going to generate over $125 million in revenue in 2016 and beyond, and of course, it is as always, a high margin business.","If you look at our acquisition criteria on the right, you will see it has got an excellent management team. In fact, we are retaining everyone. So that's a checked box [ph] high recurring revenue yet, you can check that box, over 95% customer retention. Strong cash flow characteristics, asset life, well once again, negative working capital, so people pay us in advance for work that we are going to eventually perform. Very deep domain experience inside -- in terms of people who are accustomed and used to working with law firms and what their needs really are, and it has multiple growth opportunities, including opportunities to do additional acquisitions at Aderant, which is one of the things that we have been so encouraged by these last three larger transactions in the form of Sunquest, which you see us doing continual bolt-ons to and MHA, which we continue to do, and now Aderant, which is the third largest acquisition that we have made, will have a very strong forward opportunity to continue to add businesses to this very good platform. So another great niche software business for us.","Next slide; if you look at Medical Solutions, and we haven't really dropped the reference to scientific imaging. I mean, the reality is, that its no longer very material; and in the quarter, the scientific image business had about a 6% decline, all of which really was our rugged mobile business, which we have been just gradually winding down. As you recall, we sold the Black Diamond business. That was reported in RF, it had a both DAP and JLT, and these things should be pretty well cycled through before the end of the year. If it weren't for that, scientific imaging would have been flat in the quarter.","You can see that the medical businesses grew organically by about 5%, while total revenue was up 12%, because of the acquisition content. FX in the segment was 3% headwind. We had continued growth at MHA, with significant customer acquisitions, and Mike Sicilian and his team were able to acquire Atlantic Healthcare Partners, which is really a vaccine GPO, but it gives us a new channel direct to physician offices. It will contribute meaningfully to our EBITDA in 2016, and it is a terrific acquisition and so congratulations to Mike and Jason Connelly and others there.","Our recurring revenue increased at Sunquest, which was a good sign. We really do believe, Sunquest is going to be positioned for a strong 2016, and everything that we have seen, as we continue to do these acquisitions, we will talk about the second, suggests we are putting together quite impressive platform of opportunities over a long period of time at Sunquest.","Our medical devices business were quite stronger than by new product introductions and the execution around introducing those, at both Verathon and Northern Digital, those certainly outperforming the rest of our medical product businesses. Our recent acquisitions that we have done this year, all of which are performing above our internal plans for how they would do. ","We signed an agreement just sort of virtually within the last couple of days to acquire CliniSys Group U.K., it\u2019s a leading provider of hospital laboratory software, and so just think about it basically as being the Sunquest of Europe. It has sort of an elongated customary merger control review process that will happen in the U.K. and Europe. We expect that we should be able to get that all closed out, and it ought to be inside our reporting entity by the -- maybe the end of January, or certainly early in 2016. We invested \u00a3170 million in that business, but all CliniSys will be paid for from our non-U.S. cash.","In the fourth quarter, we think we will continue to have kind of like mid-single digit organic growth in the medical businesses. But we think those margins will continue, as incredible as they are today; and once again, you will look at the op margin, where we reported 36.6, but remember, that the EBITDA margin is 45%. So lots of non-cash detractors on the op margin can confuse people about how great and powerful these businesses are on a cash earnings basis.","We continue to have outstanding margin and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter. Our Atlas Medical acquisition, which literally we finished yesterday, will also expand our laboratory connectivity. This is really an amazing business that has been developed by founder Rob Atlas, who is extremely well known in the hospital arena, and Rob will be joining the Sunquest team. Atlas Medical, whose business will really be a bolt-on for Sunquest, but it provides a support mechanism to both Sunquest and Data Innovations.","Connectivity Solutions are basically thinking about the lab to the physician outreach that a hospital would have, and then within the hospital, the concept of lab-to-lab communication, where oftentimes, people can't see the data they want, it results in unnecessary additional tests. We like the whole concept of coordinated diagnostics inside the hospital. We really believe that this gives us a pretty eminent edge over what other people do in this category, and over time, you will hear us talk more and more about Sunquest and Atlas as a combination.","Next slide; here we will look at the guidance for the year. Next slide; we updated our guidance -- actually raised the guidance for the full year, to $6.69 to $6.75. Previously, it was $6.61 to $6.75, so this moves the midpoint up from $6.68 to $6.72, so it\u2019s a $0.04 a share increase. But remember, this is despite Abel leaving and Abel will cost us $0.03, maybe $0.04 during that. So if we had not sold Abel, we would have raised the high end a little more, but we have to absorb that offset.","And again, when you look at the cash conversion, this third quarter, it was 137% cash conversion for the year, certainly shouldn't exceed 130%, so the DEPS number is one thing, but the cash performance is quite much more important. We also raised our operating cash flow target to between $9.25 to $9.40 for the full year, and that's another projected increase from what we have suggested in the past, and CapEx is not running very high this year, less than $40 million, so its going to promote a lot of free cash flow.","Next slide; so we go to the summary here for the third quarter, really a record quarter, despite the headwind. So not sure, we could have expected to do as well as we did, but we are quite pleased with the performance. Book-to-bill at 1.01 is a good sign for the fourth quarter, and gross margins reaching 50.7. I went back to look at where we were in the third quarter in 2011, and we were at 53.7% gross margin, so we have added 700 basis points to our gross margins in the last four years here, in the third quarter. Our operating margin is 28.7%, and our EBITDA margin is 34.4; and if you go back to the third quarter of 2011, you will see EBITDA was about 28.6, and now its 34.4.","Our DEPS, $1.61 exceeded our guidance. Free cash flow, 25% of our revenue and 137% conversion. Full year DEPS raised and cash flow guidance raised; we deployed $435 million in three terrific acquisitions, and then, just as we began this quarter, we acquired Aderant, our third largest transaction in our history, and yesterday, signed an agreement to acquire Atlas Medical. So we were able to confirm everything we thought that would happen in the fourth quarter, and really believe we are very well positioned to have a record 2016, but we won't provide guidance around that until we report earnings in January.","So with that, John, I think we are ready for opening up to questions.","John Humphrey","So Wes, I think we are ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning guys.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey Brian, as you further expand into software right, we are in medical, now we are adding legal, and you mentioned the ability to go into potentially other professional services. I mean, is there any eventual barrier where a certain industry has some level of domain expertise, where you guys couldn't acquire and succeed with the software business like this in that industry? Maybe just a little understanding of why can you succeed in legal or why could you take this to other areas and is there ultimately somewhere you couldn't go?","Brian Jellison","Well I think that, we are always funded by these niche transactions, right, so we don't want to go into some situation, where people are going to write software off of our software. We are really providing some kind of service to somebody, we happen to be using software to achieve the benefit of what it is. But you have to have domain experience. So our guys at the core are software people, they are domain experts who use software to create a solution for somebody, that's efficient and effective for them.","So as long as we continue to see things that are in those spaces, we will be able to make the acquisitions. Couple of sessions ago, I said, when we did Sunquest and we did MHA, they were really-really as important for the future of Roper Technologies, as Neptune and Transcore back in 2003 and 2004 for Roper Industries.","Sunquest and MHA gives us world class leadership organizations, that allow us to do bolt-on acquisitions and things that are complementary to them, and most of what we have done this year, has something to do with one or the other of those organizations.","Aderant is similarly positioned to do that. It\u2019s a great organization. You can go back and look at Chris Giglio, he did a YouTube video on the day of the acquisition, that was just brilliant and you can see how he is expressing the fact that now being owned by a public company, his customers could have confidence that they will get the continued investment for his program to continue to become the most important player in that area.","So we are always kind of agnostic about what it is the business does. So we don't really have a boundary around the business, as long as it hits the excellent magic high recurring revenue, great cash flow, prefer to have few, if any, assets and domain experience, then we are pretty wide open on where we would deploy our capital.","Now, we also have some internal things, we always want to be able to add value to the business in some meaningful way that we can understand, and we want to think that people working our government system will perform better than they were, when they weren't in it. And if we think, in our diligence process that, neither of those would happen, then we would abandon the deal.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. That helps. And then, on some of the pressure against the -- or the performances amidst the oil and gas pressure, you talked about the sequential margin improvement that you got in energy, but a little less happy with the margin performance in industrial tech in the quarter. Can you just talk about the differences in terms of -- maybe just basic blocking and tackling of costs out, or maybe just a little bit more on what drove that and what you expect to improve in the fourth quarter?","Brian Jellison","Well I think that, what we got out of deleveraging and energy was more traditional, in the sort of 30-35, 38% type of stuff that we saw in most of the businesses. We didn't think that upstream guys in oil and gas and industrial, which by the way, was less than 10% of our revenue. They delevered it more than 50%, which we though was unacceptable, and we have shared that with them [ph].","So they were moving pretty quickly, but they haven't been as used to that kind of change, because they have been driven really by the fracking opportunity, and there really wasn't any cyclical uptick -- it always has gone up, they have never really gone back for a long period of time, and they just didn't do quite as good a job as quickly, as the energy people did. But that problems are behind us.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great, thanks guys.","Brian Jellison","You have the City of Toronto cycling through, so that's an $8 million or $9 million negative income thing, which isn't useful.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Right. Got it. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","We will take the next question from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Brian Jellison","Good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","I'd like to stay on the oil side of the business for a moment, and you mentioned that in the energy segment, you were expecting to see some cost savings benefits flow through, as well as fourth quarter, seeing some seasonal benefits. I was hoping you could provide some color there?","Brian Jellison","Well usually, you get -- typically, our Petroleum Analyzer business will get and [indiscernible]. They get fourth quarter seasonal activity, that is oftentimes MRO that's left over. These things we have are really not capital sales, and so they have every year, even -- I think, now every year they have an increase in the fourth quarter. So that will just give us a little bit more revenue in Q4 than we enjoyed in Q3, and with that, get a little bit better margin. They have been very nimble in responding, I don't know John, if you want to add anything to that?","John Humphrey","Yeah I mean, what I would tell you is that we are expecting some sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. Not as much as what we have seen in the past, in terms of the dollar increase. If you look back at kind of how this segment has performed in 2012, and 2013, and 2014, well we tried to add a nice jump up there. We are expecting some, but not as much as in the past, just because of the other headwinds that are present in new oil and gas markets.","Deane Dray","And how about the cost savings benefits?","John Humphrey","The cost savings benefit will continue to just manifest itself most of the costs out would happen in the first half. And so that, that flowthrough just continues in the fourth quarter against last year cost levels.","Brian Jellison","I do think, from a read-across [ph] basis, everybody believes there [indiscernible] of what they are seeing from a revenue viewpoint. We went through our quarterly review process and people certainly didn't have any optimism for the fourth quarter, but they all though things should pretty well bottomed out, and they were feeling better about Q4 than they did in Q3, and we don't yet have their forecast for 2016, but in the verbal discussions, people feel a little bit better.","So the good news for us, is its getting to be such a small portion of the enterprise, that it doesn't have much effect, as you can see here. Because upstream is probably down 35% this year, and even with that kind of drag, we had record revenue and record cash and earnings performance in the quarter.","Deane Dray","Thanks. And just to follow-up on Aderant, did you disclose what the growth has been for Aderant and the renewal rates?","Brian Jellison","The renewal -- we said retention was about 95%. I don't think we have said a lot about growth. But its going through a little bit of a growth spur, as its gaining share against its primary competitor, who has got some issues. They will have to deal with terms of the software that supports their system historically.","John Humphrey","And also remember that this is another business that has a substantial install base, so you get a lot of maintenance revenue, right. So this is not a SaaS business. They have a small SaaS offering, which we think has very interesting prospects. But the majority of this business is a traditional license and maintenance model, and so when you talk about what's the growth rate -- the underlying growth rate of the ongoing maintenance, which is kind of in the low single digit range, but then you have the upside opportunity, as well as what they are capturing today, which is new share and new applications, which is growing much faster than that. So you blend it all together and it has a similar to Sunquest, kind of in the mid to high single digit, is what we expect of this business going forward.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Davis at Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning guys.","Brian Jellison","Good morning Scott.","Scott Davis","I have been following your stock for a long time. I don't think I remember a time period where you have had such a flurry of deals and pretty attractive stuff on the surface at least. But talk to us a little bit about what would you attribute that to? I mean, sometimes maybe these things work out in the timing. But is there an acceleration on part of sponsors to try to pare some assets off their books at this time, and you're benefiting from that?","Brian Jellison","I think that might be the case more so in the next 18 months than it has been in the last 18 months. There has been a lot of stuff for sale, but there is always a lot of stuff in the pipeline. But I do think you are starting to see the signs of people getting worried about -- to get any kind of uptick on the risk premium around CCC credits and financing. People are going to start to worry about their exit multiples versus what their entrance multiples order. So I think everybody is wondering about what their exit time ought to be, if it should be moved up. But boy, the guys that we work with and talk to all the time, I mean, they are still deploying capital like crazy. So you see them making big bets and the launch of [indiscernible] very high trailing multiples at least, for what they hope will be able to grow into.","So I don't think that there was anything particularly unusual, I think that we have owned Sunquest long enough, that we have a real purposeful strategy about what we are building out there, that's just starting to be able to be seen. We are still going to tell everybody exactly what we are doing. But when you look back and you see what we have done with data acquisitions and with strategic healthcare partners for MHA and Atlantic Healthcare. For MHa, and what we are doing here with CliniSys and what we are doing with Atlas, a couple of years from now I think people will -- we won't ever get another question about what ring counts look like.","Scott Davis","Understood. And just to follow-up -- and I understand that's business as well. But you talked about CliniSys being kind of the Sunquest of Europe. I mean, is the product offering comparable enough that you could consider merging these two entities or having commonality in management or any kind of synergies that would be not traditional or less traditional for Roper?","Brian Jellison","Well the problem of course is the U.K. health system, right. So Germany is different, U.K. is different. So there are regionally specific regulated industries that require different kinds of performance criteria versus what Sunquest faces in the U.S. There certainly will be synergies in the sense of improving our software development capability for those entities, and that's good. I can see, John's anxious to add too.","John Humphrey","Yeah I don't think there is any -- in fact, I know there is no plan to merge those things. What we do see is the opportunity for these businesses to work together, to bring new solutions to the market. There are kind of similar unmet needs and opportunities to do things, whether its around blood bank or other solutions. So there may be opportunities for the two businesses to work together in the future. But as far as the core offering, its very-very niche and kind of purpose built, and we don't expect those things to have any overlap.","Scott Davis","Fair enough. Thanks good luck guys. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Brian Jellison","Good morning Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So, you guys operated really well this quarter, despite organic growth turning negative, and I guess I am just trying to parse out some of the comments for 4Q and beyond. Do you guys see the third quarter as a trough in your organic growth? And as you kind of think about 2016, clearly, there are some headwinds this year, with energy, the Toronto Project, tough software comps and Sunquest. I am just trying to get a sense for just general comments across your portfolio on your organic growth in 2016?","Brian Jellison","Well I think 2016 is going to be a lot easier for us, because the headwinds that we faced this year should all subside. So I don't think that oil and gas would be worse in 2016 in a material way than it has been in 2015. Its likely to be stable or perhaps up a little bit on some of the areas.","I think our fourth quarter will be kind of similar to the third quarter, but 2016 is a different story. So we are going to enjoy some of the acquisitions that we have made, will become organic in 2016 and that always helps. So just about everything is favorable. In 2016, you get rid of the City of Toronto drag, which, to bear, we get rid of the Rugged Mobile kind of winding, that has been down. We do get rid of a lot of drags. And so organic, these will be more favorable next year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. That's helpful Brian. And maybe on my follow-up, it seems like this year you have been a little bit more apt to take a look at your portfolio, little bit closer with the divestitures of both Black Diamond and Abel. I am just curious, whether you guys are -- as you think over the next couple of years, will there be continued portfolio pruning as you continue to become more of a software type entity?","Brian Jellison","Well, we still love our cash generation businesses out there. They don't have any amortization. I don't know, maybe one of these days, we are going to report it on our cash earnings. It would be a different story. But man, the EPS we get out of our historical business is pretty spectacular, 33% EBITDA and fluid handling. Its hard to bind something with 33% EBITDA, right. So these businesses are really great. We think they are valued pretty highly inside our overall portfolio. I think people approach us -- I mean, our phone rang off the hook, when people saw -- we sold Abel, everybody in the world is calling us up about, hey can we buy your pump businesses, can we buy your energy business, can we do this, can we do that? And the answer is no. I mean, what are you talking about, you guys traded at a multiple that's lower than the imputed value on our business. And if we are going to do it, then we are going to do it for shareholders, so that shareholders get a premium to what they would be.","So I do think there are creative things that people kind approach us on, and I was willing to listen to various things, but we like the businesses that we own today, for the most part.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks Brian. Helpful color.","Operator","We will take the next question from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning. I will resist the temptation to cease this leading [ph] opportunity to ask about rate comps [ph]. Speaking with energy, you did have a really dramatic sequential improvement on flat revenues with margin there, so just wonder if there are any trade-offs with that kind of material, really bring up some margin upside? And then how to think about, what that says about the leverage or the margin performance, as those markets actually return?","Brian Jellison","All good news. As they -- let us know when they are going to return by the way, we are not aware of that yet, Chris. But if they do come back, we will be printing money there. There is no question about that. We are already printing money in a hideous market. So yeah, that's all good news. But there is a little bit of a loss [indiscernible] numbers. The difference I think, if you look at the op and energy in the second quarter, and the op and the energy in the third quarter, we are up about $4 million in operating profit quarter-over-quarter on the same revenue. So you get sort of a nice kick there.","John Humphrey","And also Chris -- so structural. So the structural piece of these businesses, is the fact that they have a highly variable cost structure. So we don't have a lot of fixed costs that are hard and expensive and time consuming to take out, and then also, hard and expensive and time consuming to put back in. So these are primarily people related expenses, and so I don't expect that to be structural from that standpoint. Its flexible, and that's the important thing for those businesses, and to make sure that they are able to flex very quickly with volume decreases, but also be able to capture opportunities when volume comes back.","Christopher Glynn","Makes sense. Great. Thanks.","Operator","We will get next to Jeffrey Sprague at Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","I just wanted to circle back to kind of the deal activity again. A lot of moving pieces there. First, just to help us get our head around everything? Can you just kind of square us up? I am sure you don't want to go through every deal individually, but collectively, the $1.7 billion you're spending here in 2015, kind of what the combined EBITDA multiple might be or the run rate revenues from this basket of deals?","Brian Jellison","Well, we get some tax benefits in there, but on balance, I'd say, our purchase price for these things has been around 11 times, first year EBITDA. So you can kind of use that as a guidepost into what we would expect for next year.","Jeffrey Sprague","Net of revenue?","John Humphrey","In terms of revenue, for our first 12 months of ownership for all of that, right? So the first 12 months for Strata and SoftWriters and Data Innovations is largely in our numbers this year. But when we add all of that up, we get to something in the $375 million range.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a -- actually just a quick modeling question, John, has the tax rate got a downward bias here, is that part of the guidance construct in the Q4?","John Humphrey","Not really. Probably 31% or something like that into the fourth quarter, right? 31.5. But its hard to feel you have a downward bias, when you pay our tax rates. We are not in aversion, we just don't have any kind of things that are going on around the world. So our tax rate, pretty much for the year, if you look back historically, its going to be around 29% to 30% most of the time.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right. And then just one other one, Brian, I totally get your point on the industrial businesses, right, they get a Roper multiple instead of some other multiple, which makes it difficult to exit and you got a lot of cash you can deploy. But can you just give us a little bit of additional color on why Abel and why that might be different from the others and how you will be looking at this thing; because I am sure, you do have an open mind around value over time. What's just kind of the overall thought process there?","Brian Jellison","So Abel is really unique. In terms of the pumping technology it uses, it is unrelated to what we do at Cornell and its unrelated to what we do at Roper, which are our other two pump businesses. So it really offers us no surges of any kind, from a technological development viewpoint. The PP&E that's used to generate an Abel pump, these are really large. They are more like Flowserve or Dresser-Rand or something like that, or just totally -- typically in large test facilities, mostly witness tests. A lot of their growth, which should be quite good, will be in India, related to power generation. So the end markets that they serve, we are going to require additional capital deployment for us, to continue to grow those businesses. And it wasn't the place we felt like we should invest, therefore, we really felt that that would be better, if we cut this loose to somebody who is seeing it as a growth platform, which it can become. I think it\u2019s a good acquisition for the people that bought it, and I think it will perform quite well for them. But we are able to get out if it at \u20ac95 million and, would be hard pressed to say, sort of 12 times trailing number was something we should turn down.","Jeffrey Sprague","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good morning, Brian, John, Rob.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning.","Richard Eastman","Brian, a quick question. TransCore has had some really nice wins, recently in Massachusetts, Central Florida. There has also been some commentary about Saudi Arabia and the Riyadh, maybe dialing down the metro spend in Riyadh. And I am just curious, when you sit through all that and put the wins there, with potential -- a little bit of softness in Riyadh, how does that business look over the next 12 months? Is the backlog support -- comfortably support a mid-single digit growth rate for TransCore?","Brian Jellison","Yeah. I think so. I mean, its cyclical up and down in terms of projects, its not sort of cyclical with the economy, but we are certainly not seeing any slowness. In Riyadh, they are expanding the project. Somebody said to me I think this morning, oh my goodness, Saudi Arabia, they need to borrow money, they want a bit of cash, they can't do any of that. I mean, wow, people do react on a lot of various things. I do not think Saudi Arabia is going out of business in the next month and a half, and I don't think Riyadh is either. So this is a multiyear contract, and once you have the work deployed, people have to have the backroom operations, they can't do it on their own. So there is a lot of different things that happen. Now this is mostly a traffic translink project, with a lot of upfront opportunity that's more civil engineering, and as that gets behind us, then actually margins will improve.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then again, with the wins, it seems like most of that is incremental in new wins, so you have to feel pretty comfortable about the business then?","Brian Jellison","We have ample opportunities to go through with TransCore and the rest of our businesses to see what the next 12 months or the next three years looks like, and we will be able to share that totality of that picture at the fourth quarter, when we initiate guidance for 2016. So I mean, just taking out one piece, yeah, we feel very good about that. But wait for the whole picture.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then, can I also just ask you internally, with Atlantic and mHA and all the conversations going on around generic pricing on the drug side, what have been the internal discussions there on the price component at those two GPOs? It sounds like you had some new customer wins here, which is really a positive, but any internal discussions around this generic pricing issue, and the impact, positive or negative it could have on those two businesses?","Brian Jellison","I mean so far, it has been modestly positive. But I would say that we are not in those conversations. We don't set prices, we help our members negotiate the best pricing and the best supply chain solutions that they can obtain. So it has been modestly helpful, but not by any stretch, is it the largest piece of the MHA growth that we have experienced.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Nice work and congrats on the quarter.","Brian Jellison","Thank you.","Operator","We will take the next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Joe Giordano","I had a question on CliniSys and maybe if you can help frame that market generally. You have your positioning in Sunquest kind of niche in the United States and then CliniSys you said is the Sunquest of Europe type property. Maybe, some color on how many -- if we look globally, what does this market look like, how many major players of that kind of size really are there?","Brian Jellison","Here is a situation, we just signed the agreement. When we are filing-- a lot of material like, either we do here with HSR, so that's all going into customary merger control reviews. So we have agreed with the seller, that we are not going to provide any information until after the deal closes. So I can't tell you a lot about that. But the end markets are quite similar to what happens here in the United States, the hospitals. While people think that there is universal healthcare in the U.K., there is actually a wide variety of potential providers that side that system, and CliniSys allows these people to have a uniform operated platform around all the things that go on, lapse. And we will be able to make them be more efficient for the healthcare system, because they will now get access to our Data Innovations technology and they will get access to some of the ways we do things at Sunquest. So we think from an end user viewpoint, the owner who has built this very good business in the U.K. and recently acquired business similar to it -- and Germany will benefit from providing additional services and clarity to the people that use hoar [ph] system to try it in laboratories.","So we are bullish about that, but that's about as far as I can go, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Fair enough. You mentioned a slight strength in the materials analysis and industrial tech, and I am just trying to get a sense of how much is that market dynamic or how much is that unique to your businesses there? Maybe we can touch on that for a second?","John Humphrey","Its probably about 50-50. As you see global industrial production, whether that's around steel or automobile, so that is -- Joe we have got a little bit of positive tailwind. But you also have a lot of new and upgraded products and the expansion of Struers' global reach, and so it puts them in a very good position to continue to take some share. And we also have a very good line of other things, not just on the material analysis, their traditional area, but also some new things around hardness testing and some things they are introducing there, that has helped them. So it\u2019s a little bit of both, little bit of market, little bit of self-help.","Joe Giordano","Great. And then just lastly, one quick housekeeping one; are you guys having any impact of Aderant in the fourth quarter guidance that you put up?","John Humphrey","Sure.","Joe Giordano","Like on an adjusted level, you have adjusted accretion in there?","John Humphrey","Yes. I mean, it will help us out by a couple of pennies.","Joe Giordano","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","John Humphrey","You're welcome.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Okay. Well thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you again in late January.","Operator","And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Morgan","Operator","The Roper Technologies\u2019 Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey.","Zack Moxcey","Good morning. And thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and year primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.","For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; and lastly, a gain on sale related to the divestiture of Gatan.","And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, we'll start with our fourth quarter consolidated highlights. We'll then turn to discuss our Q4 results on a segment basis. I'll then turn the call over to Rob to review our full year financial results. Then I'll walk us through the full year details and next year's outlook on a segment-by-segment basis followed by our consolidated full year and Q1 2020 guidance. I'll conclude with a brief summary prior to turning the call over to your questions. Next slide, please.","Q4 for Roper was a very solid quarter. Revenue grew 1% organically and came in at $1.4 billion with positive organic growth in three of our four segments and this was largely based on the strength of our software franchises, our medical product and RF product businesses and Neptune. As a partial offset to this growth, we did see our short-cycle industrial and upstream oil and gas businesses decline as expected in the quarter.","However, margin performance for the quarter was really fantastic. Gross margins grew 60 basis points to 64.1% and EBITDA grew 4% to $518 million, which represented an EBITDA margin of 37%, a record for Roper.","Also in the quarter, DEPS grew 5% and our free cash flow of $453 million was 32% of revenue. That's free cash flow of 32% of revenue for the quarter. This margin performance in the face of short-cycle industrial and oil and gas headwinds, it's a perfect proof point regarding Roper\u2019s business model. One that is comprised of niche-oriented businesses with highly variable cost structures that have aligned management teams and incentive systems that enable nimble and swift execution based on the prevailing market conditions.","Performance across the enterprise is excellent this year. I'd like to thank each of our business leaders and all of our employees worldwide for another record performance for Roper. Thank you. Also and importantly, we successfully completed the divestiture of Gatan in October of last year. In combination with the sale of the camera businesses earlier in the year and this year\u2019s $2.4 billion of capital deployment, our portfolio has been meaningfully improved to continue our long-term cash flow compounding.","Also, during the fourth quarter, we spent time with each of our businesses in person discussing their long-range strategy and focusing on where each business plays, how they will compete and win and discussing market trends, customer behaviors, and competitor activity. Then we talked to each businesses enablement and execution of strategy and conclude with a discussion regarding each of our businesses\u2019 activities regarding talent development. We are all encouraged by these planned reviews and our businesses\u2019 orientation towards investing in both product and channel opportunity to drive sustained long-term and CRI-accretive growth. Next slide, please.","Turning to our fourth quarter P&L, we saw revenues increased to $1.4 billion which was a 2% increase and 1% on an organic basis. As mentioned on the prior slide, gross margins expanded 60 basis points to 64.1% and EBITDA margins grew 100 basis points to a record 37.0% in the quarter. Finally, our DEPS grew 5%, all-in-all, a very solid quarter. Next slide, please.","As we turn to our fourth quarter segment results, I'll start with our Application Software segment. Revenues for the segment were $411 million or plus 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA came in at $164 million or 40.0% margin. We continue to see strength across the group of Application Software companies, especially at Aderant, Data Innovations and Strata. Deltek also had a strong quarter highlighted by continued double-digit, actually high teens ACV bookings growth. Revenues for Deltek were a touch light of our expectations due to a few larger GovCon prospects opting for Deltek\u2019s staff ITAR-compliant solution and a handful of perpetual opportunities sliding into 2020.","As we reported for several quarters, Deltek\u2019s growth is quite balanced across their GovCon and professional services market and the business continues to perform exceptionally well versus the competition. The segment EBITDA margin performance for this quarter was stunning, improving 190 basis points, great job by the teams.","Now turning to our network segment. We saw fourth quarter revenues increased to $431 million or an increase of 3% on an organic basis. Importantly, our software businesses in this segment grew organically 6% in the quarter and the growth was quite broad-based. As a partial offset, we saw TransCore\u2019s revenue decline a bit based on project timing associated with a few non-New York City projects. For the quarter, we saw segment EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 45.5%.","For our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment, revenues increased 1% organically to $388 million. Growth in this segment was driven with continued gains at Neptune and broadly across our medical product businesses. Neptune did a nice job clearing the majority of the backlog associated with their newer residential static water meter and our medical products businesses continued to compete and win in the marketplace. Relative to our short-cycle industrial businesses, they modestly declined in the quarter but managed margins extremely well.","And finally, as we turn to our Process Technologies segment, we saw this segment declined 6% on an organic basis with revenues of $170 million. Margin performance was quite strong, with EBITDA margins coming in at 38.7%. This quarter's segment performance was expected as we saw pressure in our upstream businesses. Also expected, CCC posted continued gains in the quarter.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated annual results. Rob?","Rob Crisci","Thanks Neil. Good morning everyone. So turning to Page 8 and looking at our full year income statement performance. Full year organic growth for 2019 was 3%, which was at the low end of our initial organic guidance against a difficult comp of 8% organic growth in 2018. Total revenue growth was also 3%. We had a one point FX headwind and also the impact of the acquisition as well as the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses and Gatan within the year. Our two segments that are primarily software, Application Software and Network Software & Systems, both finished in line with our initial guidance with mid single-digit organic growth for the year.","For our largest product segment, Measurement & Analytical Solutions, our medical products businesses, and Neptune had another very strong year of organic growth. While we did have some declines in our short-cycle industrial businesses, which lower the overall organic growth of the segment to 2% for 2019. Lastly, our smallest segment, Process Technologies declined 4% organically for the year, in line with our initial guidance and that was primarily due to the weakness in upstream oil and gas as you had expected.","As Neil mentioned for the fourth quarter, we really had outstanding margin execution by our business leaders throughout 2019, driving very strong operating leverage while we're continuing to invest for future growth.","If you look at the margins, gross margin for the year, up 70 basis points to 63.9%, EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points up to a record 35.8% and that drove 7% EBITDA growth for the year. Our tax rate was lower in 2019 at about 19%. So you add all that up, we had a double-digit adjusted DEPS growth of 10% up to $13.5 for the year so really, overall, a very strong year for Roper. Next slide.","So looking at our full year cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned in the fourth quarter, we did have $453 million of free cash flow, which is a very strong 32% of revenue. On a full year basis, we exceeded $1.5 billion, which was a 5% increase over prior year. And it's worth noting, many of you are probably on our call in January, 2017 just three years ago when we proudly announced, we had exceeded $1 billion in cash flow for the first time. Well now only three years later, we've eclipsed 1.5 billion for the first time. So at Roper, cash does remain the best measure of performance. Next slide.","So speaking of cash is the best measure of performance. The next slide is a look at our multi-year EBITDA growth and cash flow compounding. So if you look at the period from 2016 to 2019, both EBITDA and free cash flow compounded a very strong 14%. So when we think about cash conversion, a metric we like to track internally here is EBITDA to free cash flow. This seems especially relevant as investors have been moving away from P\/E towards metrics closer to cash, such as the EV\/EBITDA. However, for many companies EBITDA does not consistently convert to free cash flow at high levels. For Roper, it absolutely does.","For this period, 2016 to 2019, while our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings has been consistently well above 100% ranging from 105% to 120%. Free cash flow to EBITDA has also been very consistent between 73% and 76%. This is driven mainly by our asset-light business model with our low capital needs and negative working capital.","So as we look forward, our working capital position will continue to become more negative as you\u2019ll see on the next slide and that will further increase our ability to convert EBITDA to free cash flow at very high levels. Next slide.","So turning to the asset-light business model slide, maybe our favorite slide aided by Gatan divestiture that we completed in the quarter. We ended the year at negative 5.3% networking capital as a percentage of revenue. This record result actually includes receivables, as you can see close to 18%, which quite honestly is a little bit higher than you would normally like to see, driven largely by the timing of collections for some TransCore projects and some product revenue that came in late in the quarter.","So we certainly expect those receivables to be collected here early in 2020 and that number should improve moving forward. But even with the receivables numbers slightly higher, that negative 5.3% represents an 800 basis point improvement over the past three years, really tremendous performance in terms of working capital. And of course, the big driver of that is our deferred revenue.","Deferred revenue increased nearly $350 million over this period, driven by organic growth in our software businesses as well as our recent software acquisitions that come in at very attractive working capital levels. So in summary, from a working capital perspective at a record negative 5%, we exit the year better positioned than ever before for future cash flow compounding. Next slide.","So looking at the balance sheet, if you look at our full year results, if I look at December 2019 compared to December 2018, net debt is actually down $12 million. Now at the same time period, TTM EBITDA is up $119 million and we end the year with our gross debt-to-EBITDA at 2.7 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA at 2.4 times, largely due to the proceeds from our successful Gatan divestiture. We ended the year with a total cash balance of $710 million with approximately $400 million in the U.S. this is not the norm for us.","Now $200 million of this cash will go towards paying the Gatan taxes due in April but if you look at the cash balance, if you look at our revolver, which is now $2.5 billion revolver, fully undrawn, very attractive capital market conditions, which we took advantage of in August and certainly that, we have the capability as we move forward to access the capital market. We are incredibly well positioned to take advantage of a very high quality pipeline of acquisition opportunities in 2020.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to review our 2019 segment performance and 2020 outlook.","Neil Hunn","Thanks Rob. Let's turn to the full year 2019 highlights for our Application Software segment. For the year, revenue came in at $1.589 billion, which represented an increase of 4% on an organic basis and EBITDA was $636 million, an increase of 10% versus the prior year and EBITDA margins were 40.0%. Deltek turned in a great year.","Revenues increased mid single-digits on an organic basis and this growth was balanced across both markets, GovCon and Professional Services, as well as across the perpetual and SaaS offerings. Also during the year, Deltek\u2019s product and solution portfolio was meaningfully enhanced. On an organic basis, the company released an ITAR-compliant GovCon SaaS offering and started gaining meaningful traction with its VantagePoint product, the company\u2019s newer professional services SaaS ERP solution.","In addition to this organic innovation, Deltek onboarded and integrated two acquisitions, ComputerEase and Avitru both targeted to meaningfully enhance their architectural engineering and construction offer. Aderant had a stellar year. This time last year, we talked about product innovation and Aderant, specifically about three newer SaaS products, based on the market traction of these products, especially their e-billing and mid-law SaaS solutions and combined with Aderant's continued ability to take share in the large law space, Aderant posted double-digit organic growth in the year.","Also, in the fourth quarter, we acquired Bellefield Systems for Aderant, which enhances their SaaS solutions targeting the front office of law firms, specifically focused on professional service automation, compliance and timekeeping.","As we turn to PowerPlan, we saw double-digit increases in their recurring revenues in the year. These recurring revenue increases were offset by expected declines in their service revenue, which were largely tied to lease accounting product implementation sold and delivered throughout 2018.","Strata continues to be a star within Roper, having tremendous organic growth gains this year again. To remind everyone, Strata is our SaaS software business that helps hospitals have better visibility to their financial operations, both costing and revenue. Strata solutions better enable hospital executives to plan and run their hospital operation.","Also in the quarter, Strata launched a new product, a new data product called StrataSphere. Today, about 25% of U.S. hospitals operational and financial data runs through Strata\u2019s products. StrataSphere is designed to normalize this data set and provide strata's customers with AI-enhanced insights into the data and content across various customer cohorts.","It is very early days of this product, but the team is very excited to partner with our customers to fully develop the products potential. Within our lab software business, Sunquest, our U.S. focused business continued to face the same competitive headwind throughout the year, which we expect to persist into 2020. However, much of this headwind is mitigated by continued organic gains at Data Innovations and CliniSys.","Finally, before turning to the segment\u2019s 2020 outlook, we wanted to highlight that CBORD had a great year with very strong organic growth and even better cash performance. As for the outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with broad-based growth contributions across the segment. It's worth noting Deltek\u2019s momentum entering this year based on their recent double-digit bookings increases.","Next slide please. For the year, revenue for our Network Software & Systems segment came in at $1.539 billion, which represented an increase of 5% on an organic basis. And EBITDA was $681 million, an increase of 17% versus prior year and EBITDA margins were amazing 44.3%.","During 2019, we successfully completed the acquisitions of Foundry and iPipeline. While still early, both are off to a great start and have very solid growth contributions plan for 2020. Those management teams have welcomed the Roper approach and are excited to be part of our enterprise.","On an organic basis, DAT had a truly amazing year. Their growth has been multifaceted with meaningful contributions coming from expansions to their core freight match network and growth and their rate data offering. MHA had a great year as well. Their growth was a function of continued competitive strength and near 100% customer retention, combined with adding several new contracted pharmaceutical products to their portfolio.","In addition to a very solid financial year, the company executed a precedent succession in a near-perfect manner. ConstructConnect had a good year as well. Much of 2019 was focused on launching their new integrated SaaS solution, which they did quite well. ConstructConnect has seen increased ARPU or revenue per user from new customers as these contractors are seeing more value in the integrated bid management and project estimating solution.","iTrade was fantastic in 2019. Rob and his team did a tremendous job driving very strong renewals, adding several new customers and positioning the product portfolio for continued long-term network expansion.","Finally, TransCore\u2019s year was highlighted by their high profile and large contract win with the New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project. As we turn to the outlook for next year or this year, we see mid-teens organic growth for the segment. Within this outlook, we see mid-single-digit plus organic growth for our network software businesses and very strong organic growth for TransCore on the back of the New York City congestion pricing project.","For the first quarter of this year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment. Excluding TransCore, we expect low single-digit growth for the first quarter, given a very challenging Q1 comp for MHA. Specific to TransCore, now that the New York City project details are coming more into view, we expect the majority of TransCore\u2019s growth to occur in Q2 through Q4, though the timing of project revenues will be difficult to forecast with precision, given that we are in the early stages of this large New York City project.","Next slide please. For the year, revenue for our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment came in at $1.596 billion, which represented an increase of 2% on an organic basis and EBITDA was $541 million a decrease of 4% versus the prior year, but EBITDA grew 2%, excluding divestitures. EBITDA margins were 33.9%.","For the year, we saw strong execution across our medical product businesses. In total, this grew high single digits organically for the year. Within the medical products businesses, NDI was the star for 2019. This business grew double-digit on the back of very strong adoption of both their electromagnetic and optical precision measurement and guidance solution.","Verathon growth in 2019 was driven by meaningful and successful product launch of a single-use bronchoscope and new product extensions across the full GlideScope product family. Both of which we introduced on this call a year ago. In addition, 2019 is the year that is marked by Verathon\u2019s reoccurring consumables revenues becoming larger than their capital-based product revenues.","For these reasons, this business is very well positioned for continued strong growth in 2020 and for many years after. Finally, in the medical products group, CIVCO grew nicely again, based on market adoption of their ultrasound guidance and infection control products.","Neptune for the year grew mid-single-digits. Importantly, Neptune saw nice increases in our residential static ultrasonic water meter products. In addition, Neptune made very nice gains in our innovation lab relative to the larger gauge commercial and industrial static meters. We continued to feel very good about how Neptune is positioned to compete and win in the marketplace.","Turning to our shorter cycle and industrial businesses, these businesses performed very well in 2019 amid challenging end market conditions. As we all know, the market conditions change meaningfully in the second quarter of the year. While the businesses did decline a bit in the year, their early recognition of the changing market conditions and their corresponding expense management was well executed.","Of note and of importance, we did see some moderation of their declines in the most recent quarter. Also during the year, we successfully exited our scientific imaging and Gatan businesses and generated $1.2 billion of pretax proceeds.","As we turn to 2020, we see this segment growing mid-single-digit organically based on continued strength in our medical products and Neptune franchises. We further expect to see continued industrial declines in the first half and return to modest growth in the second half, largely based on easing 2H comps.","Next slide, please. For the year, revenue for our Process Technologies segment came in at $653 million, which was a 4% organic decline for the year. EBITDA was $238 million, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year, and EBITDA margins was 36.4%.","Our upstream oil and gas businesses declined high single digits in the year due to the deteriorating market conditions that we discussed throughout the year. However, our CCC business continues to perform well based on the competitive strength in winning virtually all of the new LNG construction projects. In addition, CCC's strategy of increasing their intimacy with their core customers is yielding nice system replacement opportunities.","Cornell executed at a very high level throughout the year. They saw a very strong growth across virtually all of their end markets, with particular strength in their ag market offering. In addition, Cornell saw strength across their aftermarket parts business for much of the year. These strengths were offset by declines in their rental markets. All in all, another solid year for Cornell.","Finally, we saw EBITDA margins expand across this segment. These businesses increased margins in the face of very uncertain and declining market conditions. This is possible given the very high variable cost nature of the businesses, which provide our business leaders the ability to take cost out extremely fast once weakening market conditions are observed. There is no better example of nimble execution than this.","Also, and to this end, we discussed how PAC and CCC had new President onboarded in 2019. Each of these new teams performed exactly as we would have hoped: swiftly, nimbly and with conviction. As we look to 2020, we see this segment declining mid-single digits based on the continued assumptions of upstream oil and gas market difficulties. However, comps do ease in the second half.","Next slide, please. Now turning to our 2020 full year guidance. We are establishing our 2020 full year adjusted DEPS guidance in the range of $13.30 to $13.60, with organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%. This organic revenue growth range includes the impact of TransCore's growth associated with their New York City congestion pricing project. Excluding TransCore, organic growth for the enterprise is expected to be in the 3% to 4% range.","For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22%. For Q1, we expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $2.94 and $3 per share. To remind everyone, last year's Q1 had a $0.41 tax benefit. Further, and as discussed earlier, we expect the majority of TransCore's growth to occur in Q2 through Q4.","Next slide please. As we look back on 2019, we're very pleased with our results and our strategic process. We continue to see strength in our niche market strategy and governance model that promotes nimble local execution. EBITDA for the year increased 7% to $1.93 billion, and EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to 35.8%. Adjusted DEPS increased 10% to $13.05 per share. Free cash flow increased to $1.44 billion and was an astounding 27% of revenue.","Specific to our portfolio of businesses, we meaningfully improved our business mix. We deployed $2.4 billion toward software acquisitions led by Foundry and iPipeline. We also exited our imaging and Gatan businesses.","Finally, I'm very pleased with the improvements we made across the enterprise relative to talent. I feel fantastic about the team in Sarasota. In addition to the existing team, during the year, we onboarded two group executives, Satish and Harold. This team is executing at a very high level, and I'm excited for the future.","Also, there are meaningful improvements across our business units in terms of the talent offense they are deploying. We're playing the long game, and I fully expect our talent focus to pay dividends in the years to come.","As we turn to 2020, we are super well positioned. First, we expect to deliver fantastic organic growth for the year that will be broad-based across our software platforms, Neptune, medical products, RF products and TransCore. The growth in these parts of our businesses will meaningfully outpace market weakness across our short-cycle industrial and our oil and gas-related businesses.","Relative to future capital deployment, we are very offensively positioned to execute our M&A strategy. The sale of Gatan, our attractive August bond issue, $0 drawn on our $2.5 billion revolver and a building cash balance, has our balance sheet wonderfully well positioned. We continue to be very active evaluating new capital deployment ideas, and our pipeline is quite full with high-quality opportunities. We will continue to be very disciplined and hold true to our CRI-based principles, and we are optimistic for a successful year of capital deployment.","Now as we turn to your questions, I want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in niche markets that have the proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as their businesses expand. We provide our business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like while driving long-term CRI-accretive growth with particular emphasis focused on strategy, operation, innovation and talent development.","Our business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for talent and to compete and win for customers that, in turn, allow us to compete for and win shareholders.","To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And based on these factors and perhaps most importantly, we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual trust and transparency. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company that, in turn, help accelerate our cash flow compounding. It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results.","We appreciate your time this morning. Now let's turn the call over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Neil Hunn","Hey, good morning.","Deane Dray","Because the New York City congestion tolling project is such a high-profile installation for you all, I'd be interested in hearing some more color on how this installation compares to the others that you've done in, let's say, London and Stockholm. Just from a sense of degree of difficulty of the installation, is there any, like, new software? New camera systems? Or is this basically similar to what you've done in these other successful installations?","Neil Hunn","Sure, Deane. So let me first start by saying the congestion pricing infrastructure in those other two cities is not us. So those are not our projects. That said, the technology that's being used in the New York City project is, for the most part, the exact same technology that's been used in any of our larger tolling infrastructure projects. It's the same core hardware. It's the same core software.","Certainly, there'll be some tweaks that are needed in the software for the specific application that's being used by MTA in this instance. But the scale of this project is not actually close to the largest that we've deployed. So the team feels quite confident in the technical ability to do it.","Further, our customer, MTA has been \u2013 is a great partner. And all the sort of the process steps to be able to construct in New York City have largely already been approved. And so it really is just down to executing the project over the course of this year.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just some more color on the expected \u2013 the margin progression for 2020 for the project. It looks like it's starting more into the second quarter. But typically, do you see lower margin early in the project, on the installation, more upfront costs, and just \u2013 and then higher margin in the back quarters? Just what's the expectation here, the base case?","Rob Crisci","Yes. Deane, I think that's right. I think you're just getting started with the project here in the first quarter. So we think you'd assume you'd have a little bit less \u2013 well, we know we have a little bit less revenue recognition, probably a little bit lower margin, and as we move on throughout the year, both of those will increase quite a bit.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just last one for me on Deltek. Could you just provide some color or context around the pushouts on the perpetual deals. You said it got pushed into 2020. Is this a first quarter or second quarter? And just what are the \u2013 some color around the customer decisions there?","Neil Hunn","Sure. So a couple of things on Deltek. We talked about how their bookings, on an ACV basis, we're quite strong all year, with strength ending the year in the high teens in Q4. So the competing and winning in the marketplace has remained robust throughout the year. Specific to the revenue recognition, it's really a combination of two things here in Q4, being \u2013 one is, the company has announced its intention to release an ITAR-compliant version of their cost point product, which is the GovCon ERP product, which really essentially enables that product to be hosted in the cloud and deploy it in the SaaS environment.","So there are a couple of deals signed in Q4 taking advantage of that offering. And so that's a great trend for the business because the recurring revenue will increase quite meaningfully as that becomes more \u2013 gains more traction. That, combined with the fact that a couple \u2013 a handful of meaningfully sized perpetual deals pushed. And so if in the hypothetical world, if the ITAR-compliant SaaS product was not there, likely, these customers would have bought perpetual version. And then Deltek's would have been right in line. So it's really a combination of the SaaS offering gaining traction and a couple of deals pushing into the first or second quarter next year.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Neil Hunn","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you, good morning. As you're positioning for substantial allocation as you referenced a few times for this year. Just curious, look back at a few of the larger ones, iPipeline, Foundry, PowerPlan, around management retention, other key metrics on onboarding and anything in particular around those recent deals that's evolving. How you evaluate trade-offs with new opportunities as you're kind of shopping criteria evolves over time.","Neil Hunn","So the criteria for capital deployment really has not changed that much. It's always been rooted in finding businesses that have better cash returns than our existing. Over the arc of 20 years, that's gone from industrial products to medical products, the more software. The second criteria is always having a management team that is fundamentally focused on building the business versus transacting. And then finally, businesses that share the characteristics that all 45 of our businesses do, right, niche, leadership position, ability to invest in themselves to grow, high recurring revenues, high gross margins, et cetera.","So those criteria have not changed at all and it won't change going forward. The recent acquisitions that you referenced, certainly the ones really from Deltek, ConstructConnect, Aderant, PowerPlan, Foundry, iPipeline, the larger ones from 2016 forward, have met all those criteria, and the businesses are performing at or maybe modestly above our initial expectations.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then just curious, in the pipeline, the more actionable end of it as you see it, what's kind of the mix between bolt-ons versus platform opportunities?","Neil Hunn","Yes. The vast majority of our deployment will be on platform ideas. Occasionally, we'll do bolt-ons or tuck-ins as they strategically warrant in the business. It's not a budget. If you just look over our arc of time, about 10% of the capital deployed, it's been in bolt-ons, but it's just been a by-product of how it's unfolded. It's certainly not a budget or a planning number going forward. But my bid will be somewhere in that plus or minus ballpark.","Christopher Glynn","Got you. Thank you.","Neil Hunn","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. The first question I have is free cash flow as a percentage of sales for Process Technologies. Do you happen to have that metric or that percentage?","Neil Hunn","We don't. The free cash flow number is a corporate number with all the corporate interest tax, et cetera. So we don't look at it in that way. I would say the business level cash flow. So if you look at sort of EBITDA to revenue, subtracting their CapEx is pretty darn close to their EBITDA because the CapEx is not a big number. And then from a working capital perspective, there's not huge movement there. So it's still a very high number. I can't give you an exact free cash flow number for the\u2026","Robert McCarthy","Okay. But it screens very well in free cash flow by definition then?","Neil Hunn","Absolutely.","Rob Crisci","Absolutely.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. Fair point. And then if you look at your outlook, excluding the drag from process, what do you think you would have grown this year organically?","Rob Crisci","So process for the year was minus 4%. So you're talking 12% of the company. So we would add a \u2013 probably a point or 2, just doing the math at the top of my head\u2026","Robert McCarthy","And then in 2020, probably something similar or even higher? Right?","Rob Crisci","That's right.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then moving on to TransCore. From that perspective, could you just remind us to level set our expectations in the out-years? How you're thinking about the initial deployment revenue and then conceptually the step-down from there, just so we get our modeling directionally correct in the out-years.","Neil Hunn","Yes. So there's the 200 or so incremental revenue this year. And then there will be some recurring from the project, probably in the $50 million to $60 million range into next year and then into the next several years. So that would then leave the rest of TransCore, and a lot of other projects we're working on, to pick up some of that slack, which they're working hard on already today.","Robert McCarthy","Right. And then last question is really around M&A. Obviously, I think Danaher announced today decent results after a preannouncement, and then I think rebaseline for more \u2013 even more favorable financing environment for underwriting one of the deals. So clearly, a pretty attractive environment, which you alluded to on the call in terms of the capital markets and debt for funding these deals.","And you talked about the mission bolt-ons. I mean, you look at Neptune, good growth, a great franchise. There is a sense that the smart metering, while albeit at a low rate of growth, maybe in the low single digits, could be very sustainable for a long period of time.","And there is some sense that transmission and distribution spending could be entering a higher level of visible spending just given PG&E and some of the return profile of AMI. Is it possible for you guys to think about building around that more than software? Is the utility end market an attractive space? Or how would you think about that?","Neil Hunn","Yes. So Neptune, as you know, is 100% focused in the water meter business, and that's where they're going to be. They're not going to stray to gas or electric meters. And more importantly, it's really water meters in North America, where pressure rates are higher than the rest of the world. So it's a pretty complicated device metering application, both mechanical and ultrasonic.","So the company is going to stay focused there. That said, the company now for at least three years has been investing in its software applications and capability because now the readers are being read more frequently. And so there's more use cases that are being developed about what you do with that data around leak detection or shutoff or whatever our customers ask for, Neptune is working to build.","The shutoff is a hard case, but leak detection is a good case, for instance, in terms of value to the end user. So they \u2013 to that end, they opened an innovation center three years or so ago in Atlanta to attract better talent than they could in their existing locations in more rural Alabama. So it's been a part of the strategy, and I suspect it will remain part of the strategy for quite some time.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for the questions.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Neil Hunn","Hey, good morning.","Steve Tusa","You mentioned PowerPlan saw some solid growth in a part of its business. What did ultimately PowerPlan grow for the year in total?","Rob Crisci","Yes, PowerPlan for the year was down a little bit. We think it will be up in 2020 full year, including the first quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then ConstructConnect as well, did that grow this year?","Rob Crisci","It did.","Neil Hunn","Yes, it grew in 2019.","Steve Tusa","Is that like low singles or something like that or?","Rob Crisci","Correct.","Neil Hunn","Yes, low single.","Steve Tusa","And then lastly, just for the \u2013 just for modeling purposes, I know you have the Gatan sale headwind on revenue next year. What are the \u2013 what's the carryover acquisition-related tailwind that we should add to kind of that organic growth outlook? So on a reported basis?","Rob Crisci","Yes. So I've got \u2013 so from an EBITDA standpoint, there's about $70 million of EBITDA from the acquisitions. That's an add and then you take away about $50 million of EBITDA from Gatan. So it's a net around $20 million of EBITDA.","Steve Tusa","And then on sales?","Rob Crisci","Yes. On sales, it's going to be \u2013 I don't have the exact number. I'll have to follow-up with you on that, but it's going to be roughly \u2013 you have it, Shannon?","Shannon O'Callaghan","Yes. It nested on 0.","Rob Crisci","Yes. It nested 0 on revenue.","Steve Tusa","0 on \u2013 0 carryover with \u2013 including Gatan?","Rob Crisci","Yes. Yes. Because the Gatan is a lower margin.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then, sorry, one last one. Just on first quarter organic, you mentioned that there is some TransCore impact, because you talked about first quarter growth in that segment, ex-TransCore. I guess, ex-TransCore in the first quarter, is it 2 to 3, 1 to 2? Or is it not even that, like, meaningful on an enterprise basis?","Rob Crisci","It's not too meaningful. There's some incremental revenue from TransCore there in the first quarter. But it's not a big add to the first quarter. And as I think you know, Q1 last year was 6% organic. So they're really \u2013 it's just a matter of the comps. If you look at the software businesses, for example, it's just the comps that the \u2013 is the only difference as we move forward throughout the year.","Steve Tusa","Got it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Rob Crisci","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just could you possibly just give some commentary around the profit associated with the MTA contract? And then what's \u2013 what might be the cadence there? I mean, is that a \u2013 just an EBIT or EBITDA contribution from that contract? And is it \u2013 does it scale up meaningfully as the revenue grows there? Or is \u2013 just some feel for what that could add, so I can get kind of a sense per share on a quarterly basis, given our revenue assumptions.","Rob Crisci","Yes. So I think as you're aware, the TransCore business margin is below the Roper average. And so this business is going to be in that range. And I think the margins do improve after the first quarter moving forward. Exactly how linear that's going to be, is difficult to predict, as Neil mentioned, given what goes on with the project, but it certainly will get a little bit better after the first quarter, and it's probably going to be relatively consistent throughout the rest of the year as our \u2013 is our best estimate as we sit here today.","Richard Eastman","So okay. So it comes in at TransCore's average contribution?","Neil Hunn","Correct.","Rob Crisci","That's correct.","Richard Eastman","Okay.","Neil Hunn","That's correct. And it'll be a little more profitable in the back three quarters in the first quarter, but it's not something where it's breakeven Q1, 10% Q2 and 40% in Q4. It's not anything like that at all.","Richard Eastman","And you referenced this just a couple of minutes ago. I think somebody asked a similar question around \u2013 so $200 million is still the right expectation around year one this year, and then I think on a previous call, it was maybe $50 million to finish off the project in year two. But then the other $250 million of the contract essentially was years three to seven on a service contract. Is that still kind of roughly the schedule?","Rob Crisci","Yes. That's correct. Yes, so there's like, what we've said $50 million recurring after 2020 goes on for five years, and we would hope it would go on many years after that as you get a chance to renew the maintenance part.","Richard Eastman","Right. Okay. And then just a second follow-up question around Roper's core EBITDA. Fantastic year from the margin perspective for the full 2019. The puts and takes here, maybe a little bit around MTA contract as well as your commentary around a minus mid-single-digit growth for the Process Tech piece of the business in 2020. What might be a reasonable assumption in basis points for targeted EBITDA margin expansion for Roper in 2020? Would a reasonable target be 50 or?","Rob Crisci","Yes so \u2013 Yes. No. I think embedded in our initial guidance as it normally is, is that EBITDA margins will be roughly flat year-over-year. There's maybe a little bit of an increase. But certainly, the TransCore project is a negative. And then some declines in those more cyclical businesses is generally a negative to your margin. And the flip side of that is excellent growth at the software businesses, which is a net positive. And if you add all those things together, our initial signs model has the EBITDA margins about flat year-over-year, and we'll work to do a little bit better than that.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then, if you mind, could I just sneak one more in, please. Just the transportation business within network software, that \u2013 the freight matching business is just another tremendous year in a tough \u2013 fairly tough trucking industry, I guess, if you will. Is that a countercyclical business as things get tough in the trucking industry, we're looking to optimize our assets there by matching freight? And just maybe explain that business a little bit and then maybe what the prospects are for 2020.","Neil Hunn","Sure. I'll take that one, Rick. So first, DAT, let's define what they are. It's full truckload, spot market North America freight match, right. So it is a niche industry. There's captive, there's contracted and there's spot markets. But what we have observed here over the last really two or three years with DAT is their network strength, right, it's a \u2013 their relative market share is three-ish versus their competitor, right. So their network is three times the size their next largest competitor. That network strength has proven to play well when the trucking markets are super hot and when they weak.","So step back from that, why is that, right. So if you're a carrier, and it is a very hot market. The carrier is going to want to be very selective in their routes. Maybe they're going from Kansas City, Chicago, and they want to go right back to Kansas City. So they're going to be a network participant to be able to select specifically what they want. So you see active participation.","And then conversely, the brokers are looking for the capacity. When things lighten up, the truckers are looking for work, right. So they become less selective. And so the value proposition of participating in the network on both sides of the network in both market conditions tend to be quite robust.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And outlook for 2020? I mean, do we kind of sustain the current growth rate? Or do we settle down? It's just there's \u2013 it seems around the fringes, there's more competition in that space, but you guys have maneuvered quite well there.","Neil Hunn","Yes. There is \u2013 there really isn't more competition in the freight matching space. That said, this company has done so well for a number of years. We do expect the growth to moderate a bit in 2020.","Rob Crisci","Just based on the activity in the market is the only thing driving that.","Neil Hunn","That said, we expected this business to moderate for the last few years as well and they've outlasted our expectations.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Neil Hunn","Yes.","Operator","And your next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks a lot. Maybe just trying to keep my questions a little briefer. Maybe starting with the Software-as-a-Service model. You've spent some time in the prepared remarks discussing that. Just wondered with that strength in Q4, what's the overall scale of your SaaS business now within Roper? And relating to the profitability on that, I think in Q2, you'd had a SaaS kind of mix surge and that had hurt margins in Application Software. Q4, it seems like SaaS did very well again, and may be contributing positively to the margin mix. So maybe help us understand the margin dynamics as that SaaS share of sales expands.","Rob Crisci","Yes. So we're still about even in between the SaaS revenue and the traditional on-prem license maintenance revenue within our software businesses. And from a margin perspective, there really isn't that large of a difference in terms of EBITDA margin between those two business models for our businesses. It's \u2013 where the variability happens, as Neil mentioned, is when you get a new license win in a quarter, all that revenue is recognized immediately. If you get a new SaaS win in a quarter, that revenue is recognized over the next 12 months and beyond. So that's the only difference. But from a margin standpoint, there isn't a lot of change within the two models.","Neil Hunn","Yes, I think the 2Q point you're referencing is Deltek had two very large perpetual deals in 2Q of 2018, which drove outsized margin and that's very specific. So it's a very hard comp coming over in 2Q of 2019, if my memory serves correct.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then maybe for Neil. You mentioned talent development in your prepared remarks. Maybe expand a little bit what you're hoping to see from those group executive roles this year? And also, I think, a bit more of a push on organic growth is underway at Roper. In that context, maybe just if you could highlight what the R&D spending was in 2019? I know we'll see it in the K, but maybe how you see the cadence of R&D developing?","Neil Hunn","Sure. All right. If these are short questions, Julian, and I'd hate to hear a long one. So I'll try to hit the talent, the group, the organic and the R&D. So I'll hit the organic first. So we said that it's my intention objective to position the company, reporting of my businesses to execute our organic growth strategy that's been a little bit better in the past. That said, this is going to take time because we want to do it structurally. We want to do it \u2013 we're playing the long game.","And importantly, we're going to only do it to the extent that CRI accretive. And so this is going to take a long time. And success, by the way, is measured by 50 or 100 basis points more of organic growth, not doubling the organic growth profile because these businesses are built for defensibility, yet we haven't met a Roper business that's optimized its organic growth algorithm. And so we believe there's long-term, I'll emphasize long-term, potential there.","Now we're going to do that through the group executives, engaging with our teams, principally on three things: how to develop strategy, how to execute strategy and how to run a talent offense. And so we can spend more time later sort of unpacking that because it's a passion of ours here to do that. But we believe sort of the right strategy with the right strategic enablement, with putting the right field \u2013 the right team on the field, will yield great results for our shareholders over a long arc of time.","Specific to your R&D spend. In 2020, for the software businesses, but basically both software segments. We're planning on 70 or 80 basis points more spend in R&D. So when you multiply that through, it's $20 million or $25 million of incremental spend in R&D relative to the revenue and that sort of spread across where the best opportunities are in each one of the businesses. And that \u2013 we'd expect that pace to \u2013 I can't tell you if it's that exact number of basis points each year, but expect that number to continue to increase over time as it naturally does in software businesses. And that is embedded in everything Rob mentioned earlier about margins being flat for the year and margins that \u2013 everything he talked about. So that's my view on your question and happy to follow-up as needed later.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So Neil, you mentioned the headwinds in Sunquest continuing into 2020. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on whether \u2013 what kind of impact it's going to have 2020? And specifically, whether \u2013 what you're doing to mitigate some of that within Sunquest?","Neil Hunn","Yes. So the headwind is the same headwind the business has experienced for quite some time. It's \u2013 it is, unfortunately, like slow motion and tectonically playing out because our customers, when they make a decision to leave three years ago. It takes them three years to leave. And so there's no new information. It's just taking this time to play out. The mitigating fact is we've decided, is we continue to invest in the products of this business, right. So we've invested in internationalization of the product. We are investing in the molecular genetic capabilities. We're investing in the integration of the fluid tissue and genetic molecular labs, and that continues and will continue. And so it's \u2013 we just have to let this one competitive headwind play itself out of the course of the next year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Got it. And then just a real quick one. On ComputerEase and iPipeline, the growth expected for 2020, is it supposed to be similar to the organic growth for the rest of the segment?","Neil Hunn","Well, yes, I think when we announced iPipeline, we felt really good about that being a high single-digit organic grower and nothing has changed to our opinion on that.","Joe Ritchie","And ComputerEase?","Rob Crisci","Yes, that's a smaller add-on to Deltek. And it's probably mid single-digit organic grower or maybe better.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thanks guys.","Neil Hunn","Thanks.","Operator","Next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thanks and good morning. I promise, I will be brief. Just on TransCore, back to that. I just want to understand how the cash flow actually works on the project. Would you expect to receive ratable cash flow because you're doing the work? Or would this be a very back-end loaded? And maybe even kind of a 2021 kind of cash event for the business?","Neil Hunn","That sounds like the same questions we asked our management team during this project run out. So we do feel that \u2013 we do feel the cash flows to be pretty well aligned with our earnings on the project. We've worked hard with that. We have a great partner that's working with us to make sure that, that happens. And so we do feel good about the cash coming in sort of in line with the EBITDA. Now certainly, you could see some payments in 2021 after the project is ended. So we'll see what happens but we're working hard to make sure the cash comes in on time.","Jeff Sprague","And just on Neptune, is there anything programmatic going on in 2020? Big localities or anything that's driving the business? Or it's just kind of more steady as she goes kind of penetration push?","Neil Hunn","Steady as she goes. Neptune's strategy has been actually focused on the medium and smaller municipalities. That's what their strength has been and will continue to be.","Jeff Sprague","Great, thank you.","Neil Hunn","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Yes, good morning.","Neil Hunn","Good morning, Joe.","Rob Crisci","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Giordano","So just on TransCore, what's the risk that, that deal leads into 2021 that the deployment actually takes longer or it gets started late?","Rob Crisci","It's already started.","Neil Hunn","It's already started. Yes. So the \u2013 it's a big project. It's got some complexity associated with it. So it certainly has a possibility of some of that bleeds into 2021. That said, let me be very clear, our customer has told us the infrastructure needs to be ready by December 31, 2020. And that's the project plan. That's the resources that are being deployed because that will then, in turn, enable the MTA to decide when and how they want to introduce the tolling. So our part of the project is to be completed by the end of the year per our customers' demand.","Joe Giordano","Okay, fair enough. And then how should we think about \u2013 absent forward M&A that I'm sure you'll do, but if we just strip that out, how do we think about the forward margin opportunity in the application network? Like how much of a drag on margins are the current new \u2013 relatively new business in there? And just how should we think about the floor opportunity to expand from already pretty high levels? ","Rob Crisci","Yes. So I wouldn't view the new businesses as a drag at all. I mean, they're all generally in line with the margins \u2013 EBITDA margins, right. Yes. I'm always speaking in terms of EBITDA margins and Shannon is correcting me \u2013 sometimes correcting me that the analyst think in terms of OP a lot of times. But from an EBITDA margin perspective, very consistent and there's no reason why they should go backwards.","As Neil mentioned, I mean, we're always spending a lot in R&D. We're growing R&D, and you \u2013 and it's easy to do that when you have businesses that come in at a high contribution margins. There's plenty of dollars to invest in R&D and talent and people and everything, and that's really how these businesses grow. So we're continuing to do that. So I wouldn't see any sort of a margin headwind for these businesses any time into the future.","Joe Giordano","How should we think about them expanding? Like just normal kind of just capturing an incremental on the growth? Is there like\u2026","Rob Crisci","Yes. It's incremental on the growth, right. I mean, when you have EBITDA margins in that 40% range, that's a very healthy software business that continually invests to grow. So I think that if it expands, great, but it's really about growing more at current margins.","Joe Giordano","Yes, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Rob Crisci","Yes.","Operator","And your next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","My questions have been answered. Thank you.","Neil Hunn","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your next question will come from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys. Sorry, just a quick follow-up. Anything moving around on like cash conversion? I know that with the TransCore deal coming through, maybe it's a bit of a different cash profile early on. Anything \u2013 any dynamics there we have to be aware of for cash conversion or cash margin in 2020?","Rob Crisci","Yes. No. Thanks, Steve, for the question. I was preparing for it. I'm glad you got back on and asked. Yes. No, we definitely feel free cash flow\u2026.","Steve Tusa","Somebody pinged me to add \u2013 just want me to ask about this \u2013 usually a follow up but here we go.","Rob Crisci","You saved the day. Yes. No, I think if you look at our overall guide, free cash flow should grow double digits based on our guide in 2020. And then, obviously, as we do acquisitions, that should be further accretive to that. So that's sort of how we see it as of today. So no, there's no headwinds on cash flow.","Steve Tusa","I guess, your free cash flow this year grew a little bit less than that. What is the \u2013 is there anything unique kind of year-to-year that drives an acceleration of that?","Rob Crisci","Yes. So what balances around, right, so if you're looking at conversion to adjusted net earnings, what balances around the most is tax payments and cash tax versus GAAP tax. And so that's been a headwind the last couple of years with a lot more cash tax payments. And also, as I mentioned in the pre \u2013 in the scripted comments around TransCore, it didn't have a very good cash year around some projects last year, and then some of the product businesses weren't great. So I think as we sit \u2013 from a working capital standpoint, I think that we've got some additional room to improve. And so then that will be beneficial to cash flow next year and beyond. Everything else is very structural from a high cash conversion standpoint.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Neil Hunn","Thank you.","Rob Crisci","Thank you.","Operator","And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to management for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.","Operator","That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"18892":["Roper Industries Inc.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being record. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","John Humphrey","Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our first quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com.","Next slide. So we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a GAAP basis. Prior period results are presented on an adjusted basis for comparison purposes. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation, which is available on our website.","Now if you'll please turn to slide, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. So we'll go through the first quarter enterprise financial results first and then we'll take a look at the detail around each of our four segments and the outlook for those four segments for the second quarter and the full year as a total, and then what our Q2 guidance is. As you know, we're raising our guidance here for the full year. And then have a Q&A session.","So next slide. Here we'll look at the summary of the enterprise financial results. We had once again all-time records for orders and backlog. And revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, everything at an all-time record level, really terrific quarter. Revenue was up 13% with organic revenue up 7% and the book-to-bill was above 1 at 1.01. If you look at GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, they actually came at about the same at 13% revenue up. Gross margin was up 120 basis points to 58.6%. I hope you're shocked to see our gross margin. And there's some reversion to a mean of those industrial companies that people look at. But we're not really an industrial company anymore and our 58.6% gross margin is in fact up 120 basis points. If you looked at GAAP to GAAP, it would have been up 140 basis points.","Our EBITDA was up 19% to $274 million and our EBITDA margin was up 180 basis points to 32.8%. If you looked at GAAP to GAAP, it would have been up 21%. Our earnings before tax, which is a really important number this time around, are up 24% to $205 million. You may remember that a lot of people, ourselves included, in the first quarter of 2013 benefited from the expenders in the tax program and double-dip benefit on R&D tax credits and they'll benefit yet this year. And we had a discrete item this quarter that benefited us by $0.06 despite the headwind that we had.","Our operating cash flow was also up 24%. So the operating cash flow and the earnings before tax were virtually identical. Free cash flow was up 26% to $202 million. So it's a great start for the year.","Next slide. Here if we look at the income statement, you can see orders came in at $846 million, giving us a book-to-bill of 1.01 against the revenue of $834 million. I will talk about growth here in just a minute. The gross margin, as we said, was up 120 basis points. Operating income increased by 18.3%. On a GAAP to GAAP basis, it was over 20%. Operating margin was at 26.8%, up 130 basis points. And the earnings before tax number was up 24%.","As we said, the tax rate, you can see the difference here. Last year was 23.1%. This year, it's 28.2%. So that's 510 basis point headwind into the quarter compared to last year, but that was an unrealistic expectation. And in fact, our 28.2% was a little bit better on the tax side than our guidance had anticipated. If you do look at 28.2% in common size over the first quarter of last year, our earnings would have been $1.18, not $1.27. And we compare that with $1.46, we're up 23%.","Next slide. On the EBITDA growth and margin expansion, our long-term sustainable trends continued. You see our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now at $1.118 billion. That's up 35% in the last two years from $830 million. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA margin is now at 33.2%, up 320 basis points from just two years ago. And if you really want to see the power of our Roper business model and how the CRI tools work, all you have to do is go back to 2010 with our year-end EBITDA was at 26.7% compared to our closing year-end EBITDA this past year in 2013 of 32.8%. And you see 610 basis points of improvement. And compare that to the S&P 500 on gross margins, which are around 28% in those periods.","Next slide. If you look at our cash flow results, you see once again terrific results accelerating activity. We had $213 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, which was over 25% of sales. Cash conversion was 144%. And on a free cash flow basis, we generated $202 million of free cash flow and conversion was 137%. We earned $1.46 on a diluted basis, but if you look at that conversion of 137%, you can do the math and see what the free cash flow per share was. That's really a direct result of how great each of these individual businesses that we have really are and their ability to deploy our CRI tools and discipline to create these sustainable cash flows. As a percent of revenue, you can see free cash flow for the last 12 months has now been 24% of revenue.","We said in this year's annual report and repeated here in the takeaway that we believe cash is the best measure of performance. And I guess we're maybe as timely just put that on everyone of our slides that we believe cash is the measure of performance.","Next slide. Asset-light business model, well, just to demonstrate, even when you get these very low levels, there's room for improvement. If you look at the first quarter in 2012, our inventory was running 7.5% of sales. And here we are two years later at 6.3% of sales. Receivables have gone from 16.9% to 18.2%. That's actually favorable, because unbilled receivables are in that number. And that's why we look at the deferred revenue aspect of things. Payables and accruals are at 18.2%. So they're up nicely, giving us the inventory plus receivables minus payables on accruals line there at 6.3% of revenue, down 320 basis points from just two years ago. So for those people who think we can't continue to improve, we just want to demonstrate that the processes we have do create really unusual values.","Next slide. Strong financial position, I think our press release indicates it's best in our history from a balance sheet viewpoint. Last May, we acquired MHA for $1 billion. So we've been able to self-fund virtually that entire $1 billion acquisition during the course of the year. You can see our cash is now up to $503 million and an undrawn revolver of $1.4 billion. So we have $1.9 billion of immediate liquidity here. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is up from $950 million $1.118 billion. So the gross debt number EBITDA is about 2.1 versus 2.0 a year ago. After investing $1.07 billion last year, we would say that we would expect to do the same thing during the next 12 months, probably even a greater amount of investment here in capital deployment.","Next slide. We'll move here into the segment detail and look at each of the individual businesses. So next slide, we'll start with an overview of how widespread the growth was here in the quarter. On the left-hand side of this chart, you can see the organic growth by segment. Energy was up 5% and Medical & Imaging up 7%, RF up 8%, Industrial Technology up 9%. Industrial Technology is primarily Neptune, including handling. About a quarter of Industrial Technology is actually industrial businesses that are instrumentation businesses. All the rest are really water, including handling.","In the RF segment, which was up 8%, that's really the toll business, our SaaS software businesses, are CBORD and Horizon legacy software businesses and then just a modest amount of products. Medical & Imaging is really split between the medical IT business, which is the largest amount, the medical products business and some scientific instrumentation, a little bit of cameras. And in Energy, that 5% growth comes from about two-thirds of segment is energy related and one-third of that segment is really industrial related.","If you look on the right-hand side and you see the revenue by region, we actually had favorable organic revenue in every region in the world. The US, which is about 61% of revenue, in Canada which is about 6% of revenue came in at up 7%. And then Europe, which includes Russia by the way, which is up 6% with Russia being a modest portion of the $125 million in revenue in Europe. Asia was up 9% with Japan and China being those two biggest areas. And the rest of the world was up 7%. We report the Middle East and Africa in the rest of the world, which is a big portion of that total revenue.","Next slide. By the way, currency, I should just mention currency currently is like 20 basis points. It was pretty much all in Canada, where it depressed our organic revenue. But as an enterprise, it was only at 20 bps negative. So pretty much a neutral.","Next slide, we'll look first here at the Energy Systems & Controls segment. That generated $37 million in operating profit on $155 million of revenue, which is almost 24% OP margin. The organic growth was up 5% that was led by our compressor controls continued to grow in Asia and in the Middle East. We had very solid sales of new instruments for our refinery operations, which sometimes can be pretty cyclical. The Zetec performance improved, so it wasn't as big a drag on the business and we'll talk about that in a minute getting much better throughout the year.","And then our Advanced Sensors acquisition, which came in right at the end of last year, which was $50 million investment in offshore technology, is very interesting technology. The integration process is underway there and it will take through the second half before we turn that business into a more profitable entity. So it was a bit of a drag on margins in the first quarter.","In the second quarter and throughout the year, we expect the oil and gas portions of our Energy segment to be up high single-digits, 8%, 9%, led mostly by the liquid natural gas pipeline activity and the field services associated with the things we do there.","The Zetec outlook is much more encouraging. It'll support second half organic growth. It was a drag last year in the second half. And the segment in total will be on target for record performance in 2014. And just as a reminder, that segment, which is about 15% of the operating profit of the company, it's divided sort of two-thirds to energy and one-third to industrial.","Next slide is our Industrial Technology segment. Here we reported $56 million of operating profit on $197 million in revenue. Industrial Technology is about 23% of the operating profit of the enterprise. We had double-digit growth in Neptune and continued margin expansion at Neptune. There's comments from certain competitors that are inconsistent with that, but we're right, they're wrong.","Higher material analysis revenues at Struers for both equipment and consumables, the equipment is a big deal, because Struers has been living on consumable growth for a while and equipment revenues have been sharply around the world. So that really bodes well for the rest of the year at Struers. And our Roper Pumps' Houston facility was opened. In fact, all of our senior leaders toured that facility in the first quarter. It's a very impressing operation. A lot of customers have been through now, saying it's the best-in-class operation of its site anywhere in the world. And we expect that to start to manifest itself in double-digit growth here in the rest of the year, which will improve our margins. That startup costs are what brought down the margin in the first quarter by a modest amount, but that will easily be past us.","In Cornell, which continues to perform remarkably well, had a big quarter with rental markets, all of which we think probably bodes well for the energy side of the activity we have in industrial.","We look at the second half of the year. We're seeing Roper Pumps' capacity increase will drive share gains against particular competitors. It will lead to double-digit growth for us at Roper Pumps and it'll improve our margins in that business, which were already quite sizeable.","Neptune strength we expect to continue. So we get reasonable numbers on new housing starts and continued build-outs and replacement of old meters and continued deployment in Canada and other systems that we've won. We see modest global industrial production continuing to be up, which helps drive our material analysis business. And on balance, just continued growth throughout the sector, strong margins and cash performance throughout the year.","Next slide. Here we look at the Radio Frequency technology segment. This delivered about $63 million in operating profit on $226 million in revenue. So the revenue, all organic, was up 8%. The toll and traffic business remained very strong, had double-digit growth in the quarter, primarily in three areas, our Florida all-electronic tolling conversion projects, Texas expansion and upgrades to the technology, and higher tag shipments in Florida, Texas and California.","CBORD performed particularly well in the quarter as its recurring revenue was up nicely from some of these project installs we've had over the last several years in a terrific confirmation for continuing license agreements and maintenance with people. And then we had the modest growth we traditionally see out of our SaaS businesses, which had really amazing, an exceptional leverage and cash flow contribution that helps us reinvest to drive our overall growth in the entity.","In the remainder of the year, we think Transcore's backlog will support its continued growth. Project work is continuing as expected throughout the balance of the year from anything we can see. And our quotation activity around the world on projects remains very strong and that's encouraging.","In the software businesses, they're continuing to grow with exceptional margins and we're really starting to see end user increase drive activity. Many times in these businesses, it becomes the early adopters or people who really need to have technological advantage in competing. And now the followers are jumping on the bandwagon, demanding some access to open solutions and being the best provider for those, where our demand and quotations are up at best levels ever.","Our college and university hosting activities have been increasing normally. In the past, they were more reluctant to do hosting than there have been recently and that may be a positive long-term uptick for us.","Next slide. Here we look at the Medical & Scientific Imaging business. It really is a medical business. Imaging is kind of split in two pieces, out scientific business with Gatan and then the camera businesses. Those things together are less than 25% of the segment. So medical is 75% and it's split between medical IP businesses and the medical product businesses. Organic revenue was up 7% in the quarter. So we had double-digit revenue growth at Sunquest as our implementation improvements have really taken hold. We have more people deployed and we have faster turnarounds on them.","MHA continued to benefit from favorable end-markets. The trends and the share gains that they have are driving growth certainly ahead of plan. We've got solid execution growth across all of our medical device platforms with just extraordinary performance from Northern Digital in the first quarter of the year, more than double-digit growth there. Our imaging businesses were better, led by growth in Gatan, so that eased the drag that that has had on our segment in the past and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year.","But we also expect double-digit growth out of Sunquest. We've record backlog at the moment. And we got a terrific sales funnel. That organization continues to mature and deploy resources effectively. So it's going to have really quite exceptional year in 2014. MHA continues as expected. We think the momentum and everything around its core businesses are solid. We have new and enhanced products at Verathon, which are kind of game changing. The early acceptors of that, as we've been showing, is high. And we expect that will drive revenue throughout the rest of this year.","And then we think the imaging businesses for the first time in a long time will have some modest growth that will make the overall segment look better. Gross margins in that segment are very, very high and the EBITDA margins for this segment came in at this time at 43.9%.","Next slide. So here as we look at the guidance outlook for the business as a whole, next slide gets into the detail. We're raising the guidance from what it had been $6.05 to $6.25 for the year to $6.22 to $6.36 on the year. It's a $0.14 increase at midpoint. Our full year tax rate we still expect to be about 31%. It was a little lower, 28% in the first quarter and likely to be closer to 31% in Q2 and unfortunately a little bit higher in the balance of the year. We also think our organic revenue certainly at the bottom will be higher than expected. So we've raised our guidance there from 4% to 7% to 5% to 7%. And established Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.51. But as always, we would tell you that that's an interesting number, but you should follow the cash.","Next slide. If you look at our first quarter, we gad record results in just about every category that you can find. Revenue again was up 13%. Our gross margin was up 120 basis points and operating margin up 130 basis points. EBITDA appeared a run rate far in excess of $1 billion a year. EBITDA margin at 32.8% compared to the S&P 500 industrial gross margins of 28%, which tells you something about how great the businesses we have on our portfolio are.","Our operating cash flow was up 24% to $213 million. And the operating cash flow conversion rate, we said before, was 144%. Free cash flow conversion at 137% on $202 million divided by the shares get you really a spectacular number. And even our net earnings are up to 171.7% of revenue, which is far and away best-in-class. Excellent start to the year. We've raised the guidance. We think the full year will be pretty spectacular as well.","And with that, we'd like to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll have our first question from Deane Dray, Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Solid operating performance across the board whether you look at topline, incrementals or cash. On the look-forward, Brian, you mentioned the $1.7 billion was what you've invested in the last 12 months. You can do that or better in the next 12 months. Maybe some color on the pipeline and maybe address the challenges of how you positioned against private equity bidders.","Brian Jellison","So It was $1.07 billion, not $1.70 billion. So we did $1 billion-and-change and $50 million-and-change for Advanced Sensors. So we did $1 billion deal in total, $1.07 billion. We'd expect to do at least that much over the next 12 months. In terms of what's going on with private equity, basically the debt staples from the banks remain extraordinarily high frequently. There are seven times debt to EBITDA, almost always some number close to that. And their ability to refinance is exceptionally high. So that puts a lot of pressure around prices paid for assets. We've said for a while that gross premium on the tails of those kind of assets are pretty risky, but they're pretty low cost. So those guys are going to continue to stand in rapid rate, paying a lot of money for the things that they're doing.","The kind of businesses that we acquire from (inaudible) aren't really expected by that so much, because when they're exiting particular investment cycle and and sell the business any way, if the business fits in our categories and meets our standards and the management team, it is something that we think works with us, we still have the competitive advantage of being able to deploy capital to buy those assets. So we actually are seeing as much now as we ever have seen in terms of attractive and available things. We don't have a timetable for when our next capital deployment would be, but we're active on a lot of different things. And I'm sure within next 12 months, you'd find us deploying more capital than we did in the prior year.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","And then just on the businesses, I know there's lots of attention about the addition of Sunquest and MHA, but the legacy Software as a Service business, CBORD, maybe you can clarify the point on hosting. So I understand access control. I understand the driving haul. I understand the credit card. But maybe you can expand on the term of hosting activity.","Brian Jellison","What CBORD is at the core a license software company with maintenance and annual fees and revenues and renewals of what we have, because of some of the other things we've done and the ability to convert many more people to a hosted service just like a typical SaaS business would be that we have in an iTrade operation or (inaudible). We continue to look at acquisitions that are in those spaces. And we think some of the budget pressure around college and universities is getting them to find it easier to do some of the work that we do for them in the cloud, where they haven't done much. And we're offering them solutions that they find easy to migrate to. So we have been encouraged by people asking us if we could do more in that arena. Switching is those businesses, it's got a really high switching cost. So it gives us a leg up relative to other people who're trying to enter that market.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","And just to clarify, what percent of that CBORD base today is on a hosted basis and what are the economics?","Brian Jellison","It's still a pretty little number. It's less than 5% of their base primarily in one of their applications called NetMenu, which is really around menu planning and nutritional information and being able to kind of be the front end of starting that food supply chain through those campus locations. And as far as the economics are concerned, I mean economics are really good for CBORD whether you're going with the traditional license plus ongoing maintenance for a more SaaS-based. There's really no different than the customer acquisition cost. And so it's probably a little bit higher, but a little bit load upfront. But largely the economics are going to look very similar to the underlying economics for the CBORD business.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mark Douglas, Longbow Research.","Mark Douglas - Longbow Research","Looking at your guidance on the organic growth, 1Q was the easiest comp and your guidance implies organic growth and continue to maintain this close to the 7% level, your comps are getting more challenged in the second half. Just dive a little bit more into what's giving the confidence in the second half, do you think that'd be that strong, do you some things in the backlog?","Brian Jellison","Sure. First of all, I know what the numbers say, but I'm not sure I would agree with the easy comp in Q1, only because Q1 last year was when we had the biggest variance associated with that loss customer (inaudible). It was not like it was artificially depressed. It just got the run rate as of last year. And we did build some momentum throughout the year. So in some cases, you're correct. But based upon yet another quarter where the book-to-bill is above 1, so we did build some backlog even with the tremendous 7% organic growth in the first quarter. It gives us the confidence. We have continued visibility, pretty good visibility within our toll and traffic area, parts of our energy in the market we have pretty good visibility on. And it's just continued momentum on execution, particularly on medical platform where we not only have the backlog associated with Sunquest and deploying new upgrades to their software customers, but also a couple of new products that are being introduced in our medical products area that we think is going to drive incremental growth there also. So it's the totality of backlog plus ongoing momentum inside of our key end markets.","Mark Douglas - Longbow Research","Talking about the pumps market, curious what's happening in the underlying market. Are you looking at low single-digit growth, mid single, just trying to get a sense of how much of your double-digit growth is new product launch, an increased capacity versus just a product mix maybe outgrowing the market or seems like you're outgrowing the market?","Brian Jellison","Well, I think that we have three discrete pump businesses, each of the three should have a record year this year, each one for different reason. So we have Allweiler pumps in Germany, which is we don't talk a lot about, that has strong demand drivers in India. And it's kind slurry pumps and things that have to do with moving anything from a mining [ph] capacity or whatever. That business is up a little bit.","Then we have our double-digit reference that we made to Roper Pumps where we've been capacity constrained in larger diameter directional drilling, things and that's what this factory solved. So as that comes, will this be taking share from other applications without naming customers would large cables, so that's kind of a guaranteed upside to us. And the underlying core business is okay as well, probably more high single-digit growth in that Roper Pumps business. And then Cornell has fluctuations around rental markets when people are looking to waste water markets and putting together platforms and if you get a little bit more activity of background fracking in gas and they are benefited by that. And it's got a big business in agricultural irrigation projects. It's pretty much a domestic business, a little bit in the Middle East. So it's growing. But I think there've been some people that are in similar spaces to Cornell. We've had pretty decent growth in the first quarter as well.","Operator","We have our next question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Just a couple of questions. Brian, just wondering on medical margins. This is kind of two quarters in a row kind of in the 35% ballpark, extraordinarily strong. I was wondering if there's something mixed effects of something that causes the step-up to this level, or is this kind of normalized run rate we should think about going forward?","Brian Jellison","Well, if you look at those gross profit margins in those businesses and our ability to execute, that probably would answer that question. It is not going to have a lot of difficulty maintaining and improving its margins. The business is well over 75% healthcare IT and medical products now as opposed to being one very strong business like Gatan and scientific instruments and the camera businesses, which have high gross margins but have high R&D expenses, usually double-digit R&D as a function of sales for those businesses because of high price cycles. So yeah, we would expect to have very, very solid margins in the healthcare IT businesses like Sunquest and MHA.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then just coming back around the deals, I mean what you said earlier to Deane's question pretty straightforward, but you do sound more confident. Just kind of reading some of the transcripts from the (inaudible) and everything, it sounds like you're viewing things as much more difficult maybe to get done. What else has changed? Is the complexion of what's available out of private equity changing or is there some other dynamic that raises your confidence level a little bit?","Brian Jellison","I wouldn't say that. I think that we've come close to doing a couple of larger transactions in the first part of the year that for a variety of reasons didn't occur. But yet, we're always involved in things that look pretty attractive and we're aware of things that are happening later on this year that are attractive. There are different reasons why private equity is selling assets. And it's the end of life of a fund and they've got to sell as opposed to recap, they've gone through an unusual period where the cost of debt is so low and the risks and the mezzanine pieces are so mispriced that it's easy for them to recap stuff. But they can't recap that forever. They got to cut the core and if they need the management team to stay in place, then there're only a few people around, Oh, my gosh, that are in the business of acquiring great management teams and making it better. And so that's why we're confident that we're always able to execute and capital deployment. It's just we don't have a budgeted timeframe for saying, let's do $250 million a quarter or we're going to say, no, let's do $1 billion, $1.5 billion or more a year.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Summerville, KeyBanc.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","Just a couple of questions, first on Neptune. That business is up double-digits again. Brian or John, how much of that would you say is market-related versus market share and why or why not should we expect that to continue?","John Humphrey","Inside the quarter, I'm not sure I can make the split between market versus market share. And we continue to execute in Canada for a large Toronto project at a pretty healthy rate. So that's helpful. We generally take a little bit wider lens on the market share question. And I would not say that that has substantially changed. So I suspect most of this is going to be market-driven, but quarter-to-quarter based upon how projects are rolling out new rollouts of fixed network or mobile network implementation of the various cities, we'll move that a little bit. But we're still in the high-30% share range for Neptune.","And there's one of the things that we like about that are switching costs are pretty high. We have a pretty good representation in those areas that are probably disproportionately affected by new housing starts. So that probably over time gives us a little bit of tailwind.","Brian Jellison","If you have new housing starts that are on the uptick as opposed to where they were for a couple of years, we're likely to have a disproportionate share of that because of where new housing starts are. So we have a higher share in places that require water meters because of our technology being dramatically superior to other people's performance. So if you have a hard out location and you're building in the Southeast or Southwest, we're going to have higher than our national share. So we just automatically gain at the expense of others as new housing starts are on the uptick.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","And then just lastly with respect to Verathon, can you provide a little more granularity into some of the new products you're launching there and then just maybe a brief update on what you're seeing in your Dynisco business?","John Humphrey","Sure, I'll take the second one first. I mean Dynisco is doing just fine. It's a more industrial-focused areas, as Brian was talking about inside our energy segment. It was up in a low single-digit range in the first quarter. Pretty good operating performance margins, was up a little bit. With respect to Verathon, what they're doing is really a refresh of a couple of their product lines, coming out with a titanium GlideScope. So it removes some of the plastic. It actually makes it slightly smaller for the intubation insertion, which is a big deal for the doctors and a big deal for the emergency responders. So that's small size difference is actually quite significant in terms of the success rate of being able to have a success for intubation. And then also a little bit later a redesigned BladderScan unit that has significantly higher reliability and performance and ease of use for the nurses. So it's really a refresh of the existing product lines, but with some real fundamental game changers, particularly on the GlideScope side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","You actually had mentioned, I think, in mid-March, you guys were talking about some potential for weather-related disruptions, didn't seem to be the case, but maybe you could just expand on that, maybe you recouped all that in March or something like that, just kind of curious.","Brian Jellison","I think we certainly didn't expect a lot of trouble from the poor weather, but we had to run some over time, but it really worked itself out. We had a little bit more backlog at Neptune than we otherwise would have had, but there wasn't anything material about weather. It's not some big windfall would get from additional shipments in the second quarter, helped a little bit in that respect, but not much. And the costs that we had were immaterial.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then just moving to the businesses on the traditional kind of imaging side, it sounds like you guys are a little more positive on that. I think that was hit hard by the NIH budget last year. Any updates on that business?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, we did better in Japan and had a quite robust Q1 with Japan. But most of those businesses are really non-US businesses other than NIH here. They're okay. They will perform at the lowest level of incremental change or positive organic that we have in the company that may have decent fees relative to last year being a very good year. But you have to remember that more than 75% of that business is really all healthcare. Imaging is sort of split. So you got maybe 10% or so in cameras and 10% or so or a little more than that Gatan in completely different world-class business. The cameras are the ones that really are always waiting on maybe expanding out of Japan and something from China and NIH here. So those are the ones that have the cyclical risk, not the other half, which is Gatan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","When I look out to next year, with the rate guidance now saying the Street number for next year, looks like it's, I don't know, like 5% to 7% EPS growth. There're been a lot that's moved around in your businesses and you had a couple of businesses fall off last year. Maybe there're some moving parts that I'm not accounting for, but is there something about the margins you guys are putting out, means your next year be an unusually weak margin year? I mean it seems like the organic growth is holding up in kind of the mid 5% to 7% range. So that kind of number would imply very limited margin improvement and obviously nobody is taking any kind of real incremental acquisition accretion. So is there anything kind of like unusual about the organic profile you guys put up this quarter and kind of this year that shouldn't kind of carry into the next year? The number seems very low, 5% to 7% EPS growth seems very low.","Brian Jellison","We never put any guidance around EPS growth for 2015. But we'd say we'd expect to do 1.5 to 2 times GDP, certainly have done a little bit better than that now and we might continue to do better for all of this year, could be all of the next year. I think there's a reasonable optimism at the part of our field people. We just maybe do things a little different than some people. We went through our planning process for this year in February. We don't do it in the fourth quarter, because our bonuses are an incremental change year-over-year, not planned performance. So we don't pay off budget plans. We'd be hard pressed to name a business that sees any fall off in 2015 from the planning cycle, but that's a long way away.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Wanted to extend these questions there, if you comment for the revenues, 1.5 to 2 times GDP. Is there a sort of a 1.-something to put on EPS relative to topline growth over the cycle?","Brian Jellison","Look, what we have generally wanted to guide folks, the way to think about that incremental growth is given our margin profile, we would expect that next dollar of revenue to convert to the pre-tax line at somewhere between $0.30 and $0.40, maybe a little bit higher than that in some years, but not lower than that. And so I think if you run the math using that, and this is not really a time for us to be thinking much about 2015. The detailed discussions and strategic plan reviews that we have with our businesses to be able to have a much more informed view of 2015 and beyond, but that's much later in the year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","And then on RF, I'm wondering if the linearity changed at all. You had anticipated heavy project breadth in the first half. Now it sounds like things may be spreading out a little bit more throughout the balance of the year.","Brian Jellison","We still expect RF to be strong in the first half than the second half. And we started some of these projects toward the second half of last year. But overall, of course with the balance of revenue coming from all of our segments, we still feel comfortable that the 5% to 7% for the full year is generally where all four of the segments will be, probably a little bit higher than that in medical. But the other three segments will be in that range of 5% to 7% for the full year.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Just a quick question. On the energy business, when I look in the quarter and I look at the order number, were there any timing issues there or were you comfortable with the orders in the quarter? Sequentially it looked like perhaps were there any weather impact or anything that maybe held those back a little bit in the quarter?","Brian Jellison","No, I don't think there is anything there. Energy's order flow is a little more like our (inaudible) CCC, which is a large player in it. It could be really lumpy. I mean they could get a $20 million order that didn't happen in Q1 and happens in Q2. And it doesn't mean anything. You have to look at that over a kind of 12 month trending period and a trend for them is certainly up.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And then also in IT business, the margins are good, but maybe down a little bit year-over-year. And is that piece of the business, is that where you saw a little bit of weather impact on the margins, just curious how you looked at the margins there in the quarter.","Brian Jellison","Now, that's just Roper Pumps starting up Houston. You really have all the expense at the startup, but we take that period cost and just barely getting started on shipments. So that will write itself right away as we start to ship our product.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Brian, I noticed in the proxy that Roper has petitioned for a change in its gig code. And I'm curious it wasn't mentioned to what, but are we thinking medical technology, are we thinking software?","Brian Jellison","Our primary gig code is now our application software, medical and healthcare IT, medical products and there's some analytical instrumentation, I'm not sure what that gigs code is. But because we have a lot of diversity, the two places they obviously put us into financial, almost capital markets thing, which is where I think they finally just put (inaudible). But in our case, they didn't have to put us in a conglomerate category, so we'll be with Danaher and GE and United Technology and there's like almost six people in there. But unfortunately, they're quite large. I think Carlyle might be in there, I don't know. But that's what we would expect that we would go into the industrial conglomerates, I think it's called. And we would expect that to be announced by the end of the month, I think.","Brian Jellison","We'll just say to make sure from a proxy point, we were an electronic components or something. We don't have a single business in the gigs code to which we were assigned, not a single one.","Operator","Alex Blanton, Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","I wanted to ask you about what you said about the Roper Pumps facility in Houston, because that was your original business and that was originally acquired before you went public by (inaudible) 30 years ago and under continuous improvement, you're still improving it apparently. Could you tell us exactly why your customers are saying that that's a real class best-in-class facility in the world?","Brian Jellison","Because the situation is we got several products in Roper Pumps, some of which are OEM products and some which are now products for the fracking operations, where they're doing drilling. So one of the things that happened is one of the large people in the space acquired another company, Robbins & Myers. I think there are some customers who (inaudible) think they'd rather buy from maybe some other person like us. So we've been approached by people about could we do larger diameter products than we do in our Commerce, Georgia, facility, which is the founding operation of Roper back in the reference you have. And we've had difficulty doing these larger things, because you got to have a couple of cranes. You need some automation. Got to have special heat-treat situations we need to do.","And we had our Alpha instruments business, which is part of Dynisco acquisition that's an instrument company that is a very knowledgeable about rubber and latex. And they came up with a way for us to have a substance that wraps the product that we're making here in a way that allows it to operate at faster speeds and in higher rates of temperature. So it's an entirely new technology for the industry. And that facility will be sole sourced on providing those larger diameter products in that arena. And as it comes online, it will gain share from people that have less effective products now.","And then they get used quickly. They have a short life. And so they get realigned, so by moving to Texas, we're close to the market where people can ship back the drills that can get realigned and go back for second use applications.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","The second question is about what you said about the Russian business. What are you doing in Russia? And also, Asia was up 9%. What's the biggest contribution you're getting from Asia?","Brian Jellison","Well, in Asia, there's three areas of growth for us. I mean everything grows a little bit here. But you have Japan was up this past year on technological purchases. China was up modestly. And India was up sharply somewhat with our pump businesses actually and some instrumentation businesses. So those are the three bellwethers there. In Europe, we did $125 million of revenue in the second quarter and $5 million of that was Russia. So going back to your day, so you would remember with Gazprom being the single most important entity that affected Roper most of the '90s is an irrelevant factor today. So Russia was 4% of the European activity. And how that'll do over the balance of the year with whatever is going to happen politically will be interesting, but it's nothing it used to be where if you had a problem in Russia in Roper in 1995, the business was threat.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","So that seg is a little bit with Gazprom?","Brian Jellison","No, not necessarily. There are people who serve the install base. And so we have products that go into. We also have some products that still go into Russia. So it's just in the energy segment.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you. And once again thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you at the end of our second quarter. Have a good day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","John Humphrey","Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our second quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; Jason Conley, Head of Planning and Investor Relations for us.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.","Now, if you turn to slide two, we begin with our updated Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.","Now, if you please turn to slide three, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Well, good morning everybody. Today, we\u2019ll go through the enterprise financial results for the quarter, talk a little bit about specific segment detail on the outlook for each of the segments, give you an overview of the Sunquest acquisition, and then established our third quarter and full year guidance and take your questions. I think we had indicated in our first quarter call that we expected going into the second quarter would be our most difficult challenge for the year.","We had really an outstanding quarter compared to what we expected, because we had quite a few headwinds this quarter. I\u2019ve certainly had the uncertain economy and we\u2019re able to blow through that. We had very difficult comps going into Q2, because of the Gaz de France. Revenue last year and outsized performance in toll tag shipments last year in our Gatan technology business that we knew wouldn\u2019t be repeated. And then of course, we had currency which became a bigger surprise and we expect it cost us about a $0.01 a share versus our guidance and about $0.02 a share versus the prior year. That said let\u2019s look at what we did in Q2, next slide.","We had record results in the second quarter, pretty well across the board, the highest level of orders in our history, highest level of sales in our history in the second quarter, biggest backlog that we\u2019ve entered the second quarter with record net earnings and record EBITDA performance for the quarter. Our orders were up 8% and revenue was up 4% despite those headwinds and the effect of currency.","Our book-to-bill ratio was actually quite high at 1.05%. Our gross margins reached 54.9% in the quarter and our operating margin was really quite spectacular, it came up 130 basis points to 24.7%. If you look at the incremental OP and the incremental sales, our operating leverage in the quarter was 59%. And there is no smoke and mirrors in that, it\u2019s just 59%.","Our EBITDA was up $214 million \u2013 sorry, was $214 million and our EBITDA margin reached 29.5%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $119 million, slightly lower than we would expect in the second quarter, but we had a higher cash tax rate and that would happen again in the rest of the year. Our first half operating cash flow was $261 million and we\u2019ll project what we believe will be for the full year later this morning. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus a $1.03 last year, that $1.15 would have been $0.01 higher based on our guidance if it weren\u2019t for the currency scenario, and the $1.03 is the number that we use with the re-measurement gain last year, you might remember, was about $0.05 a share, so on GAAP, it would have been $1.08, but was really adjusted at $1.03.","Net earnings were up 13%. We\u2019re very happy with the performance, because we had about a $30 million headwind between our scientific camera business and Gaz de France and some European activity coming into the quarter and we were able to really blow through that, very solid revenue throughout the world with the exception in Europe, which was down about 18%. Record performance really in an uncertain economic environment.","Next slide, in the Q2 income statement, you\u2019ll see orders over $763 million, up 7% organically. Revenue, book-to-bill came in at 1.05%, gross profit was up 100 basis points to 54.9% from 53.9% a year ago and our operating income was an amazing 24.7%, up 130 basis points for a year ago. Our interest expense about flat, tax rate was consistent with the guidance we established for the quarter came in at 29.6%. And net earnings were $115 million versus $102 last year, up 13%.","Next slide, if we look at our EBITDA performance, our trailing 12 months EBITDA has now reached $845 million, it\u2019s up from last year\u2019s trailing number this time at $739 million and two years ago $540 million. So, EBITDA is up 57% over the last two years and our EBITDA margins continued to soar, we were 25.2% in 2010 and 29.3% on the trailing 12 months calculation now and of course this quarter at 29.5%.","Next, if we look here at the cash flow performance, you\u2019ll see Q2 cash flow at $119 million of operating cash flow and $109 million of free cash flow, very good performance again in working capital. Our inventory actually improved by 30 basis points from 7.5% to 7.2% of revenue and our accounts receivable improved by 50 basis points from 15.6% to 15.1%. And when you adjust that for payables and accruals, we were still below 7%.","In the first half cash flow, normally our first half cash flow is about 40% of the full year. This year it\u2019ll \u2013 second half will be even a little stronger because of the acquisition of Sunquest and how cash accretive it really is. So, you can see that our full year operating cash flow, we\u2019ve now raised our guidance to be about $700 million for the full year, that\u2019ll clear operating cash flow at a very high percentage of revenue it could reach 23% of revenue in fact. It\u2019s really driven by expanded margins. It\u2019s driven by the Sunquest acquisition that we expect to close in the last four months of the year. And some cash tax benefits that we\u2019re acquiring in the Sunquest transaction. It does exclude the deal cost and refinancing charges associated with the new credit facility we\u2019ve put in place effective this past Friday. And you can see here that free cash flow, operating cash flow goes up to $700 million. Our estimate this year up from $602 million last year and $500 million the year before, so that would be 40% increase in cash flow over the last two years.","Next slide, on Friday we closed a new credit facility of $1.5 billion revolver. So, if you look at our normal credit stats here a year ago on June 30, 2011, you can see that we had $196 million in cash and $595 million in un-drawn revolver which gave us acquisition powder and investment powder of about $791 million. When we closed out the quarter on June 30, our cash had increased to $519 million on our un-drawn revolver was at its capacity at $750 million giving us $1.269 billion. As of Friday with the new $1.5 billion revolver and the cash from the end of the quarter, we now have capacity in excess of $2 billion. Our gross debt on the other hand is only $1.69 billion.","Our gross debt-to-capitalization is at 23.8, but if you look at the net debt-to-EBITDA you will see it\u2019s actually been cut in half a year ago was 1.4 and at the end of the quarter it was 0.7. Even with the financing of the Sunquest acquisition at $1.4 billion, we\u2019ll have ample capacity to pursue other opportunities in the near term and now the pipeline remains very, very exciting.","If we look next slide here at the Sunquest details \u2013 sorry the segment details, we\u2019ll start with the RF technology slide next. So, on RF technology, really very, very outstanding orders in the quarter, they were up 18%. So, those orders and the execution really in the toll and traffic business kind of got us up to the high-end of our range despite the European pressures and help us deliver.","You can see the OP margin was amazing at 27%, up 290 basis points and if you want to look at leverage, revenue was down 2% and operating profit was up 10%. So, that would speak strongly to the execution, that\u2019s occurring in those businesses. The software businesses continue to help us on the margin expansion as they grow. We got a very significant win again in Houston. We are going to upgrade the entire lane hardware in the Houston area with our United Toll Systems technology, which is really an advancement over what was in place in the past. We think that contract order produced about $65 million in revenue between maintenance and the change out.","Our CBORD cashless system business continued to grow. It had a record quarter in the second quarter for anytime and that involved both university and food management wins in both higher education and healthcare. And we had, of course, this difficult headwind for our technology business, Gaz de France, which had that sort of a one-time large install last year and that held us back by about $5 million in the quarter. In the second half, we\u2019ll have the continued difficult comp with the Gaz de France, because it went throughout the year or last year. But our increased toll project and maintenance activity that will be led by this \u2013 these Texas wins will easily offset any challenges we have in the rest of those types of activities in the segment. And then the software businesses and software-as-a-service activity is continuing to increase and both iTrade and freight matching continue to roll along with the sort of nominal organic growth, but outstanding cash growth.","Next slide, if we look at the Industrial Technology segment, here just again spectacular performance there. Revenue was up 11%. The operating profit margins reached 30.4%, that\u2019s an all-time record for the segment. The highest previous we ever had was a 29.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, this 30.4% to just add some perspective around how amazing it is, the S&P 500 Industrials gross margins as a group were 30.8%. Roper\u2019s operating profit for Industrial is 30.4%. So, we got an all-time record here in OP margin \u2013 again, leverage off the growth, terrific execution everywhere. Food handling continues to grow in both agricultural food and the shale activity. Our general industrial markets have performed well. We are not seeing any early indicators of any softness on any of those businesses.","The material test business, which is primarily a European business actually had a record second quarter, very strong North America and Asia sales offset any weakness that we had in Europe. The Neptune business continued to grow, driven by the Toronto project and some higher shipments in the U.S. In the second half of the year, we would expect that the shale activity growth would moderate, not stall, but certainly moderate with gas activity on shale being down, but the oil activity on shale being up. The industrial end-markets again no signs of any fall off. The outstanding margins we expect to continue throughout the second half of the year, and just a personal note to all our people in Industrial, we just couldn\u2019t be more proud of these teams as we watch them execute in a very tough market.","Next slide, we look at our Energy Systems and Controls business, here you can see revenue was up 6%, OP up 7%, margin at 26%, was up 200 basis points from the first quarter margin in energy. Organic growth in the quarter was 5%.","Compressor controls continues to do very well on LNG projects and the field service activity that we do drove double-digit growth for them. The bolt-on acquisitions that we did in the last are very small United Control Group, Trinity, and Cambridge. All have non-cash amortization charges in them. They are actually putting a little bit of a drag on the OP margins, even though at 26%, it\u2019s hard to see a drag, but they actually would have been about 120 basis points higher on OP without a lot of amortization drag and integration on those three businesses. That said, they are performing well, they are all on plan from an integration view point, they will add the growth in the second half of the year. Our European markets weakened, in fact in the energy they were down about 18%, but our U.S. was up by about 18%. So, they \u2013 U.S. business being larger that was a benefit and the rest of the world was quite strong in the Middle East, and Asia, Australia, Brazil not quite as strong.","Our targeted cost actions are underway for the second half on a very selected basis for people who are executing some contingency plans in those things that relate to any softness that they see. We think Europe continued to be soft, but we\u2019ll have continued growth in both North America and Middle East and Asia to offset that. With the exception of our Petrochem business which was down about 20% and that\u2019s a worldwide shortfall. We\u2019re not seeing any strength anywhere in that business. Very solid backlog though compressor controls gives us confidence of that growth in the second half and then we would expect normal very strong Q4 seasonal activity in energy would be repeated this year.","Next slide, so here we\u2019ll look at Medical and Scientific Imaging. This is one of those things where it looks like nothing happened, but there is great variability throughout the different businesses here and while revenue was flat and operating margin was up 20 bps. What really was going on is the Europe and the North American academic resource funding softness impacted our camera portion of the Photonics business, as cameras are not a big part of Roper, but they do come in around $125 million to $140 million worth of total revenue. And they were down as much as 20% in some cases. And we don\u2019t see any real turnaround as it relates to those research markets for the camera technology businesses. And while we perform relatively well there is certainly a drag on the short-term growth.","Our medical businesses continued to grow organically. The channel expansion we\u2019ve been able to provide them in Asia is offsetting any weakness that they have in Europe. And the Northern Digital business performed very well expanding its offerings to OEM customers. And also we were able to do a Bolt-on acquisition in the quarter, called Ascension Technology Corporation, which is in upstate Vermont. And Ascension does 3D tracking for minimally invasive surgery which you probably all know is a rapidly growing aspect in surgical applications. We paid about $18 million for Ascension, we expected to deliver $3 million plus in EBITDA over the next 12 months.","In the second half, we expect to have continued weakness in this academic research area, which will affect our Photonics businesses. Fortunately, the medical expansion is going to continue, our markets remain pretty favorable. Ascension will give us a little bit of gross work for Northern Digital. The Gatan business has a substantial backlog, which we expect to be able to shift during the second half of the year which will add to our growth. And then we have this transformational Sunquest acquisition which will add substantial amount of revenue and EBITDA to our medical platform. We would expect it will add somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million of revenue in the last four months of the year. It\u2019s going to add well over 35% to the Medical and Scientific segment for the next year in revenue. It\u2019s going to add quite a substantial amount to the Roper\u2019s overall revenue base for 2013.","Next slide, so as we look at the Sunquest acquisition, I\u2019ll talk a bit about the transaction and John will talk a little more in depth about the specific business. Next slide, so if we look at the Sunquest acquisition, you can see that it meets all of our acquisition criteria, it\u2019s really an amazing fit where we are able to take our software platforms inside RF and the medical platforms inside Medical and Scientific imaging and hook them up in a very creative way with the Sunquest business, which is truly a software business, but it\u2019s also a medical business. If you look at our criteria, we talk about all the time asset like low CapEx absolutely, it\u2019s almost no CapEx and exceptionally light asset business.","Focusing on the market structures and driving forces at work, we\u2019ve done probably more marketplace diligence on this business because we actually looked at it in 2010 and have maintained 100% of business forever and really felt that based on the work that we have done and things that we thought they could and should be looking at and then seeing how they\u2019ve done. Our diligence revealed a lot of strategic competitive advantages that Sunquest enjoys and they have a lot of wide space opportunities for growth that are beyond their core traditional business. They\u2019ve done a great job in transforming their business that was acquired by Vista in 2007 and certainly was high margin business, but could be better and to the Sunquest leadership team\u2019s efforts, they have done an incredible job in making that a transformational business that we are acquiring now compared to what it was in 2007.","The incentives as always are linked to the commitments that their leadership teams made and those are in place. It has technology advantages that are clear and easily measured against competition and has very deep application expertise. It really is a niche business in the lab market. Management continuity as always is valued, and everybody on that team has agreed to stay in place. The communication for the Sunquest employees is taking place this morning in Tucson.","We\u2019ve asked them as always to preserve what\u2019s made them a very good company in core values, but stimulate progress. In this area, the progress is going to come in the form of even more investment in the sales and marketing arena and some faster execution in the development area. This is a business that when we talk about growing what you buy, my goodness, this business has higher margins than been we do. It has twice the EBITDA margins that Roper enjoys. And when you look at those kind of margins and you recognize the incredible strength of the company, it has two-thirds of its revenue comes on a recurring basis. 98% of its customers sign up annually for the software programs that it has. It has negative working capital and very low CapEx and we expect in 2013 that it will generate $140 million or more EBITDA for us.","The fourth quarter run-rate, which we just completed their fiscal company May 31st and just had their audit and signed up prior to our closing actually supports our expectations for \u201813 \u2013 2013 nicely. It\u2019s really a business when John talks about, if you want to kind of think about well, what do they do and where are they located and why did they win, because it is a phenomenal management team and outstanding group of employees that have really done things in the space that no one can really replicate.","So, with that, we\u2019ll turn into next slide and John Humphrey.","John Humphrey","Sure. Thanks, Brian. So, I\u2019ll just talk a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it\u2019s able to provide for its customers. Those are the global market leaders for providing the underlying software and information solution for laboratories and hospitals and large academic medical centers, with a headquarter in Tucson, Arizona, locations both in the UK and a development center in Bangalore. They have a global footprint that allows them to serve that customer base, really, their customer base are those folks who \u2013 for whom the effectiveness and efficiency of the lab is of critical importance.","The lab ends up with in many cases hundreds of thousands of tests being done each month to support the diagnostic decisions that are made in a hospital. And they rely upon the Sunquest information and the quality and safety associated with that to help drive those decisions. The comprehensive solutions is about improving the productivity with workflow automation tools, you see on the right hand side both the Sunquest laboratory 7.0 and the CoPath solution. Both of those are about workflow automation to make sure that the right test is done on the right patient at the right time, leading to the right diagnosis. So, those things also reach beyond just the lab and also go out to the collection manager, which is one of the modules that Sunquest has. So, that nurse has a point of collection tool that integrates back with the lab, so you have full connectivity between both of those parts of the hospital.","The very large customer base, very high retention rates, over 98% retention each year, continue to utilize and depend upon the software set of solutions and fully supported by a 30-year history. And these are very long-term relationships, relationships that are supported by the decades of application expertise. The Sunquest has developed about what the hospital lab needs and their unique set of needs that Sunquest is going to be able to meet.","And as Brian talked about, it is a proven team, it\u2019s a great culture everything that we\u2019ve learned during the diligence process continues to support the fact that their culture of excellence of execution is really phenomenal and I think they\u2019re going to be a great addition to the team. And I think the company is very well-positioned to capture the growth opportunities that they\u2019ve identified over the coming years.","So, with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Brian to talk a little bit about guidance and summary for the quarter.","Brian Jellison","Okay. So, after we get that title sheet on guidance, we\u2019ll move to the guidance slide. We\u2019ve raised our full-year guidance to $4.84 to $5 that reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91, you might remember. $0.04 comes off the bottom here, $0.0471 or $0.05 off the top here for 86 and we\u2019re adding back $0.12 to $0.14 on a GAAP accretion for Sunquest excluding any of the deal cost. And then in addition of course we\u2019ve got other things that we\u2019re absorbing and other things that are good. So $4.84 to $5 on full-year guidance, the quarter comes in at $1.19 to $1.25 in the third quarter.","Most importantly really is that we now expect our full-year operating cash flow to be approximately $700 million. And just a couple of footnotes you\u2019ll notice there, the acquisition of Sunquest, we expect to close at the end of August will have the HSR filing and since there is no competitive issues, it should move along quickly.","We have some deferred revenue that\u2019s unusual in Sunquest, similar to some other businesses when you acquire them there are some GAAP issues around that. And so we\u2019ll have to kind of reveal that huge quarter as we report out. And this does exclude whatever cost we will have that will be registered in the third quarter that would be related to the acquisition and removal of the remaining amortization and the old revolver.","Next slide, so looking at the summary of the second quarter, we go back to the top point being that it\u2019s again an all-time record for any second quarter in our history, highest level of orders, revenue backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Organic order growth at 7% was really a pleasant benefit for the quarter, the operating margins at 24.7%, the EBITDA, 29.5%, and gross margins at 54.9%, really terrific. Leverage is kind of breathtaking at 59%. We used to talk about 30% to 35% of leverage and it\u2019s hard to see how our leverage isn\u2019t going to be above 40% for a long time.","Doing a new revolver, big help, $1.5 billion as the older revolver was put in place in July of 2008 and would have the deal replaced in July of 2013. So, this removes any refinancing risk around that for next year. It gives us twice as much capacity to write checks against as we had previously and $1.5 billion is pretty sizable revolver for Roper. That was completed last Friday, a timely completion we might add relative to the deal closing on Saturday.","Sunquest, just an exceptional financial profile, higher gross margins than we have twice the EBITDA margins. Terrific that you couldn\u2019t find a business that\u2019s sort of marry what we\u2019re doing in software and what we\u2019re doing in Medical that would benefit both so much as Sunquest. It\u2019s got a great development people. Our software people spent last week in Bangalore, visiting and talking with people. We\u2019ve done tremendous diligence around the robustness of the software platforms in place for Sunquest and how they can be used. All of this then creates an opportunity for us to be positioned again in 2012 for an all-time record year. $700 million in operating cash flow and perhaps most importantly that a transformation process that we\u2019re doing here continues as we get more and more technology.","You think about where we are now, we\u2019ve continued this. We\u2019ve more technology content, we have higher margins, higher cash returns, more recurring revenue and it\u2019s just a much different company than what you\u2019d looked at 2002. And in the next five years, we added Neptune and TransCore.","And then if you look at 2007 and you look at the forward five years here till 2012 you\u2019ve picked up Seaboard and Horizon and I-Trade, and Technolog and now Sunquest. So, the technology content gets better margins, get better cash return, gets better and available forward acquisition power for growth will be better than it ever has been in the past.","And with that, I think we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Matt Summerville, KeyBanc.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Good morning.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Matt.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","I just wanted to clarify something Brian on Sunquest, a $0.12 to $0.14 is that a GAAP number that we\u2019ll have under GAAP rules, the deferred revenue adjustments, I just want to make sure I have that right?","John Humphrey","That is a \u2013 Matt, this is John. That\u2019s a non-GAAP number. So, as you are probably aware like an awful lot of software companies, Sunquest has deferred revenue for the annual maintenance. They get paid in advance for that.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Sure.","John Humphrey","And the accounting rules upon acquisition will require us to take a write-down of that. So, to basically move that deferred revenue to fair value and then over the next 12 months as those renewals happen, that deferred revenue will get built back up. So, the $0.12 to $0.14 is a non-GAAP number. And as we are able to estimate exactly what that deferred revenue fair value adjustment is, then we\u2019ll be able to provide that for you. We will be able to do that until after we closed the business, but we\u2019ll be providing that insight each quarter. So, you are able to reconcile between the GAAP numbers and then the non-GAAP numbers that we think provide better visibility in understanding the operations of the company.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Perfect.","Brian Jellison","The great news though is the cash is the cash.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Absolutely. Brian, could you maybe spend a minute talking about just more broadly for Roper\u2019s, you moved through Q2, how would you characterize the overall demand environment for your businesses and then how are orders so far in July from what you\u2019ve seen?","Brian Jellison","I think really the quarter from our organic \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have given ourselves so much of a shot that had been 7% organic. Orders in the quarter that was a pleasant surprise, but we got really strong activity that we knew we\u2019d eventually come in the year wouldn\u2019t have necessarily seen in the quarter, so that helped. I think we entered the quarter with more concern and turned out to be justified. So, those any like early indicators of things that would make us nervous, that would be in energy or industrial, we really haven\u2019t seen that. There is just a little bit of activity mostly in petrochem and oil and gas that we are going to do some very modest internal retrenchment all in, but on balance, it\u2019s pretty good. We never really talk about a quarter in which we\u2019re in, but I would say, things remain pretty decent. We\u2019re going to expect organic growth that actually kind of picked up in the second quarter and we would expect it to continue to be mid-single digits really for the rest of the year. So, it\u2019s really kind of better than we expect, because there is more European headwinds than we would have originally forecast.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","How much was your European business down in the quarter?","Brian Jellison","It was down 18% for us in total, about a half of that is just due to currency though, so maybe 8% or 9% on an organic basis.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","John Humphrey","One thing to remember on that Matt is that does include the headwind associated with Gaz de France, so that\u2019s got $5 million, but even once you take that out, we saw a decline in Europe that was definitely mid-single digits.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Got it. Thanks John.","John Humphrey","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mark Douglass, Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Hello. Good morning.","Brian Jellison","Hey good morning, Mark.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","So, on the Sunquest, Brian, you talked about there is a lot of wide space, you talk about what that would look like, I mean is it market share shift, is it just under-penetrated as far as the clinics and hospitals or is it geographies?","Brian Jellison","Well, I think we don\u2019t want to tip off other people to things that we think are available to us, but it would be safe to say that we think that they can continue to grow share at the expense of other people. We think people have been paying a lot of attention to electronic health records and companies that are in the EHR space. Here again, we picked out a niche that we think is unrelated to that activity. And this niche has got an opportunity, very high return for people investing in this in the hospital space and in the clinic space and in private care space. Basically the lab work is critical to every aspects of people, diagnosing folks and it happens at a variety of different places. We think we have the pre-eminent technology to do that. And we think we can make people more productive and more efficient in what they do when they do it.","It has been hard, I think the last couple of years to get the attention, hospitals that have had these mandates to do a variety of thing around health records, now they get a chance to make an investment and things like this business that will give them an actual return. So, we think it\u2019s got pretty exciting growth.","And these guys they brought in a new sales executive women in who we have great confidence in that we think it\u2019s going to drive better focus on organic growth, it\u2019s been a very high cash contributor. And it\u2019s same old situation, private equity has done in this case of a really amazing job with this business versus what they acquired in \u201807, but it can grow one and it has \u2013 it does have opportunities for share gain and expansion around the world. I mean this business it doesn't do much in certain portions as the world and we do a lot in other portions of the world that they do. It\u2019s also got an incredible development team in Bangalore and that's very, very bullish for us.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay and then want to give too much away on them I suppose, what are this for the industries at least typically growth rates, what kind of returns are you assuming as you model it out over the next three to five years?","Brian Jellison","For a Sunquest kind of thing?","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Yes.","Brian Jellison","Oh, I think it ought to \u2013 it will grow its cash and EBITDA double-digits. Revenue, just kind of year forward revenue is probably go to work by 10%. We would think over time that it grows revenue, remember it\u2019s got this massive recurring business right. So, in fact new business won\u2019t look like a high number. So, if you have got couple of hundred million of constant business, it could grow its net new business by 20% and it wouldn\u2019t look like a big number on the core business, right. So, it\u2019s not like looking at a cyclical company that\u2019s up and down and looking at various trends. This is just as it starts with its Q4 and then each quarter it gets better all the time.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Deane Dray, Citi Research.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Brian Jellison","Hey good morning.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Brian, I\u2019d be interested in hearing what the lessons you\u2019ve learnt from iTrade and how that played into both the negotiation for Sunquest, but also integration, managing a software company and so forth?","Brian Jellison","We have a big advantage today versus when we first took on iTrade in that we have recently hired a Chief Architect for our technology businesses. He is working in our software arena. We also have a software executive full time that\u2019s looking over a various software companies. And we have a medical executive which we didn\u2019t have before looking over the medial scenarios. So, between the two new executives, someone that\u2019s a domain expert in medical and one that\u2019s a domain expert in software and the architectural person, the quality of our diligence that we\u2019re able to do on our own was a dramatic improvement. We have a much deeper understanding about source code and the ways in which development programs need to be done and measured.","And we\u2019ve got a deeper understanding about cost structures around development activity. And all those things were good. I think we\u2019ve also come to recognize that slightly lower organic growth rates in the software businesses really aren\u2019t a problem because of the recurring revenue that they have inside them and the quality of the cash that they generate. I mean to look at a company I think most people would look at us and say this is best-of-breed EBITDA margins and yet here we\u2019re acquiring one that has twice the margins that we enjoy. So, they were fundamentally different and our executive leadership capability around them is better than ever.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","And just to clarify on the deferred revenues, you said that it refers to the maintenance side of it, is that two years it\u2019s pretty typical that you\u2019re seeing three years of maintenance fees and are any of the licensing fees included in that deferred revenues or just maintenance?","John Humphrey","So, the short answer is nothing on the license fees and the maintenance contracts and the differed revenue are two slightly different things. So, the maintenance agreements range anywhere from one-year, three-year, five-year, some of them even seven-year agreements because of course the customer would like to make sure that they have kind of the long-term commitment with Sunquest. And Sunquest might have in the long-term contracts so, but they don\u2019t pay for all seven years or all five years upfront. So it\u2019s a one-year payment and that\u2019s what goes into the differed revenue so, we would expect to see that differed revenue build backup after the fair value adjustment after 12 months to be back to the normal steady state.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great, just last one from me on the $25 million in cash tax benefits, well, what\u2019s the duration of that asset, will it be used up first year or are you restricted in how much you can draw down.","John Humphrey","We will be utilizing that in 2012.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great, thank you and congratulations.","John Humphrey","Alright.","Operator","We will go next to Terry Darling, Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning, Terry.","John Humphrey","Good morning, Terry.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And congratulations on Sunquest.","Brian Jellison","Thank you.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So couple of follow-ups there, in terms of thinking about accretion for 2013, any reason not to on a non-GAAP basis as you are presenting it here, $0.13 for four months, 10% plus revenue growth profile, anything outside the scope of that as we annualize those numbers that we ought to be aware off.","Brian Jellison","Notably so. Just to remember on the growth profile that you want to be careful on the revenue growth profile, you are going to have that massive baseline, so it\u2019s just the net new that grows, right. So, we will have a double-digit organic growth on the non-recurring revenue side and we will have double-digit EBITDA growth.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that is helpful. And then the interest rate on the new revolver, John, do you have that.","John Humphrey","Yeah, we do. It\u2019s basically the same as what we have now on a drawn basis, the jump was 125, the facility fee is 15 basis points so, the un-drawn portion is 15 bps.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then in terms of the changes in the outlook for 2012 on the base business, Brian, you had called out that there were some minuses offset by some pluses and all that kind of rounded to where you were before. But I\u2019m wondering if you can just kind of go through the list here on both the plus and the minus side, you have been very clear on the energy piece with the petrochem and oil and gas component. The RF margins look a little stronger, perhaps that\u2019s a plus up the industrial margins, perhaps that\u2019s a plus up the RF Europe. On the technology side, you call that as a negative, am I missing any of the other pieces within that context.","Brian Jellison","I would say that it\u2019s probably only one you might have missed is that the camera business is specifically that are serving the academic research markets probably a little bit worse than even what we had handicapped three months ago. So seeing them down kind of in the high-teens in the second quarter and frankly not a lot of encouraging signs in there in the market as we look forward to the third quarter, probably a little bit of incremental headwind. But once again offset by some of the pluses that we have seen in RF and some of the better margin performance.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then in terms of the second half for organic growth in the mid single-digits, you are much tougher comp obviously in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Do you expect mid singles for both quarters or would that comp profile suggest a little tougher 3Q.","Brian Jellison","Probably similar throughout the second half.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. And then just lastly, can you help us with what iTrade organic was in the quarter, presumably with the Europe comment that might have been down. But can you just clarify on that for us.","Brian Jellison","No iTrade was up organically in the quarter.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks, good morning.","Brian Jellison","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","On the RF order, they were pretty striking, I think you called up some new strength in toll and traffic, I don\u2019t know if that was mainly related to Houston. But any signs you are entering sort of a new era of growth for that business and brought interest on the road conversion.","Brian Jellison","Well, you are happy to find new era. So, it\u2019s the one big area that\u2019s alive and well for those activities. There are a lot of initiatives. There are a number of things that\u2019ll come out for bid. I think the longer we go with people learning more and more about our United Toll Systems technology, the more and more people recognize that it is dramatically superior to what other people have done for a long period of time including ourselves. So, the lead time for getting agencies to understand and see and test and kick tires around that is kind of long. But in terms of long-term growth vehicle, nobody\u2019s got a better mouse trap than us and I don\u2019t think anybody is going to get one. So, we like the long-term nature of the business and we certainly like the second quarter and we think the rest of the year will be fine.","John Humphrey","And just to put a little more color on that Chris, for instance the win in Harris County is not a conversion from a non-tolled to a tolled lane or a new road is being constructed. It\u2019s really an upgrade of the technology and so it\u2019s a technology insertion and maintenance for the equipment that\u2019s already on those roads. So, it\u2019s really just building out our maintenance and support capabilities with the team that we have rather than net new if you will.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Understood and then on Neptune, wondering if you\u2019re starting to see an impact on new resi and how you think about the opportunity for residential recovery on the Neptune business if you could contextualize that a little bit?","Brian Jellison","Well, if that happens it\u2019ll be great. I mean getting 700,000 housing starts is better than 400,000. It\u2019s not as good against getting a million for. So, we\u2019re hopeful and I wouldn\u2019t say much if anything is baked into our guidance around stronger housing start thing. But if it happens, that will definitely \u2013 we would think that certainly benefit us in 2013.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Great, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yes. Good morning. Brian, could you just speak for a minute or two about the RF segment EBIT, significant jump in the quarter on the growth rate that was slightly negative. Is that \u2013 first of all is that mix or secondly is that and maybe also was that sustainable at that level as we move forward?","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s very sustainable, here one of the things Richard you might note, if you want to get in trouble at Roper, you come in from operations and you say well we had a mix variance. Okay, so we know exactly where it came from in every one of the businesses and certainly we have tightened up our execution in the TransCore toll business and have better margins as a result of that activity which has showed out terrific work that\u2019s been done really by George McGraw, our Amtech business and some work that\u2019s been done in IPS business. That said software tends to grow at a faster cliff than our friends do and the rest of the product measure of RF and as it grows it carries with an extraordinary margins compared to the product businesses.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","So again, given where we booked backlog if it\u2019s partly Houston and it\u2019s been on the tolling side, we can expand that business in the second half off of this 27% EBIT margin?","Brian Jellison","I think that\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t do that if I were in your shoes, I\u2019ll put it that way. I mean we have\u2026","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","","Which is up in my shoes, so that\u2019s not a good assumption.","John Humphrey","No, I don\u2019t believe so. So, I mean clearly IPS has improved their operating performance and their margins. But, we haven\u2019t changed the underlying economics of the fact that maintenance of toll and road services doesn\u2019t carry the same type of margin profile as our software businesses or as hardware photo applications. So, as we continue to do more on the tolling, maintenance and service side, we will have a \u2013 I won\u2019t say mix because Brian will kick me, but we\u2019ll have a variance associated with the relative growth rates of those businesses.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then on the industrial tech side, just given that much of the leverage came at the SG&A line to get the EBIT leverage that you delivered, is it fair to assume that Toronto was finally a significant contributor in the quarter?","John Humphrey","I mean Toronto was a nice contributor in each of the quarters.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","","Okay. Was there any cost take-out visible on the SG&A line there? So, again in this space, you did comment about Europe weakness on the materials analysis side and some other things, but I am just again a little bit curious as to where the SG&A leverage came from? Is that take-out or is that?","John Humphrey","We just \u2013 the SG&A, it is drive revenue growth. And so when you are largely selling direct and you got the best technologies than anybody and you\u2019ve got solid gross margins, you get the leverage on incremental revenue. So, we got some incremental revenue, we get the leverage.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. Okay, thank you.","John Humphrey","Okay.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Brian Jellison","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Hey, just a couple things. Brian, it sounded like the pipeline is fairly active despite biting off this nice big chunk here, should we expect more before the year end?","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t really know Jeff, it\u2019s possible. I wish or wouldn\u2019t rule against it. I know what we are willing to do. You never know what other people are willing to do. So, usually a bit outspread all the time when we are doing work. This transaction with Sunquest demonstrates kind of how we act right, so I mean, we started talking to these people in 2010 and we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you sometimes we\u2019ll get people ideas or whatever we wonder about what they are going to do, I think these people have done just a spectacular job of taking advantage of some momentum that we thought could be available to them. And they\u2019ve done that. So, we have some transactions that are similar to this that we have been talking to people off and on about for several years.","I think that depending on who owns the asset and what peoples think is going to happen between now and the end of the year around the tax structures going into next year. You have higher levels of seller activity if they believe nothing is going to change and they don\u2019t have capital gains if they are worried about, they may hold on. On the other hand, they think that getting a high percentage of something is better than a lower percentage of something else. We may close the valuation gap, I don\u2019t know. So, I think it\u2019s possible that we would do another transaction, probably not quite as large as $1.4 billion, however.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I would bet not, but that brings up another topic. What are you thinking about on the divestiture side, not naming names, of course, but clearly, the portfolio is changing this, maybe some pieces out of that are as not as core they used to be. It\u2019s an interesting juncture right, I mean, your returns are so high anything you divest is dilutive, but at the time when you got maybe such accretive acquisition activity going on, perhaps there is an opportunity to move the portfolio a little bit differently. Are you thinking that way at all, is there any prospect for something leaving the portfolio in the next 6, 12 months?","Brian Jellison","Well, our core business is delivering a tremendous amount of cash. They have gotten dramatically better. Their cash returns are more than 50% better than they were like five years ago. They give us tremendous EPS performance, because they don\u2019t have the non-GAAP amortization charges way against them. There is certainly an increasing inflection point, where you look at this and say what about this situation. We are in a marvelous place, where since we have maintained the autonomy of each one of these businesses.","We can always decouple a business and not have any problem doing that. It\u2019s not like some other strategic that\u2019s got everything so embedded that one factory is making five items and one information system can\u2019t go with the business. So, all our businesses are total, isolated and independent and anyone could be spun-off to another party. I think people largely have some ideas about which things might become available, kind of like the trade deadline right for Tuesday. So, depends who is willing to pay what, but we are not an active seller, but we have some assets that are probably more valuable to others than they are to us.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then just one final one for John, just on the EBITDA for Sunquest, does that $140 million include associated DA that comes with the acquisition accounting or is that the organic number?","John Humphrey","Well I mean since the EBITDA excludes the effect of amortization, I don\u2019t think it really impacts that. Having said that the accretion number for the back half this year, the $0.12 to $0.14 that we expect, that does include the new amortization that we are estimating that we will absorb and then start to record post acquisition. So, on the EPS side, it definitely does include that of course always with the caveat it does not include the impact of the deferred revenue, fair value accounting treatment.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Could you just kind of clarify for us how much EBIT is in that $140 million EBITDA number next year?","John Humphrey","Well, here is \u2013 we have to finalize.","Brian Jellison","$35 million.","John Humphrey","Amortization, so I\u2019d say if utilization comes in at $35 million to $40 million to $100 million of\u2026","Brian Jellison","Roughly $35 million.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.","John Humphrey","And I think we\u2019ll \u2013 one more question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alex Blanton, Clear Harbor Asset Management.","John Humphrey","Hello.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yes. I think you\u2019ll have to speaker him, okay. Can you hear me?","John Humphrey","Yes.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","First I wanted to ask you about the Industrial Technology business and the Pump business specifically. Another company recently recorded a substantial decline in orders as Gardner Denver in the petroleum and industrial pump business and that particular business of theirs orders were down 36% in the quarter. And then in another division they had a pressure pumping order decline of 17%. And you haven\u2019t seen anything like that, according to what you said, do you compete with them or are you taking market share or just what is going on here, because the two results are dramatically different?","Brian Jellison","Yeah, I think the markets we\u2019re focused on are totally different for the most part than Gardner Denver, I mean we do have de-watering pumps that Cornell makes and those have certainly been used in the shale activity. Those have had strong growth, that growth is moderating, but it\u2019s not totally negative at all. That\u2019s pretty small part of the overall enterprise and our Roper Pump business continues to grow quite substantially. So, I think \u2013 gosh, I\u2019m not really at all close to Gardner Denver but I\u2019m \u2013 I think they\u2019re building a lot of stuff that maybe is going into rental and platforms and that stuff. We have some rental business with Cornell, but it\u2019s not the core component of what we do. So, we\u2019re still making pumps for waste water activity, agriculture or irrigation and those kind of things.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay. Thank you. And second question is on the orders for RF technology, TransCore on July 19, said they were awarded Texas Department of Transportation Statewide Toll System integration and maintenance contract, replacing one of your competitors and you\u2019ve get to replace all of their systems plus add your own to new systems that come on board. So, you didn\u2019t mention this, I don\u2019t believe. It seems to be a different project than the one you talked about in RF technology. Could you talk about this new TransCore business that was announced July 19?","John Humphrey","Sure Alex and you are correct it\u2019s not the same one. The Hextra business of the Harris County is the one that we talked about. What you\u2019re referring to is the TxDOT, which operates a different set of toll lanes across the State of Texas. Anyway, I\u2019ll be providing them with software and maintenance activity. More of a \u2013 it\u2019s an indefinite quantity, indefinite timing, so it\u2019s in IDIQ type of contract. And so it doesn\u2019t have the same immediate booking that the more definite execution for the Harris County does. So we expect the Texas contract to \u2013 sorry the TxDOT contract to add maybe $30 million over the next three years, but at a timing that may be a little bit lumpy as they decide on when to update and when to update their specific lanes.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay.","Brian Jellison","It just validates the strength of our technology. I think people just \u2013 I\u2019m not sure by understand the strength of our technology compared to others and increasingly they are going to learn that","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations on the Sunquest.","Brian Jellison","Thank you very much, Alex.","John Humphrey","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","That ends our question-and-answer session for this call. We would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Humphrey for any additional or closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning.

Roper Industries' Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call will begin now. I will turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Tina, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss results of our record second quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com.","Next slide, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Now if you'll please turn to slide three, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a GAAP basis. Prior period results are presented on an adjusted basis for comparison purposes. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.","Now if you'll please turn to slide, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. So we open up here, if we look at our enterprise financial results for the quarter, they were once again truly outstanding. We had all time record orders, record backlog, closing out the quarter, record revenue within the quarter, record net earnings in a quarter and of course, another record for EBITDA performance.","Our revenue was up 13% in the quarter on a GAAP basis but 10% on an adjusted basis, which is the way we really look at the quarter. Organic revenue was quite substantial plus 8%. For us it was very broad based, all four segments were up organically, which was nice to see, but certainly, medical and RF had blow up kind of performance on an organic basis.","Our gross margins just continued to go up. It is a remarkable achievement, up 120 basis points to 59.1%, which is really why we call a Roper Technologies this days and not Roper Industries.","Operating profits up 18% to $247 million in the second quarter. Our operating margins up another 180 basis points, clearly above the gross margin improvement and 120 basis points, and operating margin came in at 27.9%, which includes a lot of amortization too. Hope so you add that on top of, I know, the number is even stronger.","Our DEPS in the quarter on an adjusted basis were $1.56 GAAP against last year\u2019s adjusted number were up 19% on a GAAP basis, GAAP to GAAP were up 41%.","And operating cash flow in the quarter was an additional $141 million, which was 14% better than the prior year. So we are very well-positioned to show record year in 2014 for the company along with delivering just an outstanding second quarter.","Next slide, if we look at the income statement, you can see that even though we had a very strong revenue quarter up 10% with organic gain. Our book-to-bill was virtually 1, little bit of lumpiness in RF with TransCore. We will talk about but that\u2019s not unusual.","If we look at the gross profit as we said it went up from 57.9% in the second quarter of last year to 59.1% in this quarter and operating margin went up from 26.1% last year to 27.9% this year, interest expense was a tagged less and our tax rate was just little bit lower than it was a year ago 70 bps. Net earnings we talked about it $156 versus $131 were really again broad based on a segment by segment basis.","Nest slide, here if we look at the EBITDA growth and the trend in the company. We tend to show you a couple years of trailing results at a time, pretty well served to remained people, if you go back to 2003, our EBITDA was about $125 million, not the $1,153 billion that you see now on a trailing basis.","And our EBITDA margins were in the high-teens, not the 33.5% you see today. So that\u2019s why the company really has become much more of the technology company with higher margins, more sustained than continued performance.","And these very high margins up 420 basis points on an EBITDA basis and the last two years alone really allow us to reinvest internally for growth at a much faster pace than Roper would have been able to do 10 years ago or even five years ago.","If you look at the gross margins, which were probably I don\u2019t talk enough about, you can see in 2012, trailing 12 months performance was 54.6% gross margins. Back in the 10 years ago gross margins were always higher at Roper say 50% or so. But, certainly, didn\u2019t have the kind of reinvestment in gross strategy back than that we do today. 450 basis point improvements in gross margin is something we are very proud of over the last two years.","Next slide, if we look at the cash flow, cash flow in the quarter, $414 million of operating cash flow and $130 million free cash flow, really resulted from the fact that we had very little cash tax due in the first quarter about $25 million and we had $132 million of cash tax here.","As economics patriots we are. So you wind up with quite a high. Now the tax paid in second quarter. It\u2019s about $107 million more than it was in the first. Those things tend to level themselves out over the course of the year.","Our first half operating cash flow, you could see represents 21% of revenue at $353 million and our free cash flow at $333 million is up 15% over last year. We expect outstanding cash conversion throughout remainder of the year and our total operating cash flow to revenue will be as it has been in years past continuing to grow.","In the metric you see here, $845 million of operating cash in the last 12 months and that\u2019s up from $620 million, just two years ago, so 36% improvement in operating cash flow during that two-year period.","Next slide, we look at the asset like business, again, astonishingly good numbers. Two years ago we were below 10% and people were marveling about our ability to get there. But we certainly haven\u2019t given up any of our internal strategy, so you can see we reduced inventory from 7.2% of revenue two years ago to 6% now and our payables and accruals have expanded from what they were two years ago.","You can see that the networking capital the way we define it inventory plus receivables minus payables on accrual has dropped from 9.5% to 6.2%, so that\u2019s 35% improvement in just two years.","On next slide, if we look at the balance sheet, the strong financial performance always gets best scene, when you compare your balance sheets. The year ago our cash was $375 million, today its $565 million and our undrawn revolver is virtually at -- they just very little grown against it. So it gives us a cash and undrawn revolver flexibility to invest $2 billion.","More importantly, you can see the gross debt has dropped by $513 million even after doing the $1 billion MHA acquisition last year. So we continue to pay down debt pretty quickly.","The gross debt-to-EBITDA number is below 2, 1.9, our willingness to have a debt level than that our debt tolerances is certainly much higher than the kind of number you see here and that coupled with the reality of having a couple of billion dollars to deploy.","We would expect to have pretty rapid cash deployment aggressively over the next few quarters. We would -- we think you will see some things now and some things later in the year and much larger things probably next year.","Next slide, here we look at the segment detail for each one of the business. Next slide, looking at energy systems and controls, you can see was up organically 5%. Again had strong revenue out of our compressor controls business driven by both midstream and downstream installations.","We had decent growth in our instruments and consumables business and service for refineries. And then we had much better demand certainly kind of resurgence in Canada with oilsand activity and various things that have to do with. Our pressures sensors we have and things that have to do with these line in shutoff valves and what have you.","Our book-to-bill in the second quarter, even though organic was up 5% was still at 1%. You can see total revenue was up 7%, a little bit of contribution from small acquisition we made last year. Operating profit up 8% and OP margin improved little bit to 27%.","Organic growth in the second half of the year for energy, we think to be pretty strong in the third quarter, probably a little less than that in the fourth quarter. But over the balance of the year should be fine.","We do have this sort of mid single-digit outlook for the segment for the entire year. I would be better if we saw return to large project activity that\u2019s pretty slow you can see that with everybody that\u2019s in the oil and gas side of activity. The geopolitical ambiguity that could get worse, could create project timing issues and slow decision making.","Notwithstanding that, everything else is strong, so the aftermarket products doing very well, field service is also doing well. We have an easy comp in the second half of this year, because Zetec will be back to its sort of normal type of activity, which will be substantial increase over last year\u2019s this point third quarter. And the oil and gas end markets remained pretty favorable, particularly with the oilsands getting stronger and the prices associated with Canadian products going up.","Next slide, we look here industrial technology you\u2019ll see we had continued great results out of Neptune. They grew revenue and also had better margins in the quarter. U.S. was particular strong for Neptune and Neptune was awarded an Amazon Web Services Award for what\u2019s call the City on the Cloud Invocation Challenge.","They have a program called N_SIGHT which is trademark N_SIGHT IQ which helps municipal water companies manage the flood of water data that they get, which there sort of really equip to deal with and this allows us either to host or provide software that makes it easer for them to understand the data that they have and respond the questions about from users. I believe there is a, I think, you can see YouTube video about that too.","Roper Pumps continues to have great business in the Directional Drilling Applications that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. They continue to gain share from other people. And our Material Analysis business stores at Denmark had particularly strong equipment orders and sales of their Hardness Testers which is good news on that handle of their lower margin items and it did impact their margin some as equipment grew much faster than the consumables and that\u2019s something we think will rectify itself in the second half.","I would point out Industrial Tech which had operating margins of 29.5%, which are beyond world-class and they were up 100 basis points sequentially from our first quarter operating margins.","In the second half of the year, we think we\u2019ll have little bit better organic growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Some of those businesses tend to get year end benefits.","We expect for the balance of the second half to have kind of mid single-digit revenue growth in the segment, but with very strong margins and excellent cash contribution from the segment in the second half.","Two double-digit growth type things are, our Cornell pump business is going to have very strong second half as the rental market continues to add capacity for pumping stations, we are tracking back alive and well.","And Roper Pumps\u2019 strong demand and increased capacity, means we will grow double digits there and we will have better margins as they get leverage out of that growth, certainly stronger than it was in the second half of 2013.","Next slide. Here if we look at the RF Technology businesses, everything in here is quite spectacular, although we had fairly soft booking -- book-to-bill period, the segment came in at 0.96, which is certainly not unusual. But everything else was really just amazing.","We had an absolute all-time record for TransCore in terms of revenue for the toll and traffic operations, the projects that were underway in Florida, Texas, and California, Virginia all performed very well. Actually Q2 enjoyed some pull-in from project execution effectiveness that we would have not expected until end of the third quarter, so that benefited us in the second quarter.","We had some really important wins in the area. We got San Francisco Bay area, expressly in convergence, which were extremely hard thought by everybody in the industry and we were selected, that will be over a $50 million project. We got the Massachusetts Department of Transportation back off extended that\u2019s a big contract over a decade 250 million bucks.","We\u2019ve got the Henry Hudson Bridge which is very strategic thing because New York, New Jersey tolling is the largest agency in the country and that\u2019s not an agency we have had much with.","So, again, our technology being preempted allows us to kind of get a foot in the door there which will be a -- we think forward predictor of how well we are going to do there over the next several years.","We had great tag shipments in the second quarter which benefited the revenue which you can see is up 10%, OP up 17% in the quarter. We also had some strong sales out of our RF security products for all of us who go through airports and look at the TSA agents, who probably don\u2019t know that now everyone will have little pendent so people know little bit more about what\u2019s going on there and we received the award for those pendants which will start to ship here in the second half of the year.","Our SaaS business is continued to grow so to modestly in the quarter, but they are growing. The College & University Security Projects though were little lower than last year, because we have finished North Eastern University which was a very big install, profitability was actually better for CBORD because the installation business is always carries a very modest margins but the revenue was not up a lot in the quarter for that.","In the second half of the year we will expect kind of low signal-digit growth. We\u2019ve got a couple of headwinds that are probably going to pull down our overall organic growth but we\u2019ll grow organically in the half of 2014.","Our Toll and Traffic projects are going to continue to remain at high levels, but we saw a lot of those last year, so the comps will be a little bit more difficult even though the numbers will be high.","And iTrade was able to make an acquisition that closed on July 2nd called Foodlink. This was really a technology acquisition that reminds us of United Toll Services for TransCore.","And what they do is they provide the traceability sort of a farm to fourth basis, so we are from the grower if you will to the in-store purchaser of products, which are fresh and one wants to know where they came from and how long they have been in transit and all this traceability factors are things that iTrade could acquire from others but now will have its own technology, be able to do this makes it much easier for the stores to deal with iTrade on a broader network basis. So we\u2019re encouraged by that.","Our next slide. We look at the Medical and Scientific Imaging segment. You can see it just continues to be spectacular. The organic growth in the second quarter is up 12% after being up 7% in the first quarter, suddenly led by medical. Sunquest had an all-time record quarter. There is meaningful use implementation and our ability to approve Sunquest\u2019s ability to execute really paying huge dividends now, lot of upgrades in the hospitals.","And we continue to invest very aggressively internally in Sunquest to capture more of the anatomic pathology and genomic testing opportunities that we see ahead. That\u2019s lot of internal investment in there but we\u2019re also very active in the acquisition pipeline area around those areas.","We\u2019ve had very strong performance at MHA with a lot of new members acquired for both long-term care pharmacies and long term care facilities that results in management area and facilities, that are encouraging for them.","We also had that double-digit growth at Verathon with new and enhanced products. There are several things we\u2019ve talked about and in the second half, you\u2019ll see this Titanium GlideScope which is kind of a break through product for certain applications. We\u2019ll continue to drive that growth and enhance it in the second half.","Our Northern Digital business image-guided surgical had a phenomenal quarter and based on orders and their flow of activity looks to continue that throughout the second half of the year and Scientific Imaging continue to improve up kind of mid-single digits in the quarter on a revenue basis.","In the second half of the year, we probably come in just under double-digit growth, just with imaging continues to be modest grower, where as the rest of medical we expect to have double-digit growth. New and enhanced medical products and measurement were about Verathon\u2019s titanium GlideScope being the biggest single product but there are actually quite a few others and enhancement made to our BladderScan product.","Both Sunquest and MHA will deliver double-digit growth in the second half and that certainly means more than 10%. And then I would say -- I would expect that you\u2019d see announcements from us throughout the year about possible things and that will have occurred in the acquisition pipeline area. There is a lot of very attractive small companies that we\u2019re working with and a few larger ones as well. So we\u2019re very encouraged by what\u2019s going on in the space.","Our next slide, if we look at the guidance update. Turn to next slide, we are increasing the full-year DEPS guidance from $6.22 on the low end of $6.27 and high end to $6.37. We think revenue grow should come in for the four year around the 8% to 9% and organic growth should be around 6% to 7%.","Now the organic growth when we started the year at the end of 2013, January quarter, we are established organic guidance of 4% to 7% and then as we went into the second quarter, we move the organic guidance up to 5% to 7%, as we had -- continue to see more strength. And then now we\u2019re moving it up to 6% to 7% for the full year with the 8% growth, we enjoyed in the second quarter. So the organic growth has been very strong through out the year for us.","Tax rate for the full year, we think it will be around 31%, it was 30.4%, I believe in Q2. We have some FIN 48 roll-offs that occurred in the third quarter last year that\u2019s probably going to make it difficult to have a tax rate that\u2019s as low as the 30.3%, we enjoyed last year.","So we\u2019re going in with the assumption it will be about 32% which will cost us a few pennies in the quarter. Revenue growth in the third quarter, those should be up 5% or 6%. So we established DEPS guidance here at $1.49 to $1.53 and I think our revenue in the third quarter will be somewhat similar, little bit above hopefully in Q3 which is sort of a typical very new pattern for us but certainly up nicely from the third quarter of last year.","Our next slide. If we look at the summary for the second quarter, it was just an extraordinarily great quarter for us. In addition to having all these nominal numbers of records with orders and revenue and backlog and net earnings and EBITDA, the variables were really good with the revenue up 10%, gross margin up 120 to 59.1%, operating margins up 180 bps to 27.9%. The leverage was just phenomenal in the quarter. For those of you who are without your calculator, you\u2019ll see our operating leverage was about 46% in the second quarter which is why getting any nominal growth is so powerful here at Roper.","Our EBITDA was up 14% to $295 million and we\u2019ve raised our full year guidance and we had just an excellent first half performance with these record margins of organic growth. We think our full year cash conversion will again be outstanding like it was last year. And our current acquisitions discussions remain mostly in the medical and software, they are very active with lots of opportunity and have very powerful balance sheet to take advantage of them.","So with that, John, I think we\u2019re positioned for both a record year and questions from the investment community.","John Humphrey","Okay, Tina, can you go and start the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","Good morning. Couple of questions, first, Brian, can you talk about the sustainability you see in the growth you\u2019re experiencing in Sunquest and MHA just looking out over the next couple of years? And also sort of fold into that, what you think is going on with market share. And I obviously recognize there is a larger recurring revenue component here. So I just want to get a feel for what you think these normalize out?","Brian Jellison","Well, we\u2019re going to expect double-digit growth for some time out of Sunquest that areas that we\u2019re taking them into are very exciting areas. There is a lot of opportunity in the short run. You get the benefit from meaningful use requirements to take care of government regulation and in the long run, you get many new forms of testing with us having just a very unique way to capture that. So we\u2019re very positive about the long-term prospects for Sunquest, whether it turns out to be a high single-digit grower over the next five years or modest double-digit grower or substantially more, it\u2019s hard to say.","It generates lot of cash. It gives us a lot of money to add from acquisition view point and certainly when I think about what we\u2019ll do organically there, plus the acquisitions we\u2019re going to make in that space, it will be one of those, if not the most exciting business we have along with MHA.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","And just as a follow-up, you\u2019ve definitely seen more incrementally upbeats on you M&A prospects looking out over the next couple of quarters. Can you talk about on the relative size of the assets you\u2019re looking to acquire the multiples and that you might -- would be willing to pay here knowing this is a tough environment?","Brian Jellison","Well, we could but it wouldn\u2019t be our interest to what sellers know what we might be willing to pay for anything about. So -- Matt, it\u2019s hard to say but we said generally we like to not pay over 10 or 11 times first year EBITDA, that\u2019s something that\u2019s absolutely true.","Yeah, sometimes, you maybe a little higher and sometimes you maybe lower but if you look at a blended basis, we think we need to be investing at a clip that\u2019s $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year and sometimes we\u2019re ahead of that, behind it and there will be different price values based on the kind of cash flows that we can see from businesses. But over time, we still kind of think of modeling our acquisition growth with debt-to-EBITDA, somewhere around 3 or less, could be higher from time to time and looking to have a blended acquisition first year number around 11 but it could be higher.","And we\u2019re trailing -- selling in a trailing 15 times enterprise value multiple and the people that are like us in market place, many of them are 20 to 25 times. So these are very high value to assets. But I would have to say that we\u2019re not seeing difficulty again in what we think it will be our ability to close transactions in the next several months, having to do with pricing. I think pricings are high but rationale.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","Great. That\u2019s all I need. Thanks Brian.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","While we\u2019re on the topic of M&A, just if you would clarify one point here Brian because definitely you\u2019re standing little bit more positive in your ability to close deals. So what\u2019s changed in past quarter in terms of your being more optimistic here? It didn\u2019t sound like pricing has changed but is it the availability of assets and more active discussions but certainly you can see something has changed?","Brian Jellison","I\u2019d like to say that we like to mix the things that we\u2019re involved with and we feel like we\u2019re making a lot of progress and talking to people we haven\u2019t decided whether they\u2019re ready to engage or not. So that all feels pretty good. Usually, when we get -- as we get further and further down the line, there is a lot of people that have an orientation. They wanted to get something done before the end of the year. So it\u2019s getting closer than the end of the year and there is a kind of seasonality that probably shouldn\u2019t be there that is.","And the things that we\u2019re involved with now that we really like, more diligence we do the better, we feel about them. And so those are all encouraging. And there is just a lot to say, I think that you\u2019ve got unbelievably powerful management teams in some of these arenas. In medical arena, and some of the software arena, so we have that really give us an ability to make bolt-on things for these guys that frankly we didn\u2019t have before we have these two big legs in-house.","And so when you get back to being able to pick up some really great businesses that not each one is a $1.5 billion that we have to drive, it increases your confidence about being able to execute and deploy cash. We need to deploy cash in the next year. We\u2019re not interested in sitting on a balance sheet with gross debt-to-EBITDA at 1.9 or net debt at 1.5. That\u2019s in our view not acceptable.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And could you clarify on the RF business, you mentioned there were some poll-ins related to project effectiveness. Just kind of flash out that point, what were the businesses and can you quantify that portion that was build in?","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s pretty much all the TransCore project businesses which John, if you want to give Dean.","John Humphrey","Yeah. So we have a number of projects there underway in Virginia as well as in Florida. I don\u2019t really think of them as poll-ins. It\u2019s just that the revenue was recognized in the second quarter. We probably would have expected a little bit at the end of the third quarter. It wasn\u2019t anything we tried to do but just because of the effectiveness of completing and getting milestones on those projects with a little more revenue to what we would have expected for the second quarter.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Would that be reflected in lower third quarter or the TransCore business or would we not see that blip?","John Humphrey","No, there is probably not as much growth as what we would have thought three months ago. So we had a little more in second quarter, may be a little less than the third quarter but still for the year, we can -- we continue to see our total traffic business performing extremely well with a very nice growth.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning.","Brian Jellison","Hi. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Just on the guidance, when you tweaked up the organic growth rate for the year up to the high end and you barely budge the EPS number with your conversion rates being extremely strong at 50% or so. I would have expected maybe at least a nickel or dime with the additional revenue. I don\u2019t think there is a change in tax rate. There is something on mix and margin, that\u2019s going to change here in the second half?","Brian Jellison","I wouldn\u2019t say so. I mean, what it is, is that our range of particular outcomes on the organic roadside, and we just continue to move towards the higher end of that range because the performance that we\u2019ve been able to post in both the first and the second quarter. So we\u2019ve been mostly done in the second quarter that won\u2019t we expected, but the second half still looks very consistent with kind of what we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. So we wouldn\u2019t read too much into that.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. And then I guess just on the same kind of lot of question here third quarter, I mean I think it\u2019s been a while since your earnings were -- didn\u2019t grow nicely from the second to third quarter, just kind of from season perspective yet. You\u2019re kind of guiding something, that\u2019s more flattish to even maybe down a little bit again. Is there something -- is there a specific couple of businesses? Or on the margin front but that we should be looking at to justify that?","Brian Jellison","Our test business is expected to be higher, so our taxes are expected to be higher in the third quarter than the one\u2026","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. Okay. So it\u2019s just the tax dynamic, I think sales as well though. I mean, your sales are guided to be flat as well, flattish.","John Humphrey","I think on a sequential basis, sales will be a little higher than they were in the second quarter, but not dramatically higher in the second quarter. And part of that is, what we\u2019re saying where you\u2019ve got some revenue recognition in the second quarter around the TransCore project so that it does in fact taken away from the third quarter when that would be there. So we look at two quarters together, our guidance is kind of about where it would have been for, although just we raised the bottom in quite a bit because it\u2019s already in the back.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. Okay. That makes sense. And just one last quick on the acquisition front, I would say this is kind of the material change in what you\u2019re saying versus what you\u2019re saying several months ago when you really were talking about the pricing environment being very tough. And then you talked about the size of the deals, some smaller ones closing near term, larger ones next year. Why -- is it just takes a longer, the large ones longer to get done, or is that just something about how the way the M&A environment kind of unfold in cycles, where the smaller ones go first and then the larger ones? I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just kind of curious as to why the difference in comments around the size of the deals.","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t think that there is any seasonality related to the size. There is a desire for lot of people if there is a market with asset they want to get it done generally before the end of the year for lots of reasons. So there is an opportunity to close more towards the end of the year. If you look at our history over time, you see a lot of the things that happen in the last quarter of the year.","In terms of the size of deals, I mean, most of the things that we\u2019ve been looking at this year are relatively large, but we have so many more smaller things that we can tucked in to an MHA and to a Sunquest that we\u2019ve been willing to look at those things, which frankly we would have not paid a lot of energy to that, because we would have thought that we didn\u2019t need another $100 million business here and another $80 million business here unless we had a leadership team that can assimilate those in a very good way.","So we are encouraged by that and we\u2019ve added an awful lot of strength to those two businesses in terms of people and leadership and capability. So that probably is as much of reason why I sound the way I do about that because of our confidence in the leadership in those companies. And then at the beginning of the year there were -- there certainly were large deals that we were interested in that we thought we\u2019re going at high-teens multiples from an adjusted EBITDA basis that our diligence wasn\u2019t willing to buy into the adjustments.","So I think there is a little bit more clarity on the part of people about what they think they are going to do for the balance of this year and what they are going to do for the balance of next year, and diligence process is coming in with the more realistic outcome than guys trying to tell you this trees are going to the moon and they are not. They are a little more realistic. And we said for long time that things like junk bonds and CCC debt and subordinated. This crazy, crazy, crazy risk factors relative to where they trade on the pricing and start to see some erosion in that finally. So that changes attitudes instantly.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Brian Jellison","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So the first question I guess just talking about M&A, it does sound pretty encouraging how optimistic you are about getting the deals done. I guess, is there way you can quantify over the next 12 months how much you can get done? And clearly your balance sheet is in great shape. It seems like the pipeline is strong. And the follow-on beyond that is the focus has really been on the medical and scientific imaging, is that squarely where you are looking at today? Or are there areas across the rest of your portfolio where you are looking at due diligence as well?","Brian Jellison","Well, we look at a lot of different areas, but the reality is that the economic performance and cash on cash returns in medical and software just blow away the stuff that is generally available in energy or in any kind of core industrial business. So we\u2019ve enjoyed great growth in our pump businesses, record level growth, but they take a lot of assets. So they don\u2019t provide same level of cash on cash return that our software businesses do or that our medical businesses do.","So we look at a lot of stuff, but the stuff that tends to get through the filter, we -- our overall company has a cash return on it, gross investment of over 100%. If you look at probably the single best multi industry guide that companies in the 40s, so we see a lot of incoming stuff, but generally if they are going to have cash returns in the 20s, they are not going to join our family. So it\u2019s just the dynamic of the economic performance of the businesses that keeps us so active in the medical and software.","And if you look at the next several quarters, over the next two years we view what expect we would -- we set for long time, we deploy $5 billion over the next four or five years, we would expect to deploy at least $1 billion to $1.5 billion every year, but it\u2019s always lumpy about when that will happen. So I think that there are few things that we will probably do relatively quickly, and then there will be other things that we will reach in over time whether that happens in the next six months or the next 12 months is impossible to predict. And whether you do something for $100 million or you do something for a $1 billion on the timeline at which comes next is also impossible to predict because we will have offers to acquire things in which we are doing diligence, some which will be at a $100 million and others will be at a $1 billion. So we\u2019re never in control of that dynamic.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful color, Brian. And my follow-on question is around the drop to margins, clearly the incrementals were really strong this quarter at 46%. I think last quarter we were talking about an incremental range of 35%, 40%. So my question was, was there anything specific about the quarter that helped use the margin this quarter and how should we then think about your incremental margins moving forward. Is 35%, 40% the appropriate way to think about it or your business is really just kind of operating on all cylinders and maybe a higher range is appropriate at this time?","Brian Jellison","No, I think we think 35%, 40% is appropriate guidance for people over time. We\u2019re always going to have mix variance second quarter on our company. It gets a lot of renewals in the software business, gets a lot of things happen in Q2. Q3 is really not as active Q4, then it gets to be really big, because all kinds of year end MRO and investments occur in the first quarter. I think our leverage was something like 37% and that was outstanding. This was extraordinary. And if it happens again, we will take it.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","And just one follow-on question I guess on the margins for industrial tech. This is a margin that you call about a few things in the quarter. The operating margins have been down now for I think six quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis and things that it sounds like they are getting better at Cornell pump. Should we start to see margin expansion in this business moving forward?","Brian Jellison","I always react to that because I believe that the operating margins in the business are pretty close to the gross margin of everybody that they compete with. So thinking about the 29.5% operating margins in that business and wondering if they could get better, seems to me to be unrealistic, but we could deliver, you never know. These are the best industrial businesses known to anyone, I\u2019m aware of. If you got anybody that\u2019s got margins that look like these, please send us.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And our next question from Chris Glynn, Oppenheimer.","John Humphrey","Hello.","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","A very nice year-over-year expansion. Just wondering how to think about the dynamic there of mix versus core incremental margins? Clearly volume helped, but we talked about mix a lot with this business in the past.","John Humphrey","I\u2019m sorry Chris. The first part of your question we didn\u2019t catch, so which particular segment are you referring to?","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Yeah. John, this is RF and historically as the margins have moved, mix has been a big part of the discussion. So I\u2019m just wondering if there is a way to think about core volume leverage since you did have good volumes and the margins were up nicely.","John Humphrey","Yeah. They\u2019re really not a good way to think about that because of the vast difference in the underlying margin structure across this segment. The software business is the incrementals, they are coming much higher, particularly for their software renewals and the expansion. Their software, if it\u2019s installations, it\u2019s lower, of course, on the toll and traffic side, you also have the similar dynamic in terms of whether it\u2019s tags and readers, which because of the technology and the investment, they make they carry higher gross margins versus the service and ongoing work.","So I would love to give you the rule of thumb, but I just don\u2019t have one, so based upon the relative contribution of our toll and traffic project business versus the technology that delivered through hardware or software.","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Right. Yeah. Just struck me with toll and traffic leading to growth and then near record margins, but understood there is mix within that as well.","John Humphrey","And if I just follow up on that, it was especially strong in terms of the delivery of hardware and tags, our Amtech business, which is part of toll and traffic just had a phenomenal quarter, particularly with the continuing tag upgrade project in Florida.","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then we got some good color on the long run expectations for MHA and Sunquest. Verathon has got some things going on. Was wondering if we could get a similar commentary on Verathon Northern digital type businesses?","John Humphrey","So hope those have very good tailwind but for different reasons. So in terms of Northern Digital and the technology that they enable for image-guided surgery, so they have just a preeminent position inside image-guided surgery for what they are able to accomplish and that\u2019s just the continuing growth in that market and because of their dominant share, they continue to benefit from that.","Verathon on the other hand is really more of introduction of new and enhanced products when going through what is just a world class sales organization. And so therefore for different reasons, we expect both of those businesses to continue to have high-single-digit growth going forward for quite a long time I think.","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","John Humphrey","Hey, good morning.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Good morning. Two questions, Brian, we heard you complain about your tax rate through years actually and here is the discussion about M&A and the focus on healthcare and probably one of my question is going. I mean, is there a way to do something a little bit more creative with the corporate structure, the tax structure of the company?","Brian Jellison","The answer could be that there a lot of different things. As the topic (indiscernible) specifically today with a few other people, of course, are more and more inversions with the portion of the company or something. We\u2019ve had a bright path to the door from people try to tell us about this, that and the other. Usually, they\u2019re talking of businesses that are really pathetic and so the concept of doing something purely for taxes is not something we\u2019re going to do.","It needs to be a solid business. It is hard for people to find businesses like ours. It\u2019s pretty unique to find a molding industry player, that\u2019s got 59% gross margins and 33% EBITDA margins and has more than 20% cash to sales and find a partner with it. So we were still blessed with massive cash performance. And so as interest cost goes up for other people that are doing acquisitions, prices come down and we\u2019re the biggest beneficiary that\u2019s because we self fund most of everything we do and if we went out far in a billion or two and at the moment it is pretty modest.","So we\u2019re in a very, very good position, probably the best we\u2019ve ever been in to do transactions. And if something came along that was a partial inversion with one of the businesses we wouldn\u2019t necessarily rejected, but putting one of our great businesses with something that\u2019s not very exciting because you might be able to save some tax in an environment that\u2019s pretty ambiguous, is not a good strategy in our view.","What we\u2019ve said and we always say is there are to be a much better concept around corporate tax rates. And we\u2019re having to pay a tax rate like ours when we compete in the global market is tough, but a lot of our businesses, even though 40% of the revenue is not in the United States. A lot of the best performing cash generated businesses are in the U.S. and it\u2019s a little harder to do something with that and meet the inversion requirements that the government has. Let alone the risk of retroactivity from the March number that you\u2019re seeing politicians trying to bring there.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Right. And then as follow-up actually on cash flow, so you have the cash tax noise in the quarter, we know it\u2019s year-to-date, I mean, your cash taxes may have been $30 million or so, about what kind of went through on a GAAP P&L. So not a huge GAAP there. With the structural amortization benefit you have, I would have thought cash would have been a little bit better year-to-date. Is there anything else going on working capital and the comment about closing the year strong, should we expect something kind of in the 130% kind of zip code for the cash conversion rate for the year?","Brian Jellison","Yeah. I think the least that could -- we were expected to probably do a little bit better than 130%.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Yeah. Good morning.","John Humphrey","Hey, good morning, Alex.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Puts you on a new\u2026.","John Humphrey","Hello.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Hello, hello.","John Humphrey","Hello.","Operator","Mr. Blanton, please go ahead.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Hello, I got cut out. Hello.","John Humphrey","You\u2019re still -- Alex you\u2019re still on. We can hear okay.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay. I didn\u2019t know whether I was on it, sorry. I want to go into a little more along the line that someone was talking about the decline in earnings from second quarter. As to the reasons, I see the tax rate was 30.4% in the second quarter and that increased to 32%, it will cost you $0.04, but you\u2019ve mentioned headwinds in TransCore and I don\u2019t think, I heard anything more about that. And also are there any acquisition expenses connected with FoodLink?","John Humphrey","So, any acquisition expenses that we have, were recorded in the second quarter, since we did close on that transaction on July 2. So I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s material but we do expect to have some acquisition expenses in the third quarter, not related to FoodLink. On the other hand you did obviously pickup on the tax rate increase in Q2 to Q3 and we just had a very strong conversion as Brian mentioned for the second quarter. Some of the software renewal did happen during that timeframe, carry along with them very high margins. So we continue to see the second half, somewhere in 35% to 40% leverage on incremental growth and then so it\u2019s very similar to what we have in the first half.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","And what were the headwinds in TransCore that Brian referred to when he was talking about that segment but didn\u2019t go into any detail on it?","John Humphrey","So really headwinds as much is timing associated with the milestones on a project. So as we mentioned, we had very strong performance for executing on those projects in Virginia and Texas and in Florida and other places and that comes along with some revenue recognitions, profit recognitions in the second quarter. That looks a little bit better than what we would have expected for the third quarter.","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay. Thank you.","John Humphrey","","You\u2019re welcome Alex.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to John Humphrey for closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Tina and thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking to you at the end of our third quarter.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"19066":["Roper Technologies, Inc.

Baird & Co.","Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company","Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the Roper Technologies First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you, Abby, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. ","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. ","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and is further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. ","For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pretax basis, a $74 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and a $2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisition. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. ","And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thanks, Zack. Good morning, everybody. We'll go through the first quarter, look at the segment detail, talk about the rest of the year and then take your questions. So next slide. We had a record quarter of virtually every kind of metric you can think about. Revenue was up 9% to $1.2 billion and organic growth was up 6%. It was broad-based across all the segments, they all grew mid-single digits or greater. ","Gross margin was up, again, 30 basis points to 62.5%. We'll talk a little bit about that later because in an environment where people are starting to worry about cost push, inflation or price cost issues, it's sometimes forgotten that the 62.5% means something really important, that our cost of goods sold is only 37.5%. ","And in an environment where people worry about material, if you only got a cost of goods sold ratio of 37%, it looks a lot better than those guys that have gross margins of 38%, meaning cost of goods sold of 62%. ","Earnings before taxes were up 10% to $332 million. We put that in as a distinct reference so you can see what was unrelated to the Tax Act versus what's related to Tax Act. So the 10% up is earnings before tax. The DEPS earnings, which includes the sort of trifecta around the Tax Act for us, were up 24% to $2.61. ","The operating cash flow was $282 million, which is 23% of revenue. We'll talk a little bit about that number. It's terrific at 23% of revenue, a little lower than last year for a specific reason. We reduced the debt by $535 million in the quarter, and since the end of 2016, we've taken $1.6 billion off of our gross debt number. So it was really a great quarter and really throughout the enterprise, we had very good execution. ","Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you'll see revenue went up from $1.1 billion to $1.205 billion. Gross margins from 62.2% to 62.5%. The tax rate down at the bottom, you can see was 28.2% last year, this year, it was 18.1%. I think we guided people sort of high teens. The rest of the year, we think, it'll be about 23%. Q1 is a little lower because of some unique benefits that happened in the first quarter on a tax perspective. And there, you can see that the adjusted DEPS number was up $0.50 from $2.11 to $2.61. ","Next slide. We look, again, at the progress we continue to make on deferred revenue on our asset-light business model. If we just look at the last two years, two years ago at the end of the first quarter, we had 4.8% net working capital to revenue. This quarter, we closed out at a negative number of 2.7%. You can start to see a trend now because on this slide, if you look at the column 3\/31\/17, that was a negative 2.9%. And that was the first time that we had gone to negative working capital. And now this time at 2.7% is the fifth consecutive quarter where we've been at negative working capital. And that's run from a negative 2.9% to 2.4% to negative 2.5% and negative 3.3% and now, negative 2.7%. So starting to get a real-world, new normal for Roper. ","Five years ago, when you look at the same data, inventory this quarter was at 4.5% of revenue and five years ago, it was 6.8%. Receivables, we're at 16.4%. five years ago, they were 19.3%. Payables and accruals were exactly the same, 11.5% this year and 11.5%, five years ago. But deferred revenue, close to doubled from five years ago, it was 6.5%, five years ago of revenue, now, it's 12.1%. ","When you total it up five years ago, we were 8.2%, net working capital to revenue, and now, we're negative 2.7%. So when you basically make an 11% swathe on sales of approaching $5 billion, it's a big, big, big change. ","Deferred revenue, you can see totaled $585 million at the end of the first quarter, which is more than double what it was just two years ago. So as we continue to grow, we find that the working capital becomes a source of funds for us. ","Next slide. We continue to compound cash flow and are in a particularly good place to achieve another all-time record in 2018 for cash flow performance. ","In the first quarter, we had two things that were unusual. There was timing of a tax payment in 2018 that totaled about $43 million, and then we had, in the first quarter of last year, a big MTA payment for that project. It was around $34 million and another one in the Middle East for about $16 million. So there was $93 million of an unusual variance between the first quarter of this year and last year, and that will smooth out as the year goes on, and we'll still deliver a very high operating cash flow to revenue and free cash flow as well. You can see the conversion number here with the GAAP to net earnings conversion at 141%. ","Next slide. The sort of strong financial position, you can see the debt structure here. Cash is at $366 million. We were able to repatriate about $300 million of non-U.S. cash in the first quarter, still a couple hundred million left that we think we'll be able to repatriate during the course of the year. ","Our undrawn revolver, we have $2.5 billion revolver, and there's nearly $1.8 billion in that revolver that remains undrawn. So our capacity for investing in capital deployment is very high. Our gross debt has dropped down $1.2 billion just in the last year and the net debt number also down substantially. If you look at our trailing EBITDA for that period of time, we're up $261 million. So you're up on EBITDA, down on debt and that gives you the net debt-to-EBITDA number here of 2.6x versus 3.7x a year ago. And you're picking up more than sort of 20 basis points on that thing every time. ","So the way we build cash here, it takes no time at all for us to be below 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. But we're likely to find ways to deploy capital here in 2018, could happen sooner than later. We're in a number of transactions now, all of which are attractive, but you never know if you're going to get any of them done. ","Next slide. Here we look at the segment detail, and all of these things are really wonderful businesses. But if we turn this next slide, here to Slide 11, you'll see our trailing 12-month margins, the gross margins on the top and the EBITDA margins on the blue line at the bottom are really spectacular for all of our segments. ","So you look at energy at 57%, gross margin and 31% EBITDA margin. Part of what I want to point out is that the enterprise in total is running about 62.5% gross margin, so it's very much like the RF & Software line. And if you've got 37% cost of goods sold, which would be the reciprocal of that gross margin, and half of your cost of goods sold is material, and it goes up by 10%, if you can raise your prices by 1.9%, you have no cost risk at all. And if the material is only 1\/3, which is more like what it is with us, and prices go up on material by 10%, you wipe that out with a 1.5% price increase. ","So we are not seeing, do not expect to ever see this cost push in price and pressure that other people are complaining about, talking about the material cost. And part of that is that our cost of goods sold, it's quite modest compared to the other multi-industry guys. Our businesses are really in outstanding niches. They're nimbly led. And I can assure you, we were on top of any of these kind of issues related to tariffs or material price or anything else. ","Next slide. We carried our biggest segment here, the RF Technology & Software group. It did almost $0.5 billion in the quarter. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit was up 13% and the OP margin was up 130 basis points, which was particularly satisfying because of a lot of the amortization that gets into that OP margin. Organic for the segment was up 4% with FX having a favorable impact just 1% here. ","We had low single-digit growth in toll and traffic, which we weren't necessarily expecting. Very good execution, so we're finding good margins and not having negative variances. A lot of stuff is out for quote, but it's feedback on timing is just very unclear. Deltek Software business continues to do really well, both the GovCon and the professional service markets are doing exceptionally well. The bolt-ons we did for them [indiscernible] are performing as we expected they would and we're getting the synergies that Deltek had expected to get. ","On ConstructConnect, I'm going to ask Neil to tell you a little bit about these two small bolt-on acquisitions we did to expand our preconstruction takeoff and estimation software. These help us expand the size of our network, one is called QuoteSoft and the other is PlanSwift. In total, we invested about $39 million. So, Neil, you might just explain how those make ConstructConnect's network stronger.","Laurence Hunn","Right. Both QuoteSoft and PlanSwift are in the preconstruction planning space and focus on automating the takeoffs and estimation activities of contractors. Both enhance the ConstructConnect network and product platform, where it's more comprehensive in ConstructConnect's pursuit to be embedded in the daily workflows of contractors relative to their preconstruction activities. QuoteSoft focuses on the HVAC and plumbing trades. PlanSwift focuses on other trades such as flooring, drywall, windows, et cetera. Thank you, Brian.","Brian Jellison","Okay. Aderant also had spectacular quarter. They were up double digits with significant gains with large law firms. So we continue to feel good about Aderant, but they certainly are outperforming this year. On our Freight Matching business, that growth has really been driven by a combination of solid markets, but substantial improvement in retention and net subscriber adds here. We just launched another app on expanding the ability to track loads, which we think will drive additional growth in the second half of the year. ","And then lastly, our RF IDeas unit in Chicago is doing exceptionally well with the privacy concerns. Their technology really allows identification of individual people in a wide variety of access areas, around access control and access to storerooms and supplies. So that business is really terrific. For the rest of the year in terms of Q2 to Q4, we think we'll have about mid-single-digit growth in the software businesses with their outsized margins and cash performance. The toll and traffic is harder to predict. We think we'll get modest growth there, but it actually could be outsized, but it's just, it's hard to predict. In total, we think the segment will grow around 4% to 5% and continue to have the terrific margins that we see here. ","Next slide. If you look at Medical & Scientific Imaging, $366 million in revenue, it was up 5%. Did a little bit better on the revenue side than we expected, and we had some particularly good breakthrough situations. We've had an accelerating rate of adoption at Strata with the financial decision support cloud software we have. ","And importantly, Kaiser, which is one of the largest entities in the country, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the national cost accounting program technology that's supported here by Strata. To get the idea of the size of that, Kaiser's got 12 million members. They have 22,000 doctors and 39 hospitals. So for Strata, this is the sort of perfect validation of how good our technology leadership is compared to everybody. And we expect both adoption to continue at an increasing rate, and we think we'll gain share from other people with older systems. ","And the second area I want to highlight here is given the fact that we had 4% organic growth, we had a decline in revenue in the high margin U.S. lab business, but fortunately, it was really offset by growth in revenue in our data innovations diagnostic connectivity business and CliniSys, our international lab business. ","So the good news around that is that it really thwarted the decline in revenue, but it can't make up for the operating margin. So where you see the 150 basis points deterioration of OP margins going to 32.9%, that's still that pressure we're going to have this year and next on the U.S. lab business. ","We had high single-digit growth in the software solutions for both long term care and home health, with our software acquisitions that we made a couple years ago called SoftWriters and SHP. The medical product businesses in total came in at mid-single-digit growth, and we see that sort of continuing throughout the year. And then Gatan continues to build its backlog where some new products that were launched last year and will continue to have expanded growth over the next several years. So we actually commenced shipping the next generation of these cryo-EM projects right at the end of the quarter. ","As we look for the balance of the year, in Q2 through Q4 for expectations, we think we'll have broad-based growth across the medical businesses as a group. Scientific imaging should continue to improve over the prior year, and we think we'll get mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment in total, but will still be down maybe about 100 basis points on margin due to the U.S. lab business with its higher margins declining as a part of the mix of the segment. ","Next slide. On Industrial Technology and Energy were pretty spectacular. They had double-digit growth for both segments. You can see Industrial was up 18%, Energy was up 11%. On Industrial, the organic was up 15%. We had double-digit growth at Neptune, and we had all-time record orders for Neptune as they continue to benefit from real customer-focused innovation. I think one of the things that's really showing up in the last 1.5 years at Neptune is the software experience we've had in our other businesses, we've been able to sort of virtually add to Neptune's capability in that arena and help guide them in terms of all the development things that they're doing, which are quite exciting as they build new technologies in Atlanta and have the plant focusing on what it does best, its boundary. ","We're backward-compatible at Neptune in almost everything we do. And as a technology company, you find Neptune acting and behaving like an emerging technology company now as opposed to somebody that's making a lot of years, and that's very exciting for all of us. ","The Cornell Pump had an all-time record. I mean, they're -- they have gained share at the expense of other pump companies at an extraordinary rate. They'll have a record year. The first quarter was just beyond spectacular and to Robert and all the team out there, we just thank you for your outstanding performance. ","We had really good end markets in our Roper Pump business where their execution and our technology products are sort of taking off again with the DuraTorque technology. We've got better solutions with rubber and bearing wear and drilling faster and deeper than many other people do, and so they're back. They're not back to the all-time levels that they enjoyed a few years ago, but they're certainly up quite substantially. ","And for the remainder of the year, we think we'll get sort of high single digit growth organically with great leverage. Leverage in these segments are pretty strong if you can see revenue up 18% and operating profit up 23%. ","In the Energy segment, we had 5% organic growth. We had strength in upstream applications, which were sort of similar to Roper Pump. Our AMOT businesses were up very, very dramatically. Most importantly, our compressor control business did better than we expected, sort of flat to the prior year. We expected it would be down some, and we're starting to see green shoots for compressor controls for 2019 projects that we wouldn't have expected this early. And so that's encouraging for the longer term for that business. ","The industrial businesses pretty much universally that are inside the Energy segment all performed reasonably well. For the rest of the year, we think we'll have sort of 5% to 7% organic growth with good leverage throughout. And with that, I think we can turn to our guidance update. ","Next slide here, Slide 16, you can see that we're raising our full year guidance from $11.08 on the low end -- or I'm sorry, from $10.88 on the low end to $11.08. And on the high end, from $11.20 up to $11.32. Organic growth, we've raised by a point, 4% to 6%, up from 4% to 5%. All of the end market data we see supports that. ","Our tax rate is going to be sort of 23% for the second quarter, the third and the fourth. We don't think there'll be much variation between those quarters, and it's up from the lowest quarter of 18% in the first quarter. Q2 guidance, we're laying in at $2.65 on the low end and $2.71 at the high end. All of these point to operating cash flow that should continue to be a record in 2018. ","Next slide. If we look at Q1 on the summary, sort of two main themes that we take away from the quarter is that our asset-light, niche market strategy continues to deliver just spectacular results. And a lot of that comes from nimble execution from our business. We had broad-based revenue growth as we've said with organic at plus 6%. The end market data we see is encouraging. We probably haven't seen any more optimism as a group as we went through our Q1 reports and talked about forecasts for the balance of the year. I think there's a mature level of optimism as opposed to euphoria. ","I think people feel really good about not being impacted by any of these geopolitical issues or tariff issues or cost push inflation on material because our cost of goods sold is so low in material and so much less a component of our cost structure. ","Our gross margins were up, which sort of proves the point that we're staying ahead on that price cost challenge. ","Earnings before taxes up 10% and with the trifecta of tax reform giving us a lower rate, allowing us to repatriate cash and then getting more value out of the cash that we were providing before because we get to keep more of it, we were up as you can see 24%. ","And then on the other side is our capital deployment side, which the balance sheet really has put back into a great place for us. We reduced debt by $1.6 billion since the end of '16. The still pace would be about $7 billion of acquisitions over the next four years including this one. We're seeing a lot more attractive opportunities in the pipeline already, and we're engaged in several, all of which look attractive at this point. ","So we had a great first quarter. We got a positive outlook for '18, and we've raised the guidance. ","And with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Just a couple things, Brian. The core growth outlook for '18 kind of bumped up by this -- by a point-or-so. And when I kind of sift through the commentary on the platforms, is it safe to assume that the industrial tech platform has a bit more momentum maybe than planned earlier in the year? Is that primarily where the core growth outlook has bumped up?","Brian Jellison","I wouldn't say that. It was a little stronger in the first quarter than we expected because some of the businesses are industrial. Certainly, Neptune was spectacular, belies to everything everybody else says about these spaces. Felt better about that. There isn't anything that's soft, so we're talking about the rest of the year at high single digits, not at 15%. But yes, I think that's good. Actually, maybe more encouraged by medical in some respects because two good things happened. You -- the level of reduction in the U.S. lab business was what we expected. It wasn't higher than we expected, It was manageable, and we offset it with growth in other portions of our overall lab business. So that was encouraging. It gives us a little better feeling for the year. And I think just the general attitude of everybody when you challenge them about their forecast, the way we run the company, we don't use budgets, but we don't tell people, we use finances. Drill down exactly in Q1 what you were this quarter versus one year ago and why that's going to sequentially change and what's going to happen. The answers to all those questions around where the orders are coming from, where the growth was coming from were all very mature and very well thought out reasons, hence, builds a little confidence for us and so we've raised the organic growth by one point.","Robert Crisci","Yes, it really was, Rick, broad-based. And the first quarter really look at each of the four segments, really outperformed our internal model, and that confidence then continues throughout the year as we go through our review process and talk to all the leaders.","Richard Eastman","Sure. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, when you look at the M&A pipeline, Brian, you referenced it's essentially full and there are some nice opportunities in there. Is it more target-rich in the application software area, which would fall into RF? Or is there some medical software in there? I presume it's software-dominated, but maybe you could just provide a little bit of color, maybe next layer down on what that pipeline looks like.","Brian Jellison","I think most of the things are application software network kind of things, so less likely to be medical. At the moment, the things that we're doing are not medical, but it doesn't mean there wouldn't be one. I mean, we're actually just starting to look at one, it's a smaller thing in medical. But there are a lot of application software things and there's some things that we've looked at in the past that we gave people advice about what they ought to do to make it a better company, and some of those people have taken that advice, and we're going to maybe look at them again to see how we feel about that.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. ","Okay, we will go to our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Reive","This is Jeff on for Deane. My first question is just on your toll and traffic business. Can you maybe just talk about the bid pipeline that you're seeing and maybe more broadly the penetration of cashless tolls?","Brian Jellison","I think the bid pipeline is extremely full. I think there are some people waiting around to see if there's going to be any support from an infrastructure program that the government throws out that would pay for stuff that they otherwise have to pay for themselves. We really have always driven the cashless tolling because we have the supreme technology about the ability to read various things. So we have a family of multi-protocol readers that can read a wide variety of technology. So those things really facilitate people doing adoption. So you watch the people drive through at high rates of speed and then we really have great execution capability for remotely accessing those technologies and helping people manage it. All of that is good. And then lastly, in addition to the technology where we're really preeminent, there's also just the administrative back office activity and there's a lot of bidding around that as some of the very long in the tooth administrative people that have been around for a very long time and who've not improved very much. A lot of people are looking for new players. And so when they look out for somebody that has a proven track record and has expanded rather than not expanded the technology, we kind of get the first look. So we're involved in a lot of those things as well.","Jeffrey Reive","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, do you have an update on the timing of the resegmentation of your portfolio and the initiative to streamline the internal P&Ls?","Brian Jellison","The situation around that sort of it's, what are we acquiring this year? Are we going to divest anything? Is that going to have an effect on anything? Neil spent a good deal of time in the quarter beginning to look at that, and he's spending a great deal of time the second quarter traveling around and visiting with people. So I think that will continue to progress throughout the year.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Lee Sanquist [ph] on for Julian. In medical, you touched on the mixed headwinds from U.S. labs, but not the start up costs in Australia. Can you just update us on the cost to ramp up for the Queensland project?","Laurence Hunn","Yes, it's Neil. So the project has started. It started on track. It'll be one where the timing of revenue relative to the timing of the expenses will be a little imbalanced or out of balance this year and then it corrects itself for the remaining nine years of the contract. And so it's on plan in terms of our expectations and we would continue to expect the project to progress in that order.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. On the balance sheet, the delevering effort has been very impressive. Can you just provide a perspective, updated perspective on the capital deployment priorities if, in the off chance, M&A does not materialize?","Brian Jellison","I don't think there's any chance that [indiscernible] M&A does not materialize. So that's the perspective. Believe me, in a slow year, we'd look at $10 billion of opportunity, make offers. There is no way that we're not going to be having the ability to do fantastic transactions in M&A.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.","Joseph Giordano","Curious, like you mentioned the Aderant growth, and how early or late are you into that whole customer base being up for grabs and having to make decisions there?","Laurence Hunn","Yes. I think it calls for a mid, if you will. I mean, there's -- the competitor has a forced migration coming in 3.5 or 4 years, and so customers are in the process of getting ahead of that. And so we've got several years to go. I think it's worth also noting that Aderant is not sitting around waiting for that day to come. I mean, there's a number of new products we're launching and other initiatives we're doing to be able to offset that growth dynamic four years down the road. So in the short term and in the interim, I think we're in very good shape.","Joseph Giordano","Great. And then, Brian, on the portfolio, you mentioned application software probably heavy, network heavy. Is there any like kind of an obvious theme without giving away too much information from a competitive standpoint, but feel like there was an obvious medical theme for a while, an obvious infrastructure theme now. Is there something new that you're looking at or is it more fill-ins to existing kind of platforms that you have?","Brian Jellison","No. I think that there's some common themes that override that all the way, right? So we know the kind of business it's going to have, hopefully has deferred revenue, so we're paid in advance for what we do. And it's going to have high margins, it's going to have the sort of mid-single-digit growth or better often times. And it's going to be something that's niche, that's critical to the customer that's actually making the decision to deploy it. It's not going to be something that goes to some value-added reseller that's making adjustments to it. It's not going to be software that the customer itself is using to rewrite stuff. It's going to have some implementation service associated with it that we're not going to spend a huge amount of time servicing it over a long period of time. And the market, it's going to be something that the customer allows him to make more money so that his decision about what he's willing to pay for the software or network access that he's getting from us is a no-brainer for him.","And so then it's really the kind of thing -- I mean, I can't describe the ones we're looking at now. But each one of those, they're not huge revenue companies of their own right but they're controlling billions of dollars of revenue. And so people really want them. And that's true of a whole lot of things. I mean, you can think about like a toll tag business, well, gee, it's a couple hundred million. Well, no, it's bringing in maybe $85 billion. Gee, it's a trade network at a grocery chain at $100-plus million of revenue. No, it's $8 billion of transactions. So the kind of things that our people do have very far reaching broad applications with lots of money involved, just it's not our revenue. And those are the kinds of networks and software applications that we're looking at right now.","Joseph Giordano","Is there anything on the application side around Neptune? I feel like there's been a lot more kind of technology going through the metering channels there. Is that something that Neptune is just doing organically on their own? Or is there maybe opportunities there to add more on like the analytics kind of software side there to that business?","Brian Jellison","Well, we have some other investments and activity that help support that. But what happens at Neptune is that as we build -- everybody else kind of went with one idea and they're trying to drive one idea. And what Neptune has done is by making everything backward-compatible, when you take something that's really quite old, still allow a customer to move forward without having to change out everything, and that's an invaluable thing. Other people force dramatic change on customers, and a lot of them don't like that. So that's an important part. I mean, Rob, you may want to add to the -- of course, we've established an Atlanta technology center, it's a big deal and we're staffing that rapidly?","Robert Crisci","Yes, that's exactly right. So we have been investing organically in software in Neptune quite a while and that continues to ramp. And as Brian said, we are doing that in Atlanta. A lot of exciting things. I mean, it's such a great customer base. Our solutions really drive the ability for the customers to collect the revenue and I think there's a lot more things we can do to continue to help the customers get better over time. And we're making those investments today that we feel confident will pay off in the future.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alexander Blanton","I wanted to ask about what you said about compressor controls. You said that the -- I believe you said that the orders were coming in better than expected for 2019 projects, is that correct?","Brian Jellison","No, I wouldn't say, Alex, those were orders, but we're seeing a lot of activity. And so if you went back to the bigger LNG [indiscernible], $30 billion kind of projects that people knew would be out in five years. What we're seeing is a lot of smaller projects in the $1 million to $2 million arena that people are considering for 2019. But we wouldn't see an order for those until 2019 and then delivery in '19 and '20.","Alexander Blanton","Okay. So indications, future orders are better than expected. What's the reason for that? Why do you...","Brian Jellison","Some of it is around exports, some of it is around people seeing an opportunity for some of the things to be profitable that they thought maybe couldn't be profitable before. How much of it is the pricing mechanisms they're seeing, it's really hard to say. Each one of those customers has got his own concept about why he's talking to us, but the important thing for us is they're talking to us. And 12 months ago or 15 months ago, we weren't having any of those conversations with anybody.","Alexander Blanton","Is that partly related to the price of gas, you think?","Brian Jellison","I just don't think -- we're not going to make that call. I mean it could be. You'd have to ask each one of them, right? So these are big guys. It's certainly got to be related to their view of macroeconomics, whether that's the price of oil or a change in the ability to export or something around LNG projects or the fact that they've under invested for a very, very long time and eventually have to -- and they're beginning to start that cycle on getting back to upgrading their older areas.","Alexander Blanton","Yes, well, the lower price of gas should lead to greater usage of gas, and that would help you. Second question is on the first quarter tax rate, I might have missed it, did you explain why it was only 18% versus 23% for the rest of the year?","Robert Crisci","Yes, just timing on deductions related to stock-based compensation.","Alexander Blanton","Okay. And thirdly, I don't have a really good sense of where the energy segment is relative to the past peak. That business fell way down a couple years ago. And just where are we relative to the past peak?","Brian Jellison","It's still probably off by at least 40% from the peak. The one business that's actually ahead of its peak, and it's Cornell Pump, and that's because it's not much an energy business. They do a lot of club sale directly on packaging stuff. But Roper Pump, [indiscernible], Viatran, and [indiscernible] are directly upstream guys, so let's say, they're up 35%, but they were down 60.","Alexander Blanton","Right. So if you're off still 40% from the peak, what's going to take to get back to that peak? And when?","Robert Crisci","Yes, so all balanced, right? We have the midstream and downstream businesses that have not bounced back similar to the upstream yet, we still have -- the reason why we're excited about these green shoots of optimism for compressor control is going out a year or two, is it still hasn't really rebounded because it's very late cycle. But again, as you know, Alex, this is a really small part of Roper now from a percent standpoint. It's very difficult for us to predict if we ever get back to those levels or not. What we can be sure that our business leaders are going to execute very well in the environment they're in as they have done, and now they're getting very good leverage as the business has grown. That's really what we ask them to do versus us making long-term macro predictions.","Alexander Blanton","Right. But you've still got plenty of potential there, correct? In that segment?","Brian Jellison","Well, it's true, but it's still a very small part of the total. I mean, these businesses are never going to get back to be 15% or 20% of Roper.","Robert Crisci","Well, under 10%.","Brian Jellison","Not going to be there. They're going to be single digits of our portfolio.","Robert Crisci","Right. That's correct.","Operator","And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call, and we thank you for your participation.

I would now like turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Mary, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our fourth quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Director of Planning and Investor Relations.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. ","If you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our fourth quarter results on a GAAP basis. Results from prior periods are presented on an adjusted basis for comparison purposes, primarily related to revenue recognition around our Sunquest and MHA acquisitions. Reconciliations between this prior period GAAP and adjusted results are included in this presentation as attachments.","Now if you'll please turn to the next slide, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take questions from our participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We start here with an overview. I\u2019ll give you fourth quarter enterprise financial results discussion and then look at the segment detail that happened in the quarter and what the implications are for 2014 and then close out with Q1 guidance and the 2014 guidance for what\u2019s going on. We have some facts headwinds in \u201914. We\u2019ll talk about them. You\u2019ll find our guys a lot more robust as some early notes indicated.","All right. So we have the Q4 results, next slide. If you look at enterprise financial results, we had a record across the board for any quarter in the history again. We achieved record orders, record backlog, record revenue, record net earnings, record EBITDA and the orders as we\u2019ll talk about were really terrific. $900 million in orders, $889 million in revenue with a book-to-bill of 1.01. Gross margins hit 60% in that quarter. Wow, 60%, up 210 basis points. EBITDA was up 12% to $307 million in the quarter. Our EBITDA margin was up 80 bps to 34.5%. And an EBITBA margin of 34.5% really is another example of Roper\u2019s transformation that\u2019s occurred over the last several years. Our DEPS were up 11% to $1.65 in the quarter, above our guidance and our operating cash flow was up 11% to $236 million, getting dangerously close to $1 billion run rate there. We\u2019re very well positioned as a result of this quarter for 2014. So it\u2019s really a great momentum item for us as we move ahead.","Next slide, on the fourth quarter income statement, here you can see orders were up 16%, 10% organic orders. Double digit organic growth is a phrase we haven\u2019t heard for a long time. Revenue was up 9%, with organic at 4%. Gross profit was up 210 basis points from 57.9% to 60%. Our operating margin came up from 28.3% to 29% or 70 bps. Interest expense was about the same. Tax rate was a 10 bps headwind in the quarter, but not really material. And net earnings then came in at $166 million versus $147 million in the corresponding quarter, up 11%.","Next slide, if we look at the EBITDA and margin expansion, I think we're going to point attention to the fact that just three years ago our trailing four month EBITDA was $638 million and we closed out this year with $1.74 billion. So EBITDA in the last three years is up 68%. And our EBITDA margin in 2010 was 26.7% and people were always challenging us about whether we\u2019d be able to hold on to this margin. Fortunately we were able to improve them dramatically. So we picked up 610 basis points on our EBITDA margin to hit 32.8%. That\u2019s an internal interesting number for us because the S&P 500 industrials I believe had gross margins of 32% and we now are at an EBITDA margin for the entire year of 32.8%. Our EBITDA leverage from \u201910 to \u201913 was about 49% over those three years.","Next slide, we look at cash flow results. You can see cash flow reached $803 million. We had guided over $800 million as you may remember. Cash flow was up 61% in the last three years and in fact just in 2011, \u201912 and \u201913 period, we\u2019ve generated $2.1 billion in operating cash flow which really was nearly enough to fund both the Sunquest and MHA acquisitions for $2.4 billion in that period. Our cash flow profile when you think about going forward, we trend that out. We\u2019re going to tell you later that we think we\u2019ll have cash conversion numbers that are somewhat similar to the ones you see here. You multiple that against your earnings assumption and you can see there's going to be a whole lot of money and cash here for us to invest. In the fourth quarter, the operating cash flow was 142% conversion there over net earnings and our free cash flow of $227 million gave us cash conversion -- free cash conversion of 137%.","Next Slide, if we look at the balance sheet here at the end of the year, cash was up from $371 million to $460 million. A lot of that is outside the U.S. Undrawn revolver, you put the two together and our cash and undrawn revolver was $1.7 billion at the end of the year, almost the same as it was a year ago to $1.771 billion, even though we spent and invested over $1 billion in acquisitions. You can see the trailing 12 month EBITDA goes up to $1074 million from $925 million. So, the gross debt to EBITDA is 2.3. Net debt to EBITDA is 1.9 and of course we intend to continue to drive cash immediately this year.","Next slide, here we'll take a look at the various elements of the different segments so next slide. First is, and these are just listed in an array of smallest to highest revenue; the Energy Systems and Controls segment. Their organic orders in the quarter were up 14%. So that was pretty spectacular. Organic revenue was up 3%. We had a lot of strength in Compressor Controls and actually some renewed strength in our Petroleum Analyzer Control, which has several different instrumentation businesses in it. ","We did a small acquisition that we announced the last time called Advanced Sensors which is an offshore play on communicating information about the wellhead activity. And it's a small business, but it's very attractive for future growth. Zetec actually corrected itself. So it was as weak as we expected, but they had orders that tell us that really the worst is behind us in that business and that order flow in the fourth quarter will continue nicely into 2014 we believe. ","If you'll look here at 2014 orientation, we're saying we ended the year with a record backlog, so that certainly helps the momentum for Energy going into 2014. We see a lot of continued strength both in LNG and refinery applications for our businesses that focus on that. We think we'll have modest increases in some of the oil and gas markets which helped some of the other businesses in Energy and the nuclear activity headwinds are behind us. So that's an easy comp for 2014 performance and we're confident that this segment as a whole will have record performance in 2014.","Next slide; we look here at Industrial Technology. Orders were up 3%, really spectacular operating performance for these businesses collectively. The EBITDA margin these guys generated in the fourth quarter was 32.2% and these are in Industrial businesses. So 32.2% is pretty great and gross margins for these businesses were 51.2%. So they still are very unique in the industrial world.","We celebrated Neptune's 10th anniversary in December. Very proud to say that it\u2019s certainly been one of our incredible acquisitions over the years. 10 years into it, the leadership team is still in place with the exception of one retirement. And looking up, we've generated about $3 billion in revenue during that 10-year period with Neptune and very attractive margins.","We saw improvement in our material analysis business at Struers in Denmark. They're actually much improved in Europe and doing pretty well everywhere as global industrial production picks up. Our Cornell business continues to capturing customers and had a very strong quarter around orders given rental companies picking up once again and applications for dewatering pumps and irrigation. And the oil and gas activity which affects Roper Pump remained pretty soft in the quarter. As we look at this current year 2014, Neptune continues to benefit for the Toronto Project and we expect some growth still out of U.S. homebuilding, which pretty much gives us incremental growth because we have a high percentage share of the installed base in North America, and as people build homes, they tend to use the same water meter that's already hit in that area.","Roper Pumps' large diameter directional facility is actually up. It's going to ship its first product in the next two weeks. We're visiting it. That's a kick-off thing here, about two weeks. So they expect a much stronger year in '14 and we just came off of in '13, so have the capacity for these larger diameter directional drilling outfits that they're putting in place. We had modest growth in industrial production which continues to support the material analysis side of our business. And the cash flow in these businesses we expect to continue to be remarkable. These businesses collectively and the way we measure cash, return on investment are up about 50% and typical industrial businesses around 18% to 25%. So they're a wonderful group of businesses.","Next slide, in RF Technology you can see orders were up 11%, revenues up 13% and operating profits up 23%. We indicated before, we thought it would be a strength in the fourth quarter. It certainly was. Project activity continues pretty much as we expected around Texas and Virginia and Florida. The Software Businesses all had relatively good quarters and mid-single-digit growth on the revenue side for them, which is pretty good because of all the recurring business they have inside their platforms. Continued strength in the products side of Radio Frequency Products and some strong growth in our U.K. Water business.","For next year we enter in the case TransCore with an absolute record backlog and a strong project pipeline. One of the things that's neat again is we'll be celebrating TransCore's 10th anniversary in December of this year. So like Neptune, 10 years after it we got the margins up and growth sorted out and we'll probably complete about $5 billion in revenue during that 10 year period. So those have been two really spectacular acquisitions with longevity. Same story here other than for a couple of retirements, leadership team is in place. We've got George McGraw and Kelly Gravelle, Tracy Marks and Joe Grabias and a very strong leadership team.","The next point here is modest increases in the U.K. gas and water utility business that is better than '13 was. It's going to help our Technolog business in the U.K. a bit. And then the Software businesses all continued to see mid-single-digit growth. They do have exceptional margins and it's important I think to point out with the cash margins they have, that they really drive our overall enterprise growth, quite substantially because they support so much of the acquisition investments we could make with the cash these people generate.","Next slide; Medical and Scientific Imaging here is just, again long time since we've been able to say what we have at the beginning of this slide. The Imaging orders were up double digits. It's not a misprint. They actually were up double digits. Organics orders in the overall segment were up 12%. Organic revenue was down just a little bit with the strength in Medical offset by the revenue decline in Imaging, but the order situation we'll remedy that as we go into 2014.","Sunquest had very strong orders. Their implementation capacity continues to improve, which is going to help us a lot in 2014. Demand is still high with people trying to get in front of the meaningful use requirements. MHA was very strong across all the alternate site health care locations, with long-term pharmacy being out in front. We're seeing a lot of potential acquisitions in the MHA space. We've spent most of the second half of this year working with MHA on various acquisition opportunities and haven't closed on any. But there're certainly a lot exciting things to do out there. In 2014, we expect imaging to improve with modest growth and easier comps, which will make the overall segment easier to talk about. Double digit revenue growth at Sunquest; we've got record backlog now and as we can continue to implement and build capacity given a strong sales pipeline, we think we'll really outperform pretty dramatically with Sunquest.","Verathon is going to pick up in 2014 from a flattish year. This year they've got new and enhanced products, dramatically better quality processes that allow us to differentiate our products a little bit better. And we've got a lot of confidence in the management team. We brought a new leader in there in the second half of last year and we've got really quite a fine group of people. We've structured that business around product lines now. So people have P&L responsibility that will lower levels in the organization, which is always good. MHA growth continues with new customer additions and very favorable market conditions. I think as confident as Mike and his team are around that, the growth has just been really quite spectacular.","Next slide, so here we get into the guidance arena, next slide. So, for 2014 guidance, the full year we establish at $6.05 to $6.25. Our assumptions is that revenue would be up 6% to 9% in 2014 and organic revenue would be up somewhere between 4% and 7%. Pretty much all the businesses are up mid-single-digits, but we have double-digit growth of Sunquest and MHA that will move us up to the higher end of that range hopefully. ","Operating profit leverage we're assuming is going to be around 35% to 40% next year for that new revenue. But we do have a headwind that's quite an issue with tax. So you\u2019ve got the tax rate, looks like it's going to come in between 31% and 31.5% versus 29%. If we just look at last year's results, that's a $0.20 headwind on tax. So if you look at $6.05 to $6.25 and common size it with the tax rate of the prior year, that would be $6.25 to $6.45. But we can't tell you $6.25 to $6.45 because we\u2019re going to pay $0.20 more tax. So it\u2019s $6.05 to $6.25, folks.","Foreign exchange is assumed to be the same as it was on 12\/31. Diluted share count is about 101 million. And first quarter guidance, we're coming in at $1.30 to $1.35. That gives us linearity in the year that\u2019s consistent with normalized stuff in the past. Last year, the first quarter we had very, very low tax rate, and we\u2019ll have a more normalized tax rate in the first quarter this year, the R&D expenses and various things John can talk about.","Okay, next Slide. We go to the 2013 summary. Certainly, one of the most important things is acquiring a new growth platform in MHA which is creating a lot of opportunities for us, and it's another $1 billion addition to the continuing transformation of the company and we feel very good and confident about it. We achieved record annual results for the enterprise just across the board; orders backlog, revenue, net earnings EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. For the year, orders were up 13%, revenue was up 9%, gross margin was up 260 basis points to 58.6% for the year. Operating margin was up 130 basis points to 27%. Our EBITDA was up $148 million to $1.74 billion, and EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points to 32.8%.","We had record cash flow performance. Operating cash flow for the year was $803 million which is 25% of revenue. Now usually we tell people that, they look at you like that can\u2019t be right. No. Well, it is. Operating cash flow is 25% of revenue. Free cash flow is $760 million. That represents a cash conversion of 141%. And while we think about cash flow guidance for 2014, I think our view would be that our cash conversion on operating cash flow should be somewhere around 140%. So you can take that 140% conversion on whatever earnings number you think we have and that gives you a pretty good idea how we're starting out on our cash flow assumptions for 2014. So we thought it was a great year. Our operating people really outperformed. Had some very unusual headwinds that are all gone and behind us, and our transformation is certainly on track and we're looking forward to 2014. ","So with that, we can open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So for my first question is -- well first, nice quarter, and my first question is really relating to the guidance on the incremental margins. It seems like the 35% to 40% is slightly lighter than what we\u2019ve seen in recent years and yet you\u2019ve continued to acquire software related asset-light businesses that have higher margins. I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit higher. So there seems to be a touch of conservativeness there. Can you just comment on the incremental that you\u2019re expecting and why 35% to 40% is the right number?","Brian Jellison","In the fourth quarter, I think it ran 37% for operating leverage. There's a lot of amortization and these are non-cash. And so I think John can walk you through the forward mile, but we may be conservative. I hope we're conservative, but it is what it is. I think we're still -- I\u2019m still flummoxed by the tax rate because we've got Sunquest and MHA which are our fastest growing businesses paying 40% tax. All right, John, go ahead.","John Humphrey","So it's true that Sunquest and MHA are our fastest growing businesses, but as you know their revenue base isn't all that large. So on a V basis that's definitely nice and of course on a cash basis it's even better. But we also do expect to have growth across the enterprise, not just in our software business. So we're expecting to see continued growth in our RF segment, particularly in the first half as we complete some of the projects that we have going on, and of course project revenue comes in a little lighter than some of our product revenue and definitely lighter than our software revenue. But I think that -- I think the 35% to 40% is right down the middle with respect to what we've been able to demonstrate and what we see as far as the backlog and the growth and where it's coming from in '14.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And I guess one follow-up question. Perhaps, Brian you can comment on the acquisition pipeline. Clearly it's an important part of the story. It seems like you're well positioned in the first half of the year to do another large acquisition. And so perhaps you can just comment on what you're seeing in the pipeline today and what your thoughts on the market are.","Brian Jellison","Everything is for sale at the moment. I don't think I\u2019ve ever seen as many properties that are for sale. Also, we have never seen private equity as aggressive as they are. On pricing, we\u2019re still getting 7, 7.5 times debt staples on everything that's out there. I think putting it a little bit equity and it lines up with pretty high stuff. We remain really disciplined. I think that we will do, we would expect to do a large acquisition in 2014. We never have a timeline established about whether that's any particular point in time, but we're sitting here with a net debt to EBITDA like 1.9 times and we\u2019re already going to generate about $800 million, $900 million or more of new cash. So we're very well positioned to be able to do $1 billion plus type acquisition. In the last several months, we\u2019ve actually looked at a number of things that we thought would be quite in the $400 million to $600 million arena, but it is remarkable what some people have paid. ","We walked away from two deals, one that looked attractive, but somebody paid 22 times trailing for it, and the other one somebody paid 23 times trailing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a new standard, but it just shows you the assets we're looking at are highly, highly sought after. So they always have to fit through this perfect hole we have. So the management teams needs to want to be part of Roper and we need one -- we need that management team to -- we want to have them be part of Roper. We have looked at a couple of very large transactions, larger than we\u2019ve done previously, and I wouldn't rule that out. So I think the pipeline is more than adequate. It\u2019s a more competitive process than it has been for a long time and as long as high yield debt is in our view mispriced, that\u2019s going to be headwind for everybody.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Hey Brian, I think you may have answered this question and I\u2019d like to hear some specifics from John. But the issue with the tax coming up you said, I believe it was the Sunquest and MHA being taxed at 40%. So was it a mix issue that\u2019s driving the higher tax rate and is there any opportunity for any other tax strategies throughout the year?","John Humphrey","So, the second part first. Yes, there are always things that we\u2019re looking at, nothing that we\u2019ve really baked into the guidance for '14 yet. But just to break down the increase in the tax rate, about half of it, so we're going from 29% up to call it 31% to 31.5% range. About half of that increase is just changes in U.S. tax law, which is the R&D tax credit not being extended into 2014, and combined with last year, we had the benefit of not only 2013, but also 2012 for R&D tax credit and a variety of other things that were expended on January 1 of '13. So they rolled into '13 instead of being in '12. So, that's about half of the increase. ","We did have some tax planning initiatives that benefitted 2013 that are not expected to continue and the rest of it is the mix that Brian was talking about. We're just growing faster in the U.S. and that's where we expected to see the growth coming from in '14 and the marginal tax rate in the U.S. approaches 40%. So that pushes our tax rate up a little bit also. But we have things that we're looking at. We have projects that we're evaluating in ways to obviously always in compliance with the law but to be able to minimize taxes wherever we can and we'll update you as some of those are successful.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great. Then over on the businesses, the two areas that had been the softest over the past couple of quarters, Zetec and Imaging both sounded a bit better. Maybe you'd take us through the next level of detail on Zetec. What were the orders in the quarter and has there been any pricing giveback as you try to reload the backlog for this business?","Brian Jellison","Not for Zetec. A lot of Zetec is service work and the rest are probes that are now used and those are reasonable margin business banks anyway. It's just -- we had things that were going to start up that didn't. Of course, that really caused us to change our view in the third quarter. Orders came back stronger than we expected, even though they're flattish, but they're not going down. And we had a one-time large thing that happened in the fourth quarter with Zetec, so to be able to recover from that, which was a sale in the prior year of some assets. That was a big deal. On the Imaging front, the orders picking up 12% was a pleasant surprise. So what if anything's changed about the government investments and what's going to happen in academic research and changes with NIH, and more funding perhaps in 2014. It's hard to say, but all those businesses appear to be past their worst performance pattern. We've made a couple of people changes inside those businesses that hopefully are paying off already. So we'll see, but it should not be a drag on 2014.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Out of the $3.3 billion or so in revenue you've been in 2013, how much of that would you say is from -- in two buckets; software plus SaaS in one bucket and then other recurring revenue sources in the other?","Brian Jellison","Software, the (inaudible) -- if you look at the application software businesses, I always say -- yeah, I'll put TransCore into this activity, because all the ITS stuff, just like we had a press release. We announced that we're doing special traffic analytics and controlling all the red lights in a huge area around Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl. You can't do that without software. Now there's human involvement too. So you're not making a disc and sending it out, but it is application software and ITS is probably our large dollar revenue business. So I didn't include it in there, John hence did not include it in there. So it depends who you ask, but as far as I'm concerned --","John Humphrey","I think you have Brian, so he'll give the answer.","Brian Jellison","If you look just like the SaaS businesses, pure software businesses, we get more than a fourth of the Company's EBITDA out of that. In reality, you really look at all of our application Software businesses, Compressor Controls for instance is an application software business. It would be much closer to half or more of the total family of activity. Here, you didn't ask but it's a more interesting thing. We've been looking at these GICS codes for a variety of reasons and we have a GICS code established, which is electronic components or electrical components. So we looked at that. We don't have a single Roper business that's in that category, not one. ","So, Forrest ranking them, our biggest area is application software. Our next biggest area is health care systems. Our next biggest area is health care products and then an equivalent thing, the line of electronic instrumentation that would be more like the adjunct type of activity and not much of that goes into Industrial activity. And then we've got about somewhere between 11% and 13% that goes into Energy equipment because really our fluid handling businesses are much more oriented around Energy activity, particularly with fracing now than they used to be. And so the core industrial concept of making stuff for OEMs or making the industrial product is less than 5% of the enterprise now.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","And then just one easy follow-up, John, there was a little bit of a spike in corporate expense in the fourth quarter, is that sort of the run rate to think about or did you have a couple million of M&A related expense in there?","John Humphrey","So I would probably say yes to both of those things. We'd be looking at some level of acquisitions, like that's a part of our normal ongoing corporate activity. It will go up and down though. So it may not always hit in every single quarter. So I think building that in on an annual basis is fine, but being able to predict when that's going to happen on a quarterly basis is not quite as easy. Now also, a piece of the growth on a year-over-year basis, more so than our sequential basis is the increase in our stock price and the associated increase in equity and expense associated with that. We hope to continue that as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Just thinking about the sequential dynamics and what happens seasonally here. You guys had a pretty weak first quarter last year on organic down, so really there's some lumpy businesses in your portfolio at least with last year, in 2013 there were a few lumpy ones. How do we think about the organic growth dynamics in the first quarter or the first half versus the second half? I would assume that with the easy comp, the first half would be at the higher end of the range?","John Humphrey ","It's a good question. The last year -- Q1 was negative organic of 3% on orders and Q2 was plus 1% and Q3 was plus 3% and Q4 was plus 4%. So I think we view our organic ought to be in this 4% to 7% throughout the year. It\u2019s plus or minus 5% every quarter. So we don't see massive trend change. We do have a -- we should have a decent first quarter with some of the project work that we're doing. So I don't think there's a huge seasonality variant there versus whatever seasonality we have we'd expect it to be up 5%, 6%, 7% quarter-over-quarter throughout the year.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","So the easy comp doesn't help your -- you're not going to be at the high end or above the high end of that range in the first quarter despite the easy comp?","John Humphrey","Yeah, I think that's true. So let\u2019s think about that easy comp for a second. So that easy comp really was our Neptune business which had a lost customer. So it showed the decline, particularly in the first two or three quarters last year. So we do expect Industrial to be very good against a relatively easy comp in the first quarter. Other parts of our enterprise, particularly as we're building capacity around implementations at Sunquest, introduction of a couple of new products, the Verathon, as well as continuing to build momentum in the project work in our Energy Systems business, particularly in the CCC application software business. So those areas are probably a little bit more toward the back end. So, we have the easier comp on the Industrial in the first half, but more of a ramp-up that we see towards the backend on Energy and Medical, specifically.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","So that balances out. One last to just follow up; any mix considerations, either positive or negative from the moving parts of this year on an organic basis; better margin or worse margin businesses coming back?","Brian Jellison","Margins are remarkably similar other than the pure software businesses. I mean, they are all pretty good. It's like EBITDA in Industrial, 32%, right. So the lower margin business would be Imaging which is a relatively small part of the total, but if you're still looking at mid-20s in Imaging. So as things grow, the big issue with mix is if we've done instead of software or hardware applications in Radio Frequency with TransCore, you get into design issues and some actual human labor in getting things installed, which all is bad margin business, but it\u2019s part of the price you pay for the total. So some of those are really teens type margins and others would be broker type margins.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","One last very quick one. Looking back at '13, it was obviously a little more choppy than I think a lot of us would have expected, especially from you guys. Did that change your view at all on hey, let's get back on the horse here and so let's set an appropriate -- be a little more appropriate in setting the targets this year or you view '13 as really a non-issue and just when thinking about setting expectations for '14?","Brian Jellison","'13 had these three unusual things in it. So we had the customer issue at Neptune, the non-recurring multiyear contract and we've gotten through that. So, it's no longer a negative. So that helps organic for this next year. We had Zetec, which was a second half of the year negative that was impossible to predict, it can't get worse literally, so, we're in pretty good shape there. Then, we had a vendor issue in the second quarter which we've never had in the time I've been here and that's behind us. We've eaten that. So that will, on a GAAP basis I think we're going to look quite strong in 2014 versus '13. We had most of our business reviews for '14 and I think we all walk away feeling like there's a lot of optimism in the field. But our guidance is conservative because of this $0.20 tax hit, right. So $6.05 to $6.25 is the equivalent of $6.45. So it's the tax that's causing us the angst of going into 2014.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Congratulations on the 10 year anniversaries on those big businesses. I was also wondering though, that is often a cliff point for some level of amortization. Is there a significant inflection down in amortization in either or both of those businesses here in '14?","John Humphrey","Jeff, no, not really. Most of the amortization associated with those things, it was either customer related or technology related that was amortizing has already rolled off. We have a modest amount that will give us a slight pickup at the Neptune business, but not very much.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I was just wondering, Brian, just when you look across the health care businesses here, as we're just in the teeth of Obamacare rolling out and all this various uncertainty, is there any -- obviously you had the order pickup in the Imaging businesses, but is there any discernible change in behavior in the marketplace you're seeing from your customers or through the supply chain or anything?","Brian Jellison","Vitriol is going up with customers or as gentlemen you mentioned is to healthcare program, but for business, it doesn't really affect us that much. I mean, our products are all going into situations that are not Affordable Care Act driven behaviors. And the Sunquest situation is an enabling technology for compliance with regulations in addition to helping hospitals run better. So actually we're not really seeing anything there. We had the Medicare tax, the cost taxes, (inaudible) products. We try to keep that neutral inside the business, which has been a little bit challenging, but generally come out okay. So I don't really think there's anything -- if something changes with this in the next two years, it shouldn't really have a positive or negative effect on our results.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then finally, I don\u2019t know Zetec maybe and that isn\u2019t worth two questions on the conference call, but the outlook there, do you see anything coming out of Japan? Obviously, there's a lot of debate about whether they start the nukes or not. Is that any part of your view of the business there and how significant could that be?","Brian Jellison","This is a really small business and this business is well under $100 million in total revenue, and half of its sensors that get used to different stuff. So, there is very little materiality in that. It really is just \u2013 I don't think there's much that would happen globally or would have any material effect on Roper in any way around Zetec. This year for the full year it's certainly pulled down the Energy segment quite a bit. But Zetec is less than 10% of the Energy segment, and half of it is really sensors that can be used in all other kinds of industrial activity, and half or 60% in nuclear. So it's just not material.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","So, Brian, you did the walk by the quarters for Steve on how the organic growth range transpires through the years. Wondering if we could do that walk by the segments, how they stack up against one another?","John Humphrey","So, yeah, I can do that for you. In general, our expectation is for about the same amount of full year growth out of each of the segments, but a little more out of Medical and Scientific Imaging. So from that standpoint, Medical and Scientific because of obviously the backlog at Sunquest, the continued growth there around compliance with some of the regulations, and as people are just wanting to have upgrades and other functionality. So I don\u2019t want to put too much on to the regulation, it\u2019s also about increased functionality. So we see that plus the continued growth on the MHA side and some new product introductions. So we do expect more growth out of Medical than we would see out of the other three. The other three are about the same.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Interesting to hear that Industrial Tech would be grouped in as about the same. That's encouraging. And then on RF, you\u2019ve had four quarters in a row now with record operating margin. Just wondering if you could put a little narrative behind that; do you still see runway with that segment in the margin performance?","John Humphrey","I\u2019m sorry, Chris. What segment was that?","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","RF.","John Humphrey","So once again, with our expectation around leverage of being somewhere between 35% and 40%, that gives continued opportunity for margin expansion. Now, that\u2019s not necessarily true for every single business, right, some of our businesses are operating at 60% plus margins. We're not looking for margin expansion there. We're looking for more growth, but for those businesses they're operating a little below our overage, as they continue to grow, they bring the margin profile up accordingly and that's really where we see in most of the opportunity on the leverage and margin expansion side.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Looking at the double-digit orders growth in Medical and Imaging, I think you probably already answered this. How is that playing out in sales? A lot of those orders are going to come in first half or is it pretty even throughout the year?","Brian Jellison","As in relates to Sunquest, they're continuing to build capacity -- human capacity to help people with their implementations. And so those implementations things are directly related to how quick client can get it installed. So, they're less time sensitive as opposed to say, it's got to get done in the year types of projects. It certainly involves manpower in the hospital, involves manpower in us and we've been building those teams very, very fast. So I think if the clients are ready to start implementing off those orders, this is a year we'll have double-digit revenue growth and order growth may or may not reach that. So the backlog is really what provides so much safety around Sunquest double-digit growth this year.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","So would you say as your portfolio has shifted with the increased number of software companies, it sure seems like maybe in the past you'd been maybe more of a book and ship on the orders, it's fair to say that your orders maybe are lumpier, but sales are still relatively even, it's fair to say?","Brian Jellison","Yeah. We were looking at that preparing for the call. I mean, we've already entered the year with about a third of the full year backlog accomplished. So you'd still have to book and ship two-thirds of the full year's guidance on revenue within the year itself. We do have a lot more recurring revenue. So what we don't report -- we only report orders if they're going to ship within a 12-month period. So there's a lot of backlog that we never identify as backlog until the cycle has come up for the year. So we know there's a lot of recurring revenue, particularly in Radio Frequency and in Medical. So the book and ship is more around Industrial and Energy. And in the application software side of the business in Energy, we can look very easily at six months out, maybe even eight months out. So it's the rest of those businesses which maybe 35% in the enterprise that are booked and shipped within a quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Just a couple of things. On the Industrial Tech side, I presume given your segment lock-up on the growth rate, John, you're expecting Industrial Tech to grow maybe at the 4% number, maybe the lower end. I'm just curious, within that business, is it a macro expectation? Obviously, we've all seen industrial production numbers trending higher. That's the material side of the businesses. Is it mainly just a macro driver there; home starts, IP for that Industrial Tech business?","John Humphrey","So for those two portions, yes. The fluid handling portion is not as much macro as it is specific around oil and gas and some new product introductions and expansion of our own capacity in order to meet the customer demand that\u2019s been there for a while. So I'd say it\u2019s more in our control on the fluid handling side, more on the Industrial production and housing starts at the margin for the Neptune and the instrument side.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Your guys in the fields expect that front end O&G business to be healthier for '14?","John Humphrey","Modestly, particularly around directional drilling, not as much around rig count increase, but around feet drilled and the horizontal drilling and that\u2019s really where more of our applications are going, whether that's on the water side for Cornell or it\u2019s on the actual power section side for Roper Pumps.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And then just within the Energy business, when I look at the gross margin which was fantastic for not just the quarter but the full year, does that continue to have an upward bias given that more of that is Compressor Controls, software applications? Should we just continue to expect that to see drift higher, the gross margin there?","John Humphrey","The fourth quarter is always the best margin performance for our Energy segment, particularly as instruments are sold. We still have some customer buying behavior which is more year-end budget consumption activity where they\u2019re trying to make sure they use all of what was budgeted for the year. So the fourth quarter is always disproportionately high in terms of instrument sales and the volume associated with that helps the gross margin as well. Even though we don't have a lot of factories, we do get a little bit of absorption benefit as the volume goes up. So that's really what's driving that margin expansion. In addition to just some of the new products that are being introduced are a little bit higher margin than the things that they're replacing, but I would say that, that is incremental growth on the gross margin side, and the operating leverage that we get from that growth is going to drive the bottom-line performance.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And then just last question, John, could you provide us the GAAP EBIT contribution for MHA in the fourth quarter, either in dollars or percent?","John Humphrey","There was really no difference on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for MHA at this point. I think we disclosed when we acquired the business that it was a very healthy margin, 2 times the Company average on an EBITDA basis. I'll have to get back with you on exactly how much the amortization is associated with that, but I think you can probably get there just in terms of the change in amortization from Q2 to Q3, but we'll follow-up with you on that specific question.","Operator","That will end our question and answer session for this call. We will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Mary and thank you, all for joining us this morning.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results. Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.ropertech.com.","If we please turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also as a part of this presentation on our website.","For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of two items. First, the $2.5 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue or software acquisitions that we've made. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, a small inventory step up expense, related to the acquisition of RF IDeas last year in the fourth quarter.","Now, if you please turn to slide four, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll take a quick look at sort of summary of the enterprise financial results here in the quarter, and then look at individual performance of the segments and the outlook for each segments and then turn to the guidance for the remainder of the year and go to Q&A. So, next slide is simply the introduction to the Q2 enterprise results; next slide is the explanation of those.","So, orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter and our book-to-bill for the enterprise was 1.02. Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulls 1% away and acquisitions were up 8%.","We had really terrific growth in medical and in software, and water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments. But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down maybe in the high-teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%, but in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52% numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are across all businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in a way of non-cash amortization.","The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment that Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow. Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue.","Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective, because it did hit the low end of the range, but in a quarter where we had record orders or record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we've just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue and that's why we were at $1.56 million at the low range instead of being up at the higher end of $1.61.","Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which was strong in Q2. Year-to-date our operating cash flow has been $414 million which is 23% of revenue and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios.","Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it in a little bit. So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities that we see in the second half of the year and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance.","Next slide, here we're looking at the Q2 income statement. As you can see orders up 9%, book-to-bill: 1.02x, revenue up 5%, gross profit was up 6%, gross margin up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see amortization increased by $10 million and our EBITA performance, if we were reporting that way was lot better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios.","The earnings before tax number was down 2% and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%. Last year, we had an extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guide that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position. And that really \u2013 that $1.70 if you adjusted it for the $0.16 for that one-time benefit would have been $1.54 and this year we're at $1.56.","Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits. Here you can see, if we looked at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows, we were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. Then we have the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million.","So, those things were a $49 million headwind. If you look at the base spend at $843 million, you'll see we added $91 million to that number. So while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversarying, was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter or if you exclude oil and gas and Puerto Rico and the divestiture, we were also up 11%.","The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we'll be up more than 10% excluding oil and gas, but we'll have a better organic growth, so they'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars or at least until we do another acquisition. So, actually we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds.","Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process we had to make, remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. Two years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue and at the end of June this year, it's down to 5.1%, so a 90-basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%. So, we've got a faster receivables, and payables and accruals went up, as we'd like from 17.4% to 18.9%. So, we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half in the last two years from 6.2% to 3.1% and that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy.","Next slide. On cash flow performance, again extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue or free cash flow was 22% of revenue and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%. And note on this slide, you'll see in, two years ago our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million and last year we printed $433 million, but $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico, as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So, it's real money, but it was a onetime event. So, you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 million and this year's $414 million, our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half, but still conversion is great.","Next slide. From a balance sheet performance perspective, we continue to be very well positioned. You can see that, we've got a completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion last year. So, if you look at the cash and undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about 1.9 times. And that's after in that 12-month period, we've invested $1.450 billion. So, after $1.45 billion we still have a $1.9 billion debt-to-EBITDA number. So, ample liquidity we've got a very active pipeline. And really most of the numerous acquisitions that we're involved with now in late stages are application software companies and it's likely we'll be doing something soon.","Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail, and the outlook for each one of the segments. Next slide, all four segments continued to perform remarkably well. When you look at the kind of fall off in oil and gas that affects the Energy business, and to a lesser degree the Industrial Technology because Roper Pump is sitting in there. Here these two are clipping along with Energy at 26% EBITDA to revenue, and actually sequentially up from the first quarter, and Industrial Technology at 31%. So, those remain remarkable performance numbers. RF\/software business at 38%, Medical at 43% as you can see in the Enterprise as a whole running at 37% without the corporate expense.","Next slide. So, we'll take the largest segment first, which is Medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%. That came from eight points of acquisition and four points overall organic revenue, although imaging pulled that down by a point. So Medical organic in the quarter was 5% which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our Medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better and we certainly don't see that slowing.","Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in three of our Medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our Alternate Site Healthcare Solutions businesses where SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well. Our new product launches at Sunquest, which would be very important for 2017 and hopefully important yet as the year winds down are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline which is growing, growing really rapidly and we have a couple of large people that we're talking to but you would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably which you'll see below.","In the second half, we think that the organic growth in Medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products is going to continue, we think that trend. The alternate site growth strengthens here because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions. And then we actually have some favorable comps that will benefit MHA as the year unfolds.","The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption of many new products and while there are literally over 15 different things, that are being launched there are four core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest.","Our imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people, and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule. Importantly, and here when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7% which is down from the prior year, couple of reasons for that. The newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP, when you add back the non-cash amortization of 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% or the every dollar of revenue contributing. And on an EBITDA basis it's nearly 43%. So, a good mix between Medical products and software and service, and then imaging should do better in the second half.","Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly a split between RF and software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4% but the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%. Our toll and traffic had very strong orders but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract which finally anniversaried in the second quarter. So, that's a $10 million headwind that goes away.","And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen. The contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine, it's just that it's moving more slowly. And it's not the only thing going into Saudi Arabia these days, it's moving very slow.","We had very strong segment book-to-bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9%. Again, lots of amortization in this segment. So you see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points. But when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue and the segment and you see the EBITA number is $37.3 million, the EBITDA number is $38.1 million, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year.","We see at the bottom here in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the earnings, the segment organic revenue, we think will be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable. And we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about kind of ensuring their commitments, it's something that's not clear.","Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high-single digits with incredible cash returns that earns other investments and acquisitions. And then RF IDeas business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this bigger mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first two quarters.","Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment, here you can see that orders declined, well actually orders were up 3%, but the organic growth's declined by 1%, the divestiture was 3%. The organic, if you exclude oil and gas and Industrial was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump and we'd expected a big down, but it was down 44%. It's a little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is that it does appear that that's the bottom of the situation and of course Roper's Pumps' impact for the segment has dramatically deescalated as their revenue has dropped so much over the last two years.","Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people read about other people that are trying to sell their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance.","The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging as their revenue had been down sort of high-single digits. So, that bodes well for the second half.","If you look at the second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets. Although, there's a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business at Roper Pump is getting very small. Neptune and instrumentation will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas. And finally in the fourth quarter the divestiture will anniversary and go away.","Next slide; here we look at the Energy Systems and Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15% and it's really a tale of two different businesses, the test and measurement business which was okay, and then the oil and gas businesses which were off. So, oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our petroleum analyzer business excluded a small portion of upstream and has \u2013 was really flat with actually improved profit contribution.","But compressor controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than a third in revenue and de-levered at a quite high rate. We do feel that, from here, it's no longer is negative on a comparison basis as we started to see of course, some softness throughout the year. We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5% and this segment has some amortization which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4%, so we ticked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement.","In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue in Energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in any of those oil and gas businesses. We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in those oil and gas businesses. They're normal. So there maybe some optimism there and a fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise.","The industrial test and measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now, certainly in a low-to-mid single-digits growth mode and the margins there are going to continue to improve. And so that's quite good and the orders book-to-bill in the segment's about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control.","And we're into the guidance here, next slide, the outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a mid-point, I guess of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It's being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in the neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but it \u2013 we're going to be down more like $100 million, so that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project push-outs in tolling were another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors and currency is another $10 million. So there's about $60 million revenue hit there and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis. And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes a point or maybe two points off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the very beginning of the year.","We did a very through bottoms up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved, and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever the guidance we're going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The factors that brought it down, oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance.","In terms of an upside, certainly the toll projects could accelerate. I think the people had a clear view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy.","The product launches that we have could ramp faster than we have in our guidance, so it'd be nice but you know, you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of will augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers.","We look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage, and the EBITDA leverage is riding (24:45) a little better than a third of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue. And if we, what else we've got, the sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge, like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with the revenue being up by 10% or more excluding oil and gas.","Second half tax rates are probably around 30% and then in the third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63.","Next slide, here if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us, we normally we'd talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog, record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, all of which is good. The margins are good, but we hit the lower end of the guidance, so we just didn't feel like leading what was kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number.","Orders, as we said were an all-time record and up 9% with the backlog at $1.14 billion and a book-to-bill well above $1 billion. So, we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half. We get rid of the $10 million-a-quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now, here in the third quarter and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so little bit of a drag in Q3.","Revenue being up 5%, we were able to do that because we had sort of high-single-digit, low-double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. The EBITDA margin is fine, likely to improve in the second half a little bit. Operating cash flow is the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million. It will be stronger, as it always is in the second half. So, we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow.","Back in 2014, our oil and gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. And in 2015 that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year out at around $300 million, which will be less than 8% of the company and the upstream portion is going to be less than 2% (27:29) of the company, with the midstream being around 6%. So the worst is behind us for this kind of change and we're looking forward to that.","We've got a very active pipeline. We're open on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we'd expect to deploy $1 billion, but $275 million awarded thus far. And it's not going to be difficult to find a way to deploying that level of activity.","We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It really continues to drive our strategy. So, we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well on a growth perspective. It's just that the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico which was a win for us, even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue, keeps us all of our strategies alive and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out.","So, with that, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. We will take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey. Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Brian or John, I was hoping, you could start with bridging the guidance for third quarter and fourth quarter, just looks like the guidance cut here this morning is weighing higher obviously on the third quarter, down 12% versus consensus, but you're not as severe in the fourth quarter. And maybe is there some seasonality, is it the comps getting easier, better visibility on these product launches, but just some color there on the difference here, assumptions in the third quarter and fourth quarter?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Deane. So, you did touch on it. So one of the things that we're expecting for this year is maybe not historically strong from a seasonality perspective but stronger than what we saw last year. And that's not just on the Energy businesses, but also on some of the other Industrial businesses that have some more seasonal activity as customers flush out some of their budgets. So we do expect that for the fourth quarter and that's why, you see slightly higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter as we look forward to this.","My answer must have left everyone dumbfounded. Are we still live on the call here?","Operator","Yes, you're still live.","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Next question.","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So next question, Matt.","Operator","We will now hear from Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Deane must have dropped the mic. Good morning, everyone. How're you doing?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","He must have. And well, if he comes back we'll insert him back into the queue.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. In any event, maybe you can talk about the Medical business in terms of maybe amplifying your comments around the product launches, the favorable compares to MHA. And then what drives to 6% organic growth versus the 9% organic growth kind of for the back half?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we had \u2013 give Neil Hunn a chance \u2013 he's responsible for the Medical and software businesses there an opportunity to explain. The pipeline is growing candidly more rapidly than we could have even hoped for. And he can tell you a little bit about what these new launches at Sunquest are designed to do, so Neil with that fire away.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business","Good morning. Yeah, the second half is \u2013 have strength across the board. I'll break it down by product and software. On the product side, there's new products at Verathon that continue to gain traction. On the software side, a number of \u2013 I think we've talked about before, a number of faster-growing software businesses turned organic, Strata, Data Innovations, SoftWriters, SHP. And then with the second half really at MHA, we see likely, well they are easier comps and then the market conditions around new customer adds give us an opportunity to do better in the second half than the first half.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think people are more interested with Sunquest, so let's just talk about the launch of the new \u2013 you've got four major offerings and then you've got mid-teens in terms of enhancements and upgrades at Matt's group are putting in place that we're already starting to solicit revenue. So you might explain what those things do.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business","Well, Sunquest, very excited about Sunquest. The reality of the Sunquest is we have worked very hard for the last 18 months on a series of new products. We've talked about those number of new products that are being brand new or material upgrades or enhancement increases being in the high-teens. We're on track for all of that. We've just come off a great user conference at Sunquest, where the customers were excited about the roadmap and what was happening.","We've seen a pretty meaningful increase in the pipeline, the sales pipeline, the sales funnel activities that you'd expect to see coming behind a large number of new products. We'd like to see that pipeline convert in the second half. We expect it to convert in the second half. So, we'll see bookings momentum and then that will give us the momentum heading into 2017 for Sunquest that we've talked about in the past.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And switching gears to M&A capital redeployment. I think the messaging maybe up until this call has been a little more muted in kind of the second quarter given where public valuations are for a lot of companies, given where the cost of funds is. Maybe can you just talk about \u2013 do you think it's a difficult environment to transact deals, just given political uncertainly, a tentatively rising stock market, with an improving valuations and public fundamentals kind of bleeding into private fundamentals?","And then kind of perhaps some of your companies thinking about the alternative route for initial public offerings. Could you just talk about how you look at this environment, and how do you think Roper's going to be able to transact in this environment and what kind of cadence you guys can transact in?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think for us, it's kind of a perfect environment, although you're right about the pricing of assets and the expectation of sellers, is pretty high. But fortunately for us, we're not buying public companies and paying a premium for it. So, we're buying private companies that if they were public would trade at a higher value than they do trade in the private marketplace, which gives us always some beneficial arbitrage.","There are as many things available in the acquisition market as I've ever seen. We have looked at billions of dollars of transactions this year, and we're directly engaged with a couple now that have a higher likelihood of closing, I think than the ones that we were looking at earlier in the year because of the quality of the business. Lot of the people that are running these private companies aren't interested in becoming public. They would much rather join our firm \u2013 at the public equity in our firm that and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people. And I think that the acquisitions we've made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals and there are lot of niches within them that the largest people that are, roll-up people aren't going to be interested in, so it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us.","Now, the challenge I think for the multi-industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are as high a quality as what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than where they normally would because the interest rates are so low.","The highest quality businesses oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and, oh my gosh, look, they pay 12 times for something. Well, if you looked at the public company comp, it was trading at 25 times or 26 times. So, I think that people are focused on product-oriented, more asset intensive businesses that are trading at 12 times or 13 times because of very low interest rates and people are buying them for 12 times or 13 times or 14 times, we're not in that space. We're in a space where we're buying stuff at 12 times or 13 times or 14 times that if it were public would trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience and how to effectuate those companies joining our public family.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If you indulge me to one last question and I apologize at the offset to be a little impolite, but do you think this is the last guidance cut we're going to face for 2016?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I do. I've bet money on that.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll leave it there. Maybe Deane will get back upon his seat.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","We will now hear from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. When you \u2013 I don't want to beat on Sunquest too much, you've really talked about it, but can you kind of get into a little bit more detail what these new products are actually? Like what actually are they, how are they expanding the platform and maybe talk a bit about the competitive dynamics in that market versus you guys and that bit of concern, how that's been progressing over the last maybe 12 months or something like that?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a great question Joe. So Neil, why don't you kind of explain these four core products and then all the enhancements.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business","Sure. Well, I appreciate the opportunity. So let me give you a 30 seconds on the importance of what Sunquest does for our customers. So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do millions of tests a year. And what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes. So you get super high quality results at low cost to operate the labs.","So what Sunquest, the new \u2013 the turn of products ready at Sunquest is to extend that capability that's been steeped in the blood side or the fluid side of the lab and extend it to the other parts of laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside a hospital. So it integrates the blood and to the tissue, to the molecular genetics, very important product for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions.","The second one is a completely refreshed view about how do you collect samples at the bed side. It's mobile enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct, at the right location, with the right patient and get it to the laboratory as quickly as possible.","The third category of new products is helping the hospitals extend their reach into the communities, importantly in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. healthcare, hospitals want the laboratory samples that are in the community, meaning where the physicians that feeds patients into their hospitals, they want the blood tests that are collected and all the laboratory tests that are collected in the physicians' offices to be routed into the hospitals or laboratory not just to drive volume in laboratory but to get the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians' offices for ordering and resulting.","And then finally, the laboratory space has been vacant of any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations. So we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year.","Those are four net new opportunities. As we talked about earlier, there's a series of other meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrade to our core clinical policy and our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades number in the hundreds and so we're very excited about what the teams be able to build on a product perspective at Sunquest.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, it's really helpful. One, just kind of going with that, typically we see a pretty steep margin ramp in the second half for that segment overall and guessing most of us are probably in that boat right now. So, can you kind of talk us through what drives that historically, and is that something we should still think is applicable for this year?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It really is. It's something that we're expecting as well and it's truly volume driven. So, it's a \u2013 and this segment has our highest gross margins across the enterprise with gross margins that are north of 70%. Some of our businesses here even have gross margins above that. And so, as we see incremental growth on the top side, we expect that to fall through. And so that really is what drives the margin improvement as we go throughout the year.","And, that's true on not only the software-type businesses like Neil was just talking about, but, also our products businesses and particularly at Gatan and some of our imaging business where they have very high gross margins because of all the technology and all the R&D that we invest there. It does result in high gross margin. So, if the volume increases, we expect that fall-through to improve, and that results in a higher margin in the fourth quarter than what we had throughout the first part of the year.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, good. And then, just last from me quick. On the order growth at RF Tech, is that driven more by TransCore, is that software related? I just want to kind of link that with your comments on who becomes president on the infrastructure side. It does seem like a lot of the road builders and those kind of guys see pretty positive outlooks right now. So, I want to see what you guys are thinking about that business in the U.S., particularly in the second half?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as far as the numbers are concerned \u2013 I'll turn it over to Brian on the commentary around the business outlook. But the order quarter growth was both on the toll and traffic side where the book-to-bill ratio was very strong 1.14 I believe. But it was also on the software side. Now, a little bit of that is seasonal, is our CBORD business, in particular, which serves the college, the university market. They have a lot of their renewals and upgrades and security applications that are booked in the second quarter and then delivered or recognized as revenue throughout the year. And so a little bit of that is seasonal, but we saw a fundamental growth on the software orders as well, but the largest reason for the book-to-bill being well above 1 is the backlog that's building on the toll and traffic side. Even though we've seen delays there, we still see fundamental growth happening there in the second half.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning guys.","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, my first question's on the portfolio. Brian, clearly Energy's surprised to the downside, Industrial remains weak. But \u2013 and you guys are continuing to evolve as a technology company. I'm just wondering whether any of the end-market dynamics have kind of changed your view about the portfolio, wonder if there's any potential divestitures that you guys are considering.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I'd say the answer is no. You know what, we went into the year thinking that we'd be down about $100 million on oil and gas, which comes in a little bit into Industrial, mostly into Energy. I'm sorry, thought we'd be down about $75 million, now we're going to be down $100 million. So, that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50% or frankly 60% contribution. So, it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance by much at all. And, those businesses at the moment are just a free shot on goal for 2017 and 2018. They're on the books for well \u2013 extremely low basis. So, the only way if you were going to do something with them, you'd want to do either a straight spin or a sponsored spin or you'd want to do an RMT with somebody. It'd be safe to say that our phone's been ringing off the hook with people who want to do those kind of things. But we actually think there are substantial upside in those business, just not this year, and probably not in the first three quarters of next year.","But, if they start cranking just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results. So, we'd prefer to hold on to them, continue to invest. The Industrial business was 26% EBITDA in the quarter for heaven sake. And, the Energy business, we got 31% in Industrial and 26% in Energy. So, I mean these are really good businesses.","Most of our investors, when we talk to the long guys, their fear is, gee, if you put those someplace, how could we trust they can run them as well as you can. And, we always humbly say, well, maybe right. So, these are great businesses. They're just in a situation where if somebody's off 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are because they're so nimble. So, I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind in the second half, our guidance reduction wouldn't have been so great. And then no one could predict what happened with what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time and it's effected several of our businesses revenues in the second quarter, so.","I think the underlying pieces for us is we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to continue to drive a lot of performance over the years and they're a great annuity value for our investors.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. That's helpful color, Brian. Maybe switching gears, John, one quick question for you on the Medical and Scientific Imaging margins. In the first half of the year, down 250 plus basis points year-over-year. It looks like the D&A as a percentage of sales was roughly the same as last year. So I'm just wondering, were there any mix issues that impacted the first half as well beyond just the M&A?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I mean, the M&A does have an impact here, right, because we acquired CliniSys, which on an operating profit basis is below the segment average. And frankly, even on an EBITDA basis, it's below the segment average, right. Remember, the segment average here is in the low-40% EBITDA margin range. So the fact that CliniSys comes in at only in the 35%, maybe a little bit less than that EBITDA margin range even drags it down. So that is a contributor.","And then the other piece is, frankly, the relative mix between \u2013 so our Medical growth so far this year. And in fact for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, Medical product sales, still terrific businesses and great margin but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of a mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year and to an earlier question that's why we see some fall through in margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next participant is Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning.","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","If we look at the tolling and traffic timing, maybe dive into that a little bit more. I think you called out another $25 million or so second half headwind. I guess that's a mix of Riyadh and non-Riyadh pieces, but \u2013 is just a \u2013 does this project strength into the first half of in 2017, is that the best way to think about that?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is no question about this.","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, yeah that \u2013 the decision process \u2013 I mean look that decision's made, it's done, we've started, but we would have expected it to be in the thirties of millions of dollars and totally offset some of the issues with Puerto Rico. It's going to be above $10 million. How much above that is hard to say. If you'd really \u2013 they're doing a massive transit system over there. They've got lots of priorities. They're extremely happy with our performance. We're happy with the relationship. It's going to be extremely valuable over a long period of time, but in the short run, we're going to likely get at least $20 million less than we expected in the beginning of the year. And we've got somewhat less in the quarter. In this quarter and all of our numbers issues are really just around the severity of the upstream being far worse than we thought and the toll and traffic kind of stuff, if you look at the quarter is pretty significant. When you look at the year, it's easier to calibrate now.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the non...?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know just so you understand it's true, the projects are just getting pushed out. So if we're not having them now, they'll come in, whether they come in in the fourth quarter or they come in in the first quarter, they're going to come in.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And that holds for Riyadh and non-Riyadh, correct?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely correct.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the Neptune growth was really standout. Any lumpy there or is that just broad-based rich execution?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's a combination of market share growth and all the normalized stuff and then them getting what we knew would be the lion share of new business from a customer that they didn't do much business with for the last couple of years. So, other people were talking about big revenue, we're showing big revenue.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, Energy Systems, you alluded to the \u2013 what's baked into the guidance is a weak 4Q seasonal ramp like last year, but you dangled positive surprise prospects in there. What's the kind of thought process behind dangling that?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we just don't know. Last year was \u2013 normally you get \u2013 basically because people have a lot of MRO left at the end of the year, but we didn't see any benefit of that because people just shutdown. This year, all year along anybody who's in the upstream business would know that people are cannibalizing what they've got, nobody is buying anything, rental fleets are in distress. But there're an increasing number of signals that would say that the cannibalization of all the stacked horsepower business out there, at some point will turn into new orders in revenue. We just have no idea where it will be. We do expect a modest improvement in the fourth quarter of this year, versus last year and could it be even better, I don't know.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next we will hear from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, good morning.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Brian or John, could you just speak for a second, the order number that you've put up there, what was the core order number in the quarter?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Organically, orders were up 2%.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Plus 2%, okay. And then, the assumption would be that that's pretty much driven by Med-Scientific is that reasonable core order?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the core \u2013 so the organic orders, I wanted to give that to you by segment. So, in the Medical segment it was plus 2%. In RF it was plus 9%. It was plus 2% in Industrial and minus 11% in Energy.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Energy, okay. All right, I see. Okay. And then, also within the Med-Scientific piece of the business, could you just maybe sift through the core revenue growth, local currency was plus 4%. How did the Medical products do versus the software and SaaS business? Is it \u2013 I was just trying to pick up on the cadence there. The software and SaaS business effectively much better in the second half, how was it relative to the 4% core growth this quarter?","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, the Medical products was up, I know it was in the 9% or 10% range, with the medical, software and services up I think 1%. And so, as we go throughout the year, that relative mix probably changes a little bit out if it goes to 8.2% or if it goes to 7.3%, but it's in that range. Maybe even it stays at 8% then the medical, software and services comes up a little bit. But that's the relative contribution right there. There's also little bit of what we were talking about with the margin impact and the outlook for the rest of the year.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I understand. Okay. And then, just one last question for Brian. You had mentioned earlier in the M&A pipeline, it was full, the application software businesses. There were a lot of those prospects in there. Is there anything that Roper could do in that application software area that would have more scale? We've seen good success with Sunquest and MHA, and tucking in some related businesses at Sunquest, at CliniSys and GeneInsight and Atlas. And I'm curious, do we stay on that path with the \u2013 more of the bolt-ons to Sunquest and MHA or is there something in there with some scale that we could pull in?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, it's a really good question. The answer is yes and yes. So, one of the incredible things about Sunquest and MHA is their platform status. So, if they allow us to do these incredibly attractive small acquisitions that we wouldn't do on our own. I mean, things like SoftWriters and Strata, and they're just really amazing. I mean, these are very high growth businesses and hopefully, we'll continue like that even though they're on a small base.","If you look at the last large transaction was Aderant. There are a lot of things that are sort of the size of Aderant. And Aderant also offers us an opportunity for some bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow its platform status. I would hope that the next acquisition we have is more like that where it's meaningful, it's something that we know how to do. People would be confident that we're already doing those kind of things. So that is likely what the next thing would be. Now, that said, this year we've looked at a number of very large transactions, and...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...those are always an interest. We're incredibly conservative and careful around those. But I would be disappointed in the next two years or three years if we didn't do a quite large transaction.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, are there opportunities or targets in the pipeline that are not Medical-Scientific? I know Aderant was an exception there. But I'm thinking, anything literally it's a bad word these days, but something on the Industrial side that would be more software or SaaS, is there any of those opportunities in the pipeline?","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there aren't a lot of Industrial situations. There are a few, but there are a lot of things that are not medical, that are vertical, just like Aderant is certainly not a Medical business.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Some of the other acquisitions we've made are not Medical at all. I think that you're likely to see some acquisitions that are not Medical at all, that's why we're kind of suggesting...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...there's a lot of attractive application software businesses that are immediately in front of us.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And there are project management businesses that are out there. Quite a few of those that are very interesting, some which are sort of horizontal opportunities and others that are small vertical. So...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have enough internal intellectual capital to handle a large acquisition that would not be in the Medical space.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call.

I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of the fourth quarter and full-year 2011.  Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results.  The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call.  We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.","If you could please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement.  During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements were are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings.  You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.","Now if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 3, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants.  Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thanks, John.  Good morning everybody.  So we\u2019ll walk you through briefly how the fourth quarter looked, what our full-year enterprise results for 2011 were, and what some of those implications are for positioning ourselves in 2012.  We\u2019ll go through the segment detail in terms of how we see 2012 by segment, talk about our guidance for the coming year, and then open it up for Q&A.","So next slide here would be an overview of the fourth quarter.  It was an all-time record quarter for us for any quarter in the history of the Company, and we had the most revenue, most net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating and free cash flow.  Total sales were up 9%, organic sales were up 7 \u2013 frankly, better organic sales growth than we would have expected back six or seven months ago, so things still look pretty favorable in that arena.  Gross margins were up to 54.9%, demonstrating that we\u2019re certainly not under a lot of price pressure in the marketplace and that everything we\u2019re doing continues to work exceptionally well.","EBITDA was 222 million in the quarter, which is beyond a spectacular number in our opinion.  EBITDA margins were 30.1% and certainly a milestone for Roper and speaks to the quality of the businesses that we have.  ","Our earnings in the quarter were $1.23 - we talk about that in the income statement here - up from $1.10.  Last year fourth quarter, operating cash flow was another sort of spectacular $193 million in the quarter.  That represented 158% of net earnings on a conversion basis and represented 26% of sales.  Free cash flow was 181 million.  Same story \u2013 149% of net earnings here for conversion, so it was quite a strong finish in the fourth quarter to what was an historic year for us.","Next slide \u2013 here if we look at the fourth quarter income statement, you\u2019ll see bookings were basically flat.  There are a couple reasons for that.  The fourth quarter last year, our orders were up 23% over the prior year, so it was an exceptionally unusual and difficult comp, and we had three things happen that we detailed last year.  We had quite a substantial Mexican order for Neptune - that tends to be a non-recurring type of item when those happen; some unique shipments in the camera arena around some specific CAPEX that was going on in China; and then we had a Gaz de France project largely booked and that was completed in the fourth quarter this year.  So those were unusual headwinds that exceeded $30 million.","The backlog is up though, as you can see, by 5.5%, so backlog was at $828 million which is an all-time record for a year-ending backlog number for us.  Net sales were up 9%, 7% organic.  Gross profit, as we covered, was up 20 BPs.  Operating income at 187 million was up 13%, and operating margin was above 25%, up 80 BPs in the quarter.  You can see the tax rate was actually a little bit of a negative headwind in the quarter compared to last year.  We had a particularly favorable tax rate in Q4 last year \u2013 27.7 for us, and the fourth quarter this year was 29%, so that cost us $0.02 a share.  Nonetheless, we still are in at $1.23 on DEPS.","Next slide \u2013 if you look at fourth quarter cash flow, it\u2019s for us kind of just a breathtaking accomplishment \u2013 193 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and that\u2019s up dramatically.  Last year, our record year was 155 million, and if you look at fourth quarter 2009 it was 120 million; so we just continue to pile up the cash.  If you look at the variances, it\u2019s up 24% as you can see on this slide from the fourth quarter a year ago, and 61% from 2009.","Next slide \u2013 here we\u2019ll start to look at the full-year enterprise results.  Next slide \u2013 we again achieved a record result on an annual basis as well as a quarter.  On an annual basis, it just again includes everything and the kitchen sink here \u2013 historic levels of orders, backlog, sales, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow.  Sales for the year were up 17%, organic growth for 2011 was 13%.  Remember, when we established guidance at the beginning of the year, we thought organic growth might be 9 to 11, so it came in substantially stronger than we had expected.","Gross margin was up 80 BPs to 54.2%, operating margin up 200 BPs to 23.6, which is really an incredible achievement for all of our 28 P&Ls around the world that are so terrifically focused on margin and cash and growth.  Our EBITDA for the year was up 164 million to 802 million.  By the way, we had a re-measurement gain in the second quarter and we\u2019re excluding that from this 802 million number; otherwise, it would have been 809, but that\u2019s a non-recurring item.  The EBITDA margin expanded to 28.7% for the full year and operating cash flow for the full year was 602 million or 22% of revenue.  Free cash flow at 561 million was 20% of sales, so another terrific year for the Roper family of businesses.","Next slide \u2013 here if we look at the full-year income statement, you\u2019ll see bookings were up 11% on the year.  Net sales up 17, organic 13.  Gross margin up 80 BPs, operating margin up 200, as we said.  Tax rate on the year came in at 29.4, which was 130 BPs headwind compared to the prior year, so that cost us $0.08 a share.  Despite that, we reported DEPS of 4.34, and the one thing we\u2019d point out there again is that re-measurement gain is in the GAAP number at 4.34.","Next slide \u2013 here if we look at our EBITDA growth, you can see the trends and performance in terms of capturing our gross margins in the form of EBITDA for our investors.  We had EBITDA of 802, as we mentioned, which is up 300 million from two years ago.  Our EBITDA margins two years ago were 24.5%, and common questions to us always are how are you ever going to keep those margins?  They\u2019ve got to degrade.  Nobody can have margins like this.  They\u2019re going to regress to some artificial mean that S&P 500 companies are stuck with; but that\u2019s not the case here.  As you can see, our margins were up from 24.5% to 26.7% last year and just continued forward at 28.7% this year.  That\u2019s a 420 basis point improvement in just two years in our EBITDA margins.","Next slide \u2013 our full-year cash flow, again, tells the story of Roper\u2019s business model:  602 million in operating cash flow representing 22% of revenue, free cash flow 20% of revenue, terrific execution throughout the enterprise.  Net working capital, still\u2014and our definition of inventory and receivables less payables and accruals is, like, 6% of less; so just spectacular performance from the field here.  And you can see that trend up from 367 million of operating cash flow in \u201909 to 500 to 602, and we\u2019re forecasting continued growth in 2012.","Next slide \u2013 we have a really terrific balance sheet.  We close out the year in a very strong position.  You can see cash was up 68 million to 338 million.  Our undrawn revolver is totally undrawn at 750 million; last year we had 520.  We get the benefit of trailing EBITDA coming up at 802; last year it was 638, so when you think about all those kind of investment-grade characteristics and multiply it times EBITDA, and you look at the powder we have, we\u2019ve got really a spectacular balance sheet.  Gross debt to capitalization is 25.4, and when you look at the net debt number, we have about 1.85 billion in gross debt.  With the 338 in cash, you\u2019d have net debt of 747 million against 802 million of trailing EBITDA, so it goes without saying that 2012 is likely going to be a strongly above-average acquisition year for Roper, and we\u2019re very excited about our prospects in that arena.","Next slide \u2013 here we\u2019ll get into the individual segments.  All of them are just faithfully executing the business models that they drive, and you can see there is just no softness anywhere inside the full-year activity.  RF technologies, sales were up 17%, operating profit up 35, and margins up 300 BPs.  Industrial technology was up 21%, OP up 29%, and margins up 150.  And boy, when you\u2019re up 150 and you finish at 28.2% OP margin for industrial flow control businesses, I can\u2019t take my hat off enough to the quality of the people we have and the niches we\u2019ve chosen to serve.","Medical and scientific imaging, sales were up 11%, OP was up 14, and margins were up 50; and then energy systems and controls was up 19% with OP up 31 and margins up to 50.  Overall, the team produced 13% organic growth.  They feel quite good about going into 2012, and the broad-based margin expansion we enjoyed this year, we think will continue next year.","Next slide \u2013 so here we\u2019ll look at the smallest segment as a function of the total of 21%, is medical and scientific imaging.  They had an unusual fourth quarter just mathematically \u2013 we\u2019ll talk about it- but really the story is the medical growth continues with even better prospects at Northern Digital than we originally identified.  Got significant OEM business that we believe is coming online in 2012.  We had organic sales decline in the fourth quarter, really caused by two primary events:  we had lower camera sales for an original equipment manufacturing video conferencing series of things that go on with one particular large client, and they were in decline this past year and the fourth quarter really brought that to a head; and then our rugged mobile computer shipments, which we rarely talk about because it\u2019s certainly not the key to our medical or scientific imaging business, but they enjoyed unusual activity in the fourth quarter last year with their rugged mobile applications into certain overnight shipping arrangements, and those really waned this year in the fourth quarter.","We had very strong margin performance in the fourth quarter against an all-time record last year in the fourth quarter, so we wound up with 25% OP in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, you can see sales were up 11%, OP 14, and margin up 50.","As we look to 2012, what we see in the segment is that medical growth, we expect to continue.  We have several new product launches that are occurring, generally starting in Europe and then coming into North America.  We expect those to provide a lift in the second half of the year.  We\u2019ll get the benefit of some growth from the Northern Digital acquisition in the first part of the year, and then it will turn into organic growth in the second; but we expect a very strong first quarter from Northern Digital.","We\u2019ve got significant backlog in the scientific imaging arena that supports modest growth of the year.  It\u2019s certainly going to be probably the low point of 2012 organic growth for Roper; but that said, given fears around research funding, as we\u2019ve gone through our planning reviews with people, people seem reasonably confident and certainly the physical science aspect of this looks better than the molecular and biological aspect does.  But on balance, it should be a net gain for us in 2012 and we are confident we\u2019re going to have margin expansion from growth in the other arenas.","Next slide \u2013 we look at the energy systems and controls.  Here, you can see just virtually all of the divisions here, with the exception of Zetec\u2019s nuclear steam-gen activity, have had very strong growth across the segment.  They all had record margin performance.  We continue to get our diesel engine shut-off systems that we\u2019ve talked about frequently\u2014continue to grow at a very rapid pace.  We don\u2019t see any pullback in that area.  We have had record results, really, for compressor controls, primarily due to the continuing expansion projects around the world; and you can see for the full year, our revenue was up 19%, OP up 31, and margin up 250.  To have OP in the fourth quarter at 30.5% is really quite substantial performance.","If you look at 2012, we don\u2019t really see any headwinds here.  We would expect that this segment ought to grow the fastest of our four segments in 2012.  It\u2019s got major drivers, none of which are waning in any way with the oil and gas markets remaining favorable.  Compressor Control has a backlog that assures its success for the year.  ","The bolt-on acquisitions, which we haven\u2019t talked a lot about because they\u2019re small \u2013 United Controls done earlier this year \u2013 gives us access to very substantial OEMs that we haven\u2019t been involved with in the past.  Trinity is a software company in the U.K. that\u2019s just coming onboard now.  It\u2019s modest revenue but it gives us a lot of technology and it\u2019s going to allow us to get compressor control even more embedded in software activity.  And then Hao Ying is a Chinese company; it\u2019s our first Chinese acquisition that we acquired for Dynisco.  Dynisco is enjoying very nice growth.  Probably everyone is aware that tire manufacturing CAPEX is doing well, and the things that Hao Ying can do for us in China are similar to what we do in the U.S.  We have a lot of new products coming online, and having our own in-house manufacturing capability and distribution channel reach directly in China for the rubber industry is quite useful for us.  ","Next slide \u2013 here if we look at industrial technology, fourth quarter was up 20% in sales, 25% in OP, margins at 29.2%.  Let\u2019s not be confused \u2013 those are not gross margins of an industrial company, those are the operating margins of our flow control businesses.  Fluid handling, very rapid growth from new customers, expanding oil and gas markets here.  Certainly fracking is driving a significant portion of our growth.  Very important indicator for us \u2013 our material test business is headquartered in Denmark, along with the Dynisco business I just mentioned, were two of three indicators that late in 2008, about the downturn for \u201909 that were people going to experience, and they finished the fourth quarter at a very strong rate \u2013 up over 20%.  Dynisco finished very strong as well, so we haven\u2019t seen any sign of any deterioration in forward activity.","Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S. despite the concerns that we and others would have had about the municipal market, and the fourth quarter was favorable for Neptune and we delivered both growth and execution with these record margins.  Full year, you can see sort of similar \u2013 20% in the fourth quarter, 21 for the year, OP up 29, margin up 150 basis points.","For this coming year, we really don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to arrest the trend.  The major drivers \u2013 we get a big benefit from the Toronto project at Neptune, which will roll out more rapidly in 2012 than it did in \u201911.  We don\u2019t see any pullback in any of our flow control businesses, and then we have new product and material tests that ought to allow that to continue to grow, so we think it will do nicely in the high end of any range we\u2019ve established for organic growth.","Then we look at the RF technology business, and here in the fourth quarter we had sales up 4%, OP up 12, and significant margin improvement \u2013 up 190 BPs.  The organic was flatter than\u2014it was far better than what it looks here because we had the completion of the France technolog\u2014Gaz de France automated meter reading project, which was completed; so from a revenue viewpoint, it helped us all year, but in the prior year it had been in the bookings so that was sort of an artificial headwind on a comparative basis.","We had very strong toll tag shipments that offset somewhat less project work in tolling in the fourth quarter, but we continue to have growth in our software as a service subscription and software maintenance businesses.  We had really a terrific contribution throughout the year from our college campus software and integrated security solutions out of CBORD.  They accounted for a significant portion of our growth in the full year, and importantly you can see the full-year sales growth for RF was up 17%, OP up 35, and margin up 300.  We\u2019re encouraged about margins in general in RF, so when we look to 2012, what we see is continued growth in the software and SAS businesses that we have.  We think toll project and maintenance growth will be stronger next year while tag shipments will be lower.  We have this headwind that we have to get through with the Gaz de France project that won\u2019t recur, although we\u2019ll have ongoing service with it; so that will be a drag into 2012.  But the operating margin expansion that we expect to see by having the software businesses becoming a bigger portion of the segment and the backlog that we have in this segment gives us confidence that we\u2019ll produce both more cash and operating profit in 2012 in RF.","Next slide \u2013 here as we get into the 2012 guidance \u2013 next slide \u2013 the full-year guidance for us is 467 to 487, and the assumptions around that is that organic growth would be up from a 5% at the low end of the range to 8% or more at the high end of the range.  Last year, we said 9 to 11, I believe; this year 5 to 8, given all the uncertainty in the world, seems like a rational approach to this.  We\u2019re assuming currency is the same as it was at January 31, 2012.  The tax rate, we\u2019re assuming is going to be about 30%.  Share count creeps up a little bit from 98.5 million diluted shares to 99.5 million.  First quarter, we\u2019d see coming in between $1.01 and $1.05; and full-year operating cash flow should exceed 650 million in 2012.  I\u2019m sure some people worry \u2013 we haven\u2019t commented much about Europe in here.  It\u2019s not overly significant for us.  We don\u2019t see much difficulty in Europe.  Our businesses there are often exporters to emerging markets, so we remain pretty comfortable with what\u2019s happening in Europe.","Next slide \u2013 if you look at the 2011 summary then, we had an all-time performance record for orders and sales, net earnings, cash flow, and EBITDA.  We had terrific margin leverage\u2014you know, when we look back on the year, one of the things I didn\u2019t cover that\u2019s worth really talking about in the income statement is if we look at the difference, we were up\u2014operating income reached 661 million, up from 514, so that\u2019s 147 million up in operating income while sales were up by 411 million.  You take that 147 OP and divide it by an incremental 411 in net sales, and you get operating profit leverage of 36%.  So our leverage is still world-class and we expect that to continue in 2012.","Operating cash flow at 602 million speaks for itself.  Twenty percent free cash flow to sales \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can find people doing that, and our family of businesses and our end markets are continuing to look quite reasonable for 2012, so we expect to have another record year in 2012, and we certainly are off to a good start.","So with that, John, I think we\u2019re open for questions.","John Humphrey","Okay.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  We will now go to our question and answer session of the call.  If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone.  We ask that our callers limit their questions to one main question and one follow-up.","We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt Summerville with Keybanc.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","Good morning.  A couple questions \u2013 first, Brian, can you talk about in your oil and gas-related businesses, whether or not a reduction in gas rig counts, an increase in oil rig counts \u2013 is that good for Roper, not good, or are you guys indifferent to that?  And then I have one follow-up.","Brian Jellison","You know, Matt, we\u2019re probably indifferent to that, although it\u2019s probably a little bit better for us on the oil side than on the gas side.  We have products that are used on both of those applications, and as Roper Pump in particular, they\u2019ve continued to expand their new products and in fact have worked with our Dynisco business on some polymer technology for one of their power sections, which allows that to be utilized in downhole oil applications as well as what they\u2019d been doing previously for gas applications. ","So we\u2019re largely indifferent to that, but also remember an awful lot of this is about building the base and expanding into some channels that we hadn\u2019t been in before, so it\u2019s not only the growth in the drilling activity overall but also some good channel development that those guys have done.","Matt Summerville \u2013 Keybanc","And then can you sort of what through the same thing, specifically talking about Compressor Controls, more around kind of the application-specific things that are driving what Brian seemed to describe as a backlog that gives you very good visibility through the year.  Is this mostly\u2014are you seeing good replacement or retrofit activity, or is this new capacity?  And can you talk about what you\u2019ve been doing maybe on the power side of that business as well?","Brian Jellison","Well, generally what happens with us is while we do OEM to certain very well-known manufacturers, most of our business is aftermarket business so we get a whole lot of several year out from new CAPEX activity where people want to see us deploy better technology for their controls than perhaps they had in the original purchase.  It\u2019s just a phenomenon that\u2019s not unusual, so people who are looking for productivity or more throughput or less consumption of the gas in the pipeline frequently are going to choose us.  That business, we\u2019ve really become quite effective in distribution channels around the world and are sort of growing in China as well, so we really have\u2014anybody who wants to have LNG operations that are as efficient as possible in getting the least consumption of gas inside their gas turbines is likely to look to us as a solution provider.  That reputation just continues to build, so from an aftermarket perspective, the projects that we get a bid on\u2014I mean, it would be not the least bit unusual for us to have six months of backlog at Compressor Control and known service work that\u2019s going to fill things up.  ","In fact, we completely redesigned our Des Moines headquarters last year, created a much, much more engineering-oriented facility that gives people an opportunity to work in teams in a very different way.  It\u2019s certainly among our most exciting businesses we\u2019ve got, just world-class human resources in that business.  We\u2019re at the early phases of our growth, frankly; and good heavens, if we got to exporting gas and LNG, it would be phenomenal what will happen to our business in that area.","Matt Summerville","","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","","Good morning, gentlemen.  Congrats on the quarter and year.","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Mark.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Let me talk about the medical \u2013 obviously there\u2019s some weakness in the whole segment, but you had some tough comps.  But what degree is that attributable to some product introductions?  You mentioned you have some new products rolling out in the back half, so does that keep people on the sidelines a little bit?  And what gives you a\u2014","Brian Jellison","No, no.  These are not substitution products at all.  These are entirely new products, but we\u2019ve had an ongoing ramp-up on certain kinds of positioning devices for MRI technology, we\u2019ve got new products in Verathon around GlideScope.  We have this Heartscape product that we\u2019ve launched in Europe that we haven\u2019t brought into the U.S. at all yet.  We have a product called AortaScan that is a phenomenal product.  All these things are just ramping up \u2013 in fact, we have an international sales meeting starting Sunday night with the Verathon people for three days to try to gear it up.  We had a similar situation last week with our CIVCO people around growth opportunities outside the U.S., so we\u2019re quite comfortable with that.  And really, any\u2014this organic stuff in Q4 has really not affected medical much in any way.  Medical is still performing very well.  We expect it will continue to do that.  This is really much more about a business that we have stuck inside scientific and imaging because it just doesn\u2019t fit anywhere, and that business had a really strong Q4 last year which is quite unusual, and it had its more normalized weak results in the fourth quarter of this year.  So that\u2019s\u2014rugged mobile has for a long time been not a typical Roper business in terms of performance, but we\u2019ve got a lot of energy in that business and people are hopeful for a much brighter 2012.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thanks.  And then moving to industrial tech, I mean, it actually accelerated growth versus the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.  I assume a lot of that is due in large part to the fluid handling, the material test.  And then looking in material test, how much of that is automotive driven \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 and what do you see going into \u201912?","John Humphrey","Well, I mean, the derived demand for that business is really anyone who is utilizing or looking to understand their material contents better; and so as one can imagine, that does include one who is making steel or aluminum or other types of really hard surface materials.  So there is obviously some impact from automotive production and for the supply chain, even though we don\u2019t really sell very much to any of the automotive companies, or even the Tier 1 automotive suppliers directly.  We have some sales there, but that\u2019s not the primary end market.  But clearly the fact that automotive production has come back in 2011 and is expected to grow again in 2012, I think is adding some benefit for our material test business.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","And is it safe to say that the non-Neptune businesses probably outperformed Neptune in the quarter?","John Humphrey","No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Probably on a quarter-to-quarter, maybe year-to-year.","John Humphrey","On an annual basis, the answer is yes.  For the quarter itself, I mean, Neptune continued to do very well; and remember, we are ramping up with the Toronto project, which did give us some additional revenue in the fourth quarter, and that will continue into 2012 and \u201913 and \u201914.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thank you.","John Humphrey","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you.  Good morning everyone.  For the orders this quarter, it\u2019s rare that we\u2019d see a book-to-bill below 1; and Brian, as I recall, any time this has happened \u2013 it really hasn\u2019t happened for, like, 10 quarters \u2013 you bring out these historical references about any time you\u2019re below 1.  You can see\u2014you get some one-off comments, but then look at the trend that comes back.  We didn\u2019t hear that this time.  You gave a little bit of the comp issue, but just put this in perspective about the order activity, bid activity, some of the leading indicators; because this is a little bit of an anomaly to see you below 1.","Brian Jellison","Yeah, well not below 1, Deane.  I think what we\u2019ve said is from 0.97 to 1.03 is kind of a band that we would have, and routinely\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know what percentage, a very high percentage of the time we\u2019re between 0.97 and 1.03.  But we had some unusual situations in Q4 last year \u2013 the large Mexico City project that we revealed to people in industrial in fourth quarter from an order perspective, and then obviously wouldn\u2019t repeat in the fourth quarter this year.  So that alone explains most of the book-to-bill in industrial.  And then RF is a lumpy situation \u2013 book-to-bill in RF was weak at, like, 0.9 or something like that.  We\u2019re not really worried about that.  We have huge backlog in RF and the non-toll project activity is quite robust going into 2012, so it\u2019s not much of a factor.","If we had a poor book-to-bill in the first quarter, then we\u2019d be talking more about that; but we wouldn\u2019t have established organic guidance at 5, 8% or more if we were really worried about the book-to-bill.  But it\u2019s a fair thing to point out because normally we would expect it to not be worse than 0.97.  This time, it was 0.94; but there were these three unusual events with cameras and rugged mobile and Mexico that aren\u2019t really core to the overall nature of activity.  So the rest of it was much more in our wheelhouse.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.  And for my follow-up, we pay attention to how you craft the expectations regarding M&A in a strongly above-average year, both in terms of fire power within the balance sheet.  But take us through what you\u2019re seeing in the pipeline, pricing, and in particular if opportunities to add on medical \u2013 there\u2019s big leverage to be able to drop in a new medical line into an existing sales force.  My question there is are you restricted at all as to what type of medical products that need to be complementary to some of your existing surgical products, or can you go into some newer areas on the medical side?  Thank you.","Brian Jellison","Well, we have kind of three different sales forces that are available to us, so at the low end you have the overnight delivery people with consumables and telephony-driven responses with hospitals around the world, and that\u2014we\u2019re extremely competent in that area with the right call centers, right SKU sorting, almost a mini-distributor function.  Then we have the technical cell around radiation oncology, which is a unique specific trait calling on a very small niche in the hospital and has to really be joined at the hip with major OEM manufacturers that are involved in that equipment.  And then we have the third sales force, which is the Verathon sales force, which is more generic; but they\u2019re selling products that are in the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars, not really CAPEX for the most part.  Those people have very specific people they call on.  It\u2019s organized into an acute care activity and a private practice activity.  It\u2019s easy for them to add things in those two areas.  Increasingly, we\u2019re investing outside the U.S. in channel presence, and that\u2019s doing really well.  So it is certainly possible that we can do a bolt-on acquisition and take advantage of our existing sales force in that area; but we look at a lot of things in medical, and I\u2019d have to say a number of the things that we look at are in software in medical, and we find those to be exceptionally exciting.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","And just in terms of expectations, how close do you think you are to making some announcements on the M&A side?","Brian Jellison","Well, you never know.  You just\u2014you never know.  I mean, we\u2019re sitting here with a lot of capacity, which is matched by a lot of patience.  So our goal is to buy things at the right price, at the right time, and have the right people in place to monitor them.  One of the things we did last year, which was very important strategically, is add two new very senior resources.  We brought Neil Hunn in to focus on medical activity.  Neil\u2019s an M&A pro, former CFO of a publicly-traded company running a revenue business in medical, just a world-class guy.  But we wanted to marry him up with a world-class software guy.  We brought Joe Bergera in, who has worked for Wolters Kluwer and Sage for his career.  Joe\u2019s a domain expert around architecture, platforms and software, and trying to get our software to leaders, more capable, doing more bolt-ons and activities.  So we have dramatically enhanced our internal capability to assimilate both software and medical companies, which we really needed to do.  I think the rest of us here in Sarasota were only interested in doing transactions that brought world-class management teams and didn\u2019t take too much more of our time, so now that we\u2019ve really beefed up our capability in this area, we have a lot more firepower intellectually than we did in the past.  Fortunately, that matches our balance sheet.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Good morning.  I\u2019d like to just continue that last topic.  You mentioned software as being an area of focus, and on acquisitions; and historically, Roper has acquired companies that were often converting from old analog technology to new digital technology, and that involved a lot of new software-driven equipment, so that the software really was an integral part of the equipment business that you were in.  That started with CCC, which by the way I was happy to hear that you think you\u2019re still in the early phases of growth with CCC, given that you acquired it almost 20 years ago.  In September of 1992, it was 17 million in sales, so at this point after 20 years, it\u2019s pretty impressive to be in the early phases of growth.  But it\u2019s software-driven, mainly, very\u2014equipment is only a small part of it.  ","So going forward, are you really going to go into standalone software, or are you going to just continue to acquire equipment businesses that have a high component of software?  Could you clarify that?","Brian Jellison","Well, no, it will be both.  If there was sort of one core in Roper that unifies the enterprise, it would be algorithms.  Every one of our businesses almost is dependent on some kind of algorithmic technology and feedback mechanism for people for data, and so that\u2019s almost always the core of something.  But our recent acquisitions, many of them have been pure software plays.  Certainly iTrade and CBORD and Horizon back in \u201904, or freight matching which was a core portion of what we wanted to acquire when we did the TransCore transaction, and of course it\u2019s now split off into a separate company.  We acquired another company called Getloaded, pure software.  They have a link up in Canada, pure software.  Certainly a lot of the acquisitions that we\u2019re moving through the pipeline now are software-driven things.  You know, I think every once in a while we\u2019ll look at an equipment business, but for the most part the software businesses or the digitization of analog businesses, as you pointed out, are more attractive in terms of a shareholder return on a cash-on-cash basis.  Our--","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Oh, absolutely.  But\u2014go ahead.","Brian Jellison","--just spectacular the last several years.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","But still, your\u2014this is software for Roper equipment, not software for somebody else\u2019s equipment.","Brian Jellison","No, that\u2019s true.  We\u2019re not\u2014it\u2019s not like Rockwell Automation or something, no.  We\u2019re not doing software for other people\u2019s products.  When we\u2019re saying software, we\u2019re doing software for other people who manage the cash in their channel; so if you look at what CBORD does, it\u2019s software that\u2019s managing campus activity and monetizing activity, and showing people what the flow looks like.  When you\u2019re looking at Horizon, it\u2019s pure software, no products, providing cash register support mechanisms and telling people about the supply chain.  When you look at freight matching, it\u2019s pure software subscription model where thousands and thousands of people are looking every minute about available freight movement.  When you look at iTrade, you\u2019re looking at people sorting through supply chains so that vendors can sell to supermarkets.  We like networks, as such, and we continue to look at software companies that provide niche networks to people.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Okay, thank you.  Second question is this \u2013 EPS last year for the year as a whole was up 29.9%, and that was well above your average rate; and of course, you also had some headwinds like higher tax rate and so on.  But guidance for this year is only 9.9%, less than 10% above 2011.  Actually, it\u2019s a little bit higher than the consensus, which was looking for a 9.5% increase, so it\u2019s not a big surprise.  But one of the reasons could be that you didn\u2019t make very many big acquisitions last year, so you have to depend more on the organic growth this year; but also are there any big headwinds that you\u2019re\u2014could you just go over the things that made last year above average and might be responsible for making this year below average in terms of EPS growth?  Because I think investors are kind of looking for a continuation of the long-term trend, which is about 20%.","Brian Jellison","Well yeah, you know, the long-term trend certainly includes acquisitions; our guidance doesn\u2019t, so it\u2019s that simple.  So if you\u2019re looking at\u2014","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","But you\u2019re going to make very many\u2014","Brian Jellison","Right, so you don\u2019t have them rolling in so much into 2012.  The last three years, we\u2019ve done about 1 billion, 1.25 in acquisitions, and we\u2019ve generated cash of about 1.4 billion.  So we\u2019ve reinvested our cash at about a 75% clip into acquisitions, and the next three years \u2013 good heavens, we\u2019re giving one-year guidance at 650, so obviously we\u2019d expect well over $2 billion in cash in the next three years, so that it\u2019s easy to see how that will carry.  When that does, you\u2019ll get a lot more revenue so the overall revenue will be going up.  So in any one year, you can\u2019t look at a step change; you have to look at what it is over time.  We don\u2019t see any disruption in any long-term trends around Roper.  I think we\u2019re going to just continue to have compound growth that\u2019s favorable, just it doesn\u2019t look like organic growth on an acquisition until a year later.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management","Right.  Yeah, what were some of the things, though, that last year might have in addition to not having acquisitions to roll in this year but might have made last year a tough comparison with this year?","Brian Jellison","Well, you had record performance last year.  You\u2019re looking at lousy GDP around the world.  You\u2019re looking at people who are terrified about a whole variety of end markets.  Our organic growth in the fourth quarter, I think is best in class.  Our projection around organic growth for 2012, I haven\u2019t seen anybody projecting 8% or more; so if we were simply at the high end of our organic growth and we captured the kind of leverage we expect to capture, we have more like 13% diluted earnings per share year-over-year variance, Alex, and that\u2019s without acquisitions.  So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going through the year without acquisitions.  So if you said can you get several points out of earnings related to acquisitions, the answer is yes.  So yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2014to go back over all those things that were favorable, we kind of\u2014we\u2019re doing that in the slides.  If you look at our statements going into \u201912, we aren\u2019t really describing any deterioration.  All you\u2019re doing is having a slower rate of organic growth based on an abysmal global GDP forecast and fears people have in Europe, so we\u2019re hoping not to participate in those negatives.","Alex Blanton \u2013 Clear Harbor Asset Management ","Yeah, thank you.  If you average the two years, it\u2019s right in line with your historic.  Okay, thanks very much.","Brian Jellison","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks.  Morning, gentlemen.  ","Brian Jellison","Good morning, Terry.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Wondering if we might be able to just help us with some color on where your organic expectations for the segments are, relative to the 5 to 8% for the year.  It kind of sounded from your comments like perhaps energy and industrial may be above the high end of the range, or at the high end of the range, and maybe RF and medical at or below the low end of the range.  But maybe you can put a finer point on that color.","Brian Jellison","Hey, I think we\u2019re still expecting double-digit growth out of energy and industrial in terms of organic growth in 2012, and then the bottom end of the range on medical and imaging and only modest growth out of RF because of the tolling activity, which is a big piece of that, with other stuff growing.  We\u2019ve got a few things that affect us there in RF because we have that headwind around the Gaz de France project, so you take out 30 million or whatever it is out of that, it\u2019s a big chunk that you have to beat up.  And so we actually\u2014if you were adjusting for that, we\u2019d have growth even there.  So\u2014and it\u2019s our first guess out of the box, right, that 5 to 8.  So clearly the industrial and energy segment will drive, but particularly energy is going to drive outperformance in 2012.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and Brian, maybe how are you thinking about the first quarter or cadence through the year?  Do you start stronger and end up a little slower towards the end of the range, or do you think it\u2019s even through the year, or how do you feel about that?","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t know, Terry.  It\u2019s hard to say.  I mean, we\u2019re expecting maybe 6 to 8% organic growth inside our guidance for the quarter with $1.01, $1.05 with really strong leverage.  Whether it could be better than that, it\u2019s hard to say.  I think we were impressed as we went through our year-end reviews with people that if you didn\u2019t have all the headline news and you didn\u2019t have the political environment and the conversations that are going on, our people would be probably be forecasting better results because they\u2019re seeing really excellent results.  They\u2019re not seeing a big fall-off in anything, but it tends to make everybody conservative.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And then I know there\u2019s a lot of noise, as you mentioned, in the 4Q orders; but I\u2019m just wondering if you were to try to strip out the noise, can you give us a sense for how the order trends were through the quarter \u2013 in other words, did you end up stronger than you started, or was it a strong start and a weak finish?","Brian Jellison","Hm, no, I don\u2019t think\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say month-to-month was a big difference.  I think the thing that we would have liked to have seen a little more year-end buying than we got in the fourth quarter that\u2019s just residual MRO activity \u2013 people have money left in their budgets \u2013 and particularly in energy, it\u2019s not at all unusual for us to get disproportionate mid-Q4 orders for instruments because it\u2019s just something people can do when they don\u2019t want to lose their budget.  I think their activity throughout the year was so strong that they didn\u2019t have that leftover money, and so we didn\u2019t see that dynamic that we frequently see.  But I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with Q1 demand or 2012 demand.  I think it\u2019s just that it was so strong all year long that people didn\u2019t wait to buy things.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And then just lastly, one more on medical \u2013 Brian, I guess I\u2019m just trying to discern, is there any element of the revenue miss in the quarter\u2014at least, I perceived it missed your expectations a bit - maybe you could calibrate that - that was just related to timing; in other words, it slipped by a couple of weeks or something like and that\u2019s part of what gives you the confidence on the Q1, despite the little bit softer order trends in the year-end.","Brian Jellison","Well, in the segment in medical and imaging, we have our very high end optics and imaging business that had a record year that didn\u2019t ship everything in Q4 that we would like to have seen, for a variety of reasons that I think we expected to have a banner 2012.  But it was more the unusual comp situation where we had basically laboratory camera technology that was going into Asia that was a one-off thing that couldn\u2019t be repeated, and then just frankly, without mentioning the company, the video conferencing business for that enterprise went down dramatically.  They\u2019ve talked about it in their own company, and it pulled down us, which makes for an easy comp for 2012 for us, frankly.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks.  Brian, I\u2019m impressed\u2014it sounds like\u2014I think I heard you have a sales meeting during the Super Bowl Sunday night. ","Brian Jellison","You know, I have a feeling that when that was scheduled that they perhaps missed the significance of the day, Chris.  And the amazing thing is it\u2019s not in Indianapolis.  It\u2019s actually in the northeast, so it will be quite interesting.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Yeah, someone will bring a transistor.  So you called out the scientific imaging as maybe the low point of organic growth for Roper, along with another number of companies, but doing particularly well.  But just looking for some color, maybe you put too fine a point on that.  Just wondering maybe about TransCore and Neptune ex-Toronto, how those trends are?","Brian Jellison","Well certainly Neptune ex-Toronto is better than we expected, and maybe John wants to provide a little color on that.","John Humphrey","Sure.","Brian Jellison","I think it\u2019s the rugged mobile thing which is certainly not a core asset that really had the very difficult comp measurement.  But why don\u2019t you talk about that?","John Humphrey","Yeah, as far as some of the other units you were asking about there, Chris, Neptune continued to do extremely well during the year, and they\u2019ll get continued benefit out of Toronto; but even excluding Toronto, they were up kind of in the mid-single digits in 2011 in the U.S., which I don\u2019t think most people looking at the municipal market would have expected something like that.  So I think Neptune did a very nice job there, and then of course with the high degree of recurring revenue that comes out of our TransCore toll and traffic business, that is a business that will naturally kind of be in the mid-single digits also, and that\u2019s kind of what it did in 2011.  And then variation that we see in that business is largely due to the timing of tag shipments, based upon when customers are going to replenish their inventory.  They\u2019ve done a nice job outside the U.S., our toll and traffic business has, with the expansion of electronic tolling opportunities in Puerto Rico, and continuing with the largest tolling project in the world in Dubai.  So we have a nice global footprint there and a large installed base that gives us a lot of visibility and good recurring revenue.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay.  My question was a little more forward-looking than the answer, but I appreciate the great color.  Is that kind of a trend you\u2019d expect to continue, and just\u2014it sounds like Neptune probably just continues to execute on market share domestically.","John Humphrey","Yeah, I think that\u2019s right; and also of course, Toronto ramps up in 2012.  And far as the toll and traffic business, I mean, as Brian said, to the extent that we\u2019re at the 5 to 8% for the enterprise, we\u2019d expect that to be at the lower side but with good margin performance.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah, just my two questions here \u2013 in the energy systems and controls business, just curious \u2013 were there any missed shipments in that segment in the fourth quarter?  I would have thought maybe revenue should have been a higher, given the bookings number through nine months in \u201911.","John Humphrey","No, I don\u2019t believe so.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, so that kind of met revenue expectations?","John Humphrey","Uh-huh.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And then also in industrial tech, a little bit curious \u2013 I would think you had a good quarter out of Toronto\u2014Neptune, Toronto.  I was just curious \u2013 is it mix that maybe pulled the gross margin in a little bit year-over-year?  What accounted for that?","John Humphrey","You are exactly correct.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, so that\u2019s primarily Toronto, then?","John Humphrey","And you will notice, of course, that even though the gross margin may be a little bit lower in the segment, the operating margin continues to expand.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I did notice that, yes.  And then lastly, one thing on the\u2014if we could just double back to iTrade for a second in RF Tech, you made some investments in Europe there and made some investments in the forward growth expectations.  How does that play out in \u201912 \u2013 are you seeing some visibility on the payback on those growth investments in iTrade?","Brian Jellison","Absolutely.  I think that we have one large turnkey operation that\u2019s going more slowly than we\u2019d like and more customer-driven, so we\u2019d like to see the pace of that pick up where more people are required to go online there.  But there\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s kind of their pace.  There\u2019s not much we can do about that.  But we\u2019re certainly looking forward to an even better 2012 in iTrade than we had in 2011.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, okay.  Very good.  Thank you.","Operator","And that will end our question and answer session for this call.  We\u2019ll return to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Okay.

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who heads up Planning and Investor Relations for us.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement.

And this also represents the last time we'll be talking about this adjustment, as we've now completed our 12 months and this deferred revenue adjustment is now completed. This adjustment does represent revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. Second, a fair value adjustment to revenue for MHA totaling $7.9 million. Again, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, MHA would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business.","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian D. Jellison","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. So the first slide here is the quarter 3 enterprise financial results. We achieved record results in the third quarter across almost every important line, and these are substantial increases in orders, in backlog, in revenue, in net earnings, in EBITDA and in cash flow.","Our orders were $846 million. Revenue was $837 million, with a book-to-bill of 1.01x, and backlog ended the quarter at $1.04 billion. Gross margin was really spectacular in the quarter, up 280 points to 58.7%. Our EBITDA was up 20% to $278 million in the quarter. EBITDA margin was also spectacular, up 240 basis points to 33.2%. Our diluted earnings per share were up 15% on the adjusted basis, and I think it was 17% on a GAAP basis. The GAAP operating cash flow was up 25% to $256 million. We'll talk a little bit more about how that positions us so well going forward. Very compelling margins and cash flow in the quarter.","Next slide. If we look at the Q3 income statement, you'll see orders increased by $126 million from last year, from $720 million to $846 million, an 18% increase in orders, with organic orders up 7%. Our revenue was up 11%, with organic at 3%. We'll talk a little bit about that, as that was a little less than we'd like to have seen on organic. Our gross margin was up sharply, as I said, to 58.7%. Our operating margin, which we probably ought to talk more about, was up another 160 basis points to 27.3%.","Now our tax rate actually was a $0.02 headwind in the quarter compared to the prior year actual as it increased from 29.4% to 30.3%, but that was somewhat consistent with what we expected. Net earnings, that figure is up 15% to $142 million. Now in the $142 million, we'll talk, when we get into the segment detail, about Zetec, which, against our expectations, as weak as they were, still delivered a $0.03 miss in the quarter.","Next slide. The EBITDA growth and margin expansion that we continued to have for a long period of time is still very sustainable, and you see it continue to grow. So here, if you look at 2011, our trailing third quarter EBITDA for the past 12 months was $779 million. It increased $93 million in the 12-month period from the third quarter of '11 to '12 and now has skyrocketed up another $170 million in the last 12 months, ending this quarter at $1,042,000,000. That's $263 million of increase in the last 2 years on a revenue variance of $461 million. So you can run your own leverage, but it's well above 50%.","If we look at the EBITDA margin, that continues to expand. In 2011, it was 28.5%. This trailing 12-month period ended at 32.6%, with actual third quarter results at 33.2%. So a 410-basis-point improvement in our EBITDA performance. And really, I suppose, on this slide, we should be detailing the other kind of margin improvements with gross margin and operating margin that continues to expand. And EBITDA -- or EBITA margins, if we look at just eliminating the D portion and look at EBITA, it was 32% in the quarter. So those amortization things, which are noncash, always are important. This is how we look at how we're doing and how we're getting all this cash.","Next slide. If we look at cash flow results, you can see they just continue to move on up. Frankly, spectacular in the third quarter, $244 million of free cash flow is 29% of revenue. Now you're not going to do that every quarter, but if you look at the year-to-date results, which is what we're stressing here because of the -- trying to provide some balance, our year-to-date cash flow is up $101 million from this point last year to $567 million. That gives us a year-to-date operating cash flow of 24%, and CapEx was only $33 million year-to-date. So free cash flow is $534 million year-to-date. And of course, we continue to trend up. So even though you see year-to-date at 24%, in the third quarter only, the operating cash flow was 31%. Cash conversion is just exceptional.","Next slide. We look at the balance sheet here, which continues to improve, even with our transactions. We finished the quarter with cash of $460 million and the undrawn revolver of $1,110,000,000. EBITDA, as we said, on a trailing basis is $1,042,000,000. If you look the gross debt number at $2,606 million and take away the $460 million in cash, our net debt number is only $2,146,000,000 against $1,042,000,000 in EBITDA, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.06x. So we feel we're in a very strong position from a flexibility viewpoint.","Next slide. Here, we'll take a look at the individual segment details, which are really quite interesting in the quarter. Next slide. So on Energy Systems & Controls, starting from the smallest segment to the largest, they certainly had a devastatingly difficult period with the Zetec nuclear business. We had sort of indicated we thought it could be down for the balance of the year maybe $10 million. We were hoping it wouldn't be that bad, but it's actually much worse.","The Zetec number in the third quarter was down 44% from the corresponding period a year ago because of this activity around shutting down various plants and not testing at the moment. And that wiped out our ability to have organic growth in the Energy segment in the third quarter. If we exclude Zetec, the segment revenue in the quarter actually would have been up 4%, not down 2%. So it's very unusual for us to have something like that, that has a distortion of the quality in the underlying businesses. All of this eventually turns into a various -- a variable positive in 2014, because these things will be tested and there will be activity. But it's just not going to happen in the second half of this year.","We also saw reduced activity in upstream areas in North American oil and gas, which was more severe than we expected. That affects not only energy, but it also affects our Roper Pump business, which reports through the Fluid Handling area. Not a -- certainly, still decent business, but very disappointing in terms of organic growth in the third quarter and probably in the fourth quarter as well. That was really more than offset, though, with improving contributions from our Compressor Controls business, which really is much more of a software company, frankly, and PAC, which is focused more on the midstream and downstream oil and gas areas.","If we look at orders in the quarter, they were only up 1%. But if you exclude Zetec, our orders in the quarter were up 7%. So really, without Zetec, orders up 7% and revenue up 4% would have been a satisfactory result.","If we look at the fourth quarter, we did an acquisition just right here at the beginning, the first week in October, of an Irish company called Advanced Sensors, which has a new proprietary technology for remote reading of information offshore. It's a very exciting technology. We very much like the people involved in this and think they're going to add to our online reading capability of a variety of things that PAC does. We see, in the fourth quarter, continued strength at Compressor Controls. We would expect record performance there. And PAC, really started to rebound in the third quarter, even though it was off of our expectations for growth, yet still was up nominally, and it will be up again in the fourth quarter.","Unfortunately, the nuclear weakness looks to continue. I think it's going to be down 40% here in the second half of the year before it starts to grow off of a ridiculously easy comp in 2014. And then the segment as a whole, we think will have kind of a mid-single-digit, 5%-plus growth in the fourth quarter.","Next slide. In the Industrial Technology arena, we see there's a little bit of carryover here, with the upstream activity in oil and gas affecting Roper Pump, and to a much less degree, the dewatering pumps at Cornell. We had a decent performance there, but that coiled tubing section that goes into drilling at Roper Pump was down sharply, cost us about $5 million in revenue in the quarter. Orders, though, were up 1% reported. This will be the last quarter we have that variance around Neptune's nonrenewal on the customer side. It would have been up about 3% without that.","We had very strong performance in Neptune again. It's certainly not fair to exclude the lost customer scenario, but without that, year-to-date, we'd be up nearly 11%. They had a very good quarter, very much bolstered by continued strength in Toronto, and the U.S. homebuilding gives us an opportunity to get more renewals and just add on normal replacement of water meters, plus the starts.","And then this has been an extraordinary year in winning a large number of small-sized communities. I think when we -- we looked at a targeted approach that was nearing 20 and we've gotten all but one, so very successful. I think our lead-free meter experience and the cost structures we have to produce it are really demonstrating the strength we have in this unique company, because its margins are certainly similar to the segment, where other competitors are talking about gross margins in the 30s and operating margins of 15%. So it still remains the class of the water metering and technology issue.","Material analysis growth, very strong in consumables at Struers, which was helpful. A slight decline in instrument sales. But in the first half of the year, their instrument sales were down more. They had very strong sales in Asia, with Japan and China, and it looks like they've turned the corner on the trend in instrument sales. We had terrific margin performance, operating margin at 30.3%, even though there was very limited sales growth in the quarter. These 30% operating margins, I think, just demonstrate the sustainability of the quality of these businesses.","If we look at fourth quarter, we don't see any improvement yet in the upstream oil and gas drilling activity. If that happened, that would be helpful. We see continued growth for Neptune because of the housing starts and the growing use of lead-free meters in North America. We think that the material analysis businesses will be a little better, as we see continued improvement in instruments. And then contributions at Cornell, they've done a remarkable job this year of adding new customers, which traditionally they hadn't gone after. And those additions of new customers are starting to produce more internal organic growth, and they look to have a little bit of a rebound in the rental market in the fourth quarter. So we're feeling -- even though the performance is quite good, we think it will get to be a little bit better.","Next slide. If we look at RF Technology, it's certainly had a remarkable quarter. Orders were up 13%. All of that is organic. So that's a terrific leg up, positioning us for 2014. Really, everybody in there is growing for the most part. We have broad-based improvement in toll and traffic; in the various software businesses, whether they're the subscription businesses or just licensed software; and the RF products businesses. The products are really around Inovonics, security-focused activity, and Technolog, which is our European data collection technology, they get sales[ph] through products.","Toll and traffic did better, which helps account for the revenue growth of 8% and increase in OP and margin improvement, at 28.3%. And even though it was good, it was actually a little bit under what we expected in the quarter because we thought that the Virginia project would get started early. It really didn't get started until September. So what happens is that, that then rolls forward to a certain capacity constraint that the state or the authority will have and we'll have a strong fourth quarter. And then what that really means is the expectation around the third quarter will get moved to the fourth quarter -- first quarter of next year, so first half of next year will be stronger than we expected around the Virginia project, we think stronger than we expected around Texas projects and Florida.","We had a terrific quarter in the campus software business, with CBORD and security applications, as we continued to get more wins from another company that's struggling at the moment. And then we have product expansion in our software businesses and continued subscriber growth.","In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit growth in the segment, certainly above 10%. The toll and traffic projects continue to ramp up. And plus, they'll carryover into 2014, so it's a great setup for us for next year.","The Florida tag technology upgrade has been accelerating, where we're putting multiple protocol deployments around various places in the state so that they can read different types of tags. And they're also upgrading to a tag which has an entirely different footprint than you have been used to seeing. It's a very small tag, probably not even an inch tall and maybe 2.5 inches wide and totally flat. It's a really exciting technology for them.","And we also launched, at the IBTTA conference in September, our go-anywhere pass, which, I think, people are delighted to see. There's a lot of -- we used to talk about HOV lanes, meaning high-occupancy vehicles. And now what people are talking about are managed lanes that allow people to move into a lane on a time-of-day basis or for some specific reason, and you can collect the fee off the tag. And that's opening up a number of new projects for us throughout the U.S. We think we'll have mid-single-digit growth in the software businesses and continued strength in these RF-product businesses, so a great story.","Next slide. Here, we're looking at the medical and imaging business, sort of a tale of 2 different kinds of activity, but just amazing results. Orders are up 52%. Organic orders were up 9%. MHA contributed exactly what we expected, very strong cash flow, a wonderful leadership team, extremely motivated people. Substantial number of wins for Sunquest. I mean, their building book for 2014 is really ahead of schedule. I will talk more about that here when we look at the fourth quarter.","We had double-digit growth in our image-guided surgical businesses, which includes Northern Digital and CIVCO. And the segment, because of imaging declining, was down about 5% in the quarter. Medical was up in the high-single-digit range to offset that. So we wound up with 3% organic growth. And of course, when we look at the overall business, revenue was up 40%, with the acquisitions' operating profit up 64% and OP margins now at 32.8% for the segment.","In the fourth quarter, we expect MHA to contribute the same way as it has, and we think organic growth in medical will be sort of similar, mid digit -- mid-single-digit types of numbers on the product side. Imaging end markets are going to continue to be challenging. We think they're going to be down 10% to 12% in the fourth quarter, but we'll be able to offset that with strength in medical.","Sunquest in the fourth quarter finally becomes organic. We didn't sort of split that as part of the quarter in the third quarter. And that organic growth will help our measurement when we're talking about just organic growth. Very strong pipeline of opportunities in Sunquest. We're going to enter the year with a substantial backlog around meaningful use and lab upgrades, which is driving demand. And the key for us will be our ability to execute with the implementation teams, and we're adding rapidly to those now.","Next slide. Here, we get to the guidance update. Next slide. If you look at the numbers, what we've tried to do is sort of segregate this little T-account for you so that you can see what's changed on the left-hand side, what remains the same about the company and what the effect of that is. Our operating cash flow, we maintained at -- saying we're going to reaffirm we'll do over $800 million in operating cash flow despite reduction in the Q4 DEPS guidance. Our DEPS, we came in at $5.57 to $5.63 versus $5.72 to $5.86 in the past. Q4 adjusted DEPS then are $1.57 to $1.63, and we've already earned $4 year-to-date, I believe.","So what's changed? Well, the Zetec nuclear business is going to be down 40%, maybe worse, in the second half. We had expected that maybe, over the second half period, we could have a $10 million headwind. But year-over-year, we're going to be down $20 million in Zetec, which was certainly not anything we ever imagined. Now the good thing about Zetec is that, from time to time, it's lumpy. And if you're off a lot, there is a permanent reduction in some aspects of it because of the closedown of 3 different reactors. But that said, they've got to test the stuff, and we're going to get that business. So it will help us next year.","Oil and gas drilling activity, we think, is going to continue to be weaker than expected in the fourth quarter. That's been kind of a double-digit millions, more than $10 million headwind in the third quarter and still more than a $10 million headwind in the fourth quarter. But we're still, in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter, above last year's actual. So it's really been more a reduction in our different businesses expectations about delivery, and it's all delayed -- it's all around the upstream, nothing in the midstream or downstream is negative.","Modest changes in the other end markets, mostly imaging, which is another headwind, as we said, down 10% to 12% perhaps. I guess the truth of that is that you are seeing some sequestration effect around that. Those businesses tend to be a little lower margin, so don't have as big an effect. That said, we think that fourth quarter organic growth will come in around 3% to 4%, and that's down from the 6% to 9% we had hoped for in the fourth quarter previously. But the reality is what it is, and we have to recognize that.","So what remains the same about the company? Well, most of the great things that we do. Organic growth will continue to improve throughout the year. In the first quarter, we reported negative 3% organic growth and then second, up 1%. In the third now, we're up 3%, and in the fourth quarter, we expect to do better on organic growth than we did in the third. And that sort of bodes well for 2014.","We've got key areas that are delivering organic growth continually, whether that's medical, it's toll and traffic, it's the water meter business and the systems around collecting data for the water meters and the midstream and downstream oil and gas and all of the software businesses. So those all are in fine shape and will do quite well. We've got this exceptional margin performance, with increasing leverage. I think probably something that hasn't gotten enough attention, which is our fault, our gross margins in the third quarter in 2011 were 53.7%. Our gross margins today are 58.7%, a 500-basis-point improvement in gross margin. And what that does for variable revenue and leverage is quite outstanding.","Our cash flow is still going to be $800 million, as we said, and our disciplined deployment around cash, which we've demonstrated with both MHA and Sunquest, at a time when other people are saying it's tough to do deals. We got a lot of opportunities in our pipeline. We remain excited about what's going on in our M&A front.","Next slide. So if we look at a summary of the quarter, we hate the fact that we had to lower DEPS guidance in the fourth quarter, but it doesn't mask the record Q3 results and the great setup we have for 2014. We achieved record third quarter results, and these weren't just, well, we beat by $1, these were substantial improvements in orders, backlog, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Orders, remember, we're up 18%, 7% of which was organic; revenue up 11%; and backlog at $1 billion; gross margins at 58.7%; EBITDA margins at 33.2%; and a $278 million contribution of EBITDA. DEPS up 15%, but operating cash flow up 25%. And our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flows, 156%. Free cash flow was up 24% to $244 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow conversion is 143%.","So with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to put this Zetec thing to bed a bit, Brian. If you look at the $0.19 reduction in EPS guidance at the midpoint, how much of that $0.19 is being driven by Zetec?","Brian D. Jellison","Well, it's quite a bit. I mean, in the second half of the year, it's going to be off at least $15 million. And so you have to use whatever assumption about its contribution would be. So it's not hard to see how it could be down $8 million or $10 million at least, and tax, it could be worse than that. So it's a significant -- it's the single biggest portion of what's going on, and then you got kind of a nut on the upstream oil and gas, which is -- caught us offguard, I'd say.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","With regards to drilling activity, I mean, it hasn't been super robust for a while. However, you had launched some new products in the market at Roper Pump. There was a pretty attractive market share story going on there. Is that still true in that regard? Have you anniversary-ed that launch and now you're seeing more of a broader market impact? Is that what's going on here?","Brian D. Jellison","No. That's a great question. The new product is called DuraTorque. It's doing very well. It's more around the directional drilling. It has a lot of different things, whether it's a mixture of wet product or dry product or gas only. It's a certain kind of thing, but our coiled tubing product, which much more is gas-oriented, is what didn't meet our expectations. We actually were up. We had year-over-year improvement. It's just that we had expected substantially more. Now the new product is doing well on certain sizes, and we're opening a new facility in Texas, which -- I mean, it's actually sort of open now, but it's all getting geared up. That will allow us to sell larger sizes. That's not yet in production, won't get in production until the first quarter of next year. So that's a positive, the -- as we gain market share with that technology in the larger sizes, but we can't produce those in Commerce. They're physically too large for our equipment.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, what do you think has to happen in the marketplace for you to start to see a turn in your imaging business, as this has continued to cycled down?","Brian D. Jellison","I'm looking at John. It's cycling down, but it's still -- it's better than anybody else's. It has high gross margins. It's contributing positive cash. Parts of it are really pretty good. I just don't think that the camera portion of what it is we do is a secular growth story. It requires government investment and research spending. We're in a period where that's under high scrutiny, and so there's not a lot of end-market-derived demand. There's nothing you can do to push elasticity in demand for cameras. People have to have grant money available. When they do, we get a disproportionate share of that. But if you look at any of the other people in these spaces, there aren't very many, it's kind of an oligopoly, you'll see they're all doing very poorly.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Brian, thanks for the color on the variance on 4Q. I just want to dive in to Zetec a little bit. Last quarter, you mentioned that there were -- I believe, you mentioned 4 nuclear plants that weren't going to come back. And so I'm trying to understand what the big variance was relative to your expectations for this quarter. So perhaps maybe we can start there, if you could provide a little bit more color.","Brian D. Jellison","Well, I think that people had certain expectations around various things. The San Onofre thing was a big variable that we sort of understood, and had factored that into the guidance. But these other things that have happened and not doing testing in the third quarter, fourth quarter, rolling it into 2014, was not expected. We also do a big business in Korea with that, and they've had some political issues over there with information reporting. And so the normalized business we would have expected there didn't occur. There -- it's just been sort of a dark period, if you will, in the second half. Our people in that business, I mean, we -- in our quarterly review, they detailed a bridge down to $100,000 of variance from a walk last year. So it's one of the things -- they tell you exactly what didn't work and in terms of why, and they would say, \"Well, it's just external things we have no control over, and we'll get most of it back next year.\" But it certainly -- it's not a growth business. It's more of a cash cow. But next year, because of this ridiculous collapse of its revenue in 2013, it will be a temporary growth business.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So is this something that then continues to bleed into the first half of next year because, really, the problem started surfacing last quarter?","Brian D. Jellison","Well, it's not expected to at all. It's expected that these things that are not happening in the second half would begin to happen again, favorably, in the first half, although I don't think they know what the detailed schedules are. We took quite a few people out of this business, I think like 24 or something like that, and didn't comment on that in terms of the cost to take them out. But that's about as much as you could do without eating into people that are really field service engineering people and guys that work on the algorithms and analysis for everybody. But the cooling towers are still in operation, and there are mandatory checks and they'll happen. So it's certainly not a part of our growth strategy. It's just been an unfortunate problem for us in the second half of the year.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I think just switching gears a little bit into some of the tolling projects. I think, last quarter, you mentioned that the Florida tag was moving into 4Q, could slip into 1Q. I missed your comments earlier. Perhaps you can talk a little bit about that confidence that you have in Florida tag, specifically for 4Q. What's embedded into expectations? Or has that slipped out into 1Q? And maybe some commentary around Virginia and Texas as well.","Brian D. Jellison","Well, we're going to have a terrific fourth quarter in toll and traffic. I mean, it's going to be very, very, very strong. The dynamic for the second half of the year, though, was we've had some projects that we expected would start earlier in the third quarter than they did. And so third quarter was good, but could have been substantially better. The ability of these agencies to deploy various things is kind of a fixed deployment. And so we'll have an exceptional fourth quarter, but that will then carry over into a very strong first half of the year for toll and traffic. I mean, I think John's going to be comfortable to say toll and traffic is going to be up over 15%, maybe more, in the fourth quarter of this year. So there really aren't any problems there. It's just a slower start than we expected.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just looking at the RF and how the backlog and quotation activity is maybe setting up for the 2014 top line. If you could comment on that. And is there any sense that 2014 could be pretty front-end loaded in terms of the full year expectation?","Brian D. Jellison","Oh, I wouldn't say -- I mean, we're not going to give you a lot of guidance around '14, but we're going to feel pretty good about it. So John, why don't you...","John Humphrey","Yes. And the projects that we have going on that, of course, started to revenue in the third quarter but really ramp-up a little bit more in the fourth, which is Virginia, as well as the Houston project, where we're replacing an awful lot of lane equipment with some of our proprietary lane equipment, in addition to the continuing Florida tag upgrade project. Those things started to ramp in Q3. They kind of reach a steady-state level in Q4. We expect that steady-state level to continue into Q1. And then we'll just -- I vow[ph] that they'll all have various times when they start to complete, but I don't think any of those projects will be completed even in the first quarter of next year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a big-picture question on operating margins for you guys. They're very high, obviously, across the segments. And just wondering if you could comment, what are the drivers from here in terms of mix, volume, leverage, et cetera. If you can kind of tackle that question on a segment-by-segment basis.","John Humphrey","Sure. So I think the place to look for insight into that is what the gross margin is for each of the 4 segments. So I think if you look at our medical and imaging segment, where our gross margin has now reached 70%, I think it's fair to say that every incremental dollar of revenue there means more than it does, say, in our industrial business. We love our industrial businesses, but we have gross margins there that are right at 50%. So you have a different level of contribution that's going to come from growth in our core medical area. And also, once you start to look over at RF, where our gross margins are also pretty high, largely as a result of our SaaS and software businesses. So in those areas where we have outsized growth, software, medical, MHA and Sunquest and things like that, then that -- I mean, that should convert at probably 50%, or maybe even a little more. In those areas like industrial and our core energy businesses, those things are probably closer into the 35% range. And so I think as you start to see us continue to build in some of those areas, I think you'll see the incremental leverage associated with that, and that's really what's going to drive the operating profit improvement as we go forward.","Operator","We'll go next Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Brian, back in September, you were describing the M&A environment and specifically, pricing of assets. I think the word you were using was horrendous. Maybe give us an update on the pipeline. And as your leverage comes down now well below your normalized leverage rates, do you have a Plan B in terms of capital allocation or you just want to keep all the gunpowder dry?","Brian D. Jellison","Oh, no. I mean, we're always involved in something. I would say that the pricing and seller expectations are as horrendous as they were before, which is why you're seeing a lot of things not getting done out in the marketplace. I mean, we're fortunate to continue to find things that we think are great additions to the family, and we can do that by offering people opportunities to be part of Roper in a way that works for them and still doesn't blow out pricing multiples. Their -- the pipeline is really quite large. There are a lot of different things that we're -- it would be a rare moment that we're not looking at 3 or 4 things simultaneously. And so I -- we don't have, like, a budgeted thing like, \"Gee, you did a $1 billion deal in the first quarter. Are you're going do another one in the fourth quarter?\" It doesn't work like that. I mean, we do them when everything sort of aligns. We like the management team, we like the core market, we think we can add some value to it, we think it's a cultural fit and we think the numbers work out over time. And we're definitely seeing things like that. Now that said, when the debt staples are as enormous as they are, oftentimes 7x debt-to-EBITDA, it gets stapled to a transaction. And junk bond, kind of high yield, if you want to call it that, is still very low, so it drives up the multiples. And that's as horrendous now as it was whenever I made that comment.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then I know this was a knit last quarter, but is the chapter closed on the Hansen refrigeration valve story?","John Humphrey","No, it's not. And so we continue to go through that process. We've shipped out roughly half of the affected valves, but we have not received as many back. So that process, for the field and for our installation partners, is still continuing as far as them being out in the field and replacing those products. But we're fully engaged on that. We expect to be about 90% completed with that part of the project by the end of the year. And we're still in the process of discussing with the supplier, the -- any restitution. So we will call that out once anything like that happens. As Brian mentioned back at the second quarter call, it's a pretty small company, not a lot of capital there. But we're still looking for the ability to offset some of this $9 million that we're having to spend in order to make sure our customers stay whole.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Brian, could you just talk for a couple of minutes about both MHA and then also Sunquest? You had mentioned Sunquest's backlog pipeline was strong. Does Sunquest now start to look like a mid-single-digit grower as it becomes core sales? And then the follow-up question to that is, if you look at those 2 acquisitions, MHA and Sunquest, if I make some estimates as to what their contribution margin in the quarter was, does the core business in med scientific, did they make progress on their margins or they slipped a little bit?","John Humphrey","So I'll address at least the first one of those, talking a little bit about our expectations for Sunquest. They've built, I mean, just a tremendous backlog with not only upgrades but also new facilities, so new badges as well, particularly as hospitals are continuing to comply with meaningful use regulations in order to be able to drive additional revenue into the hospital system. One of the ways that they can do that is better utilization of information, and MHA -- and Sunquest allows them to do that. So that's quite a bit of the backlog that we've been able to build there, and we expect that to start to deliver. It's already started deliver, but continue to ramp up deliveries against that in 2014, even in 2015. So I think -- I mean, you mentioned the mid-single-digit growth area. I would definitely expect that, and we would actually hope for a little bit more than that. And as we look forward -- so even if you exclude the contributions of both MHA and Sunquest, we did have margin expansion across the company. We had good incremental leverage on our -- on the 3% growth. Of course, it was 3% growth, so that incremental leverage works out to be, I think, in the mid-30% range, if my recollection is correct.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So the core in medical scientific, the incrementals is still kind of mid-30s there despite the weakness on the imaging side?","John Humphrey","Yes, that's correct. That's correct. It's really because -- actually, because -- even if you exclude the contributions of MHA and Sunquest, so talking specifically just for that segment, we still had net organic growth there, largely driven by our image-guided medical products.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just a real quick question. This Advanced Sensors business that you acquired, could you just give an approximate revenue size for that?","Brian D. Jellison","Well, it's really a new technology. So it's -- I mean, they have an expectation that they would be in excess of $10 million, but it could be really substantially better than that. They have a very substantial ramp that they think they'll get, and we'd like to believe they're right. But it's a [indiscernible] margin business. And they really do have a proprietary technology that when you see it, it's remarkable because, today, the way people get information at the wellhead or on the platform is archaic. And you could be sitting somewhere else and getting this information feed basically through a very different type of access technology. And it's where -- I mean people kind of see it and don't believe it. It was introduced in the second half of this year at a trade show, and they are under siege for people wanting to buy the product, which was one of the reasons that we were able to come in and acquire the company, because it requires some investment and has very interesting forward prospects.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Douglass of Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Brian, as we think about the risk to organic growth, not only in fourth quarter, but also looking to '14. Guidance taken down a couple of times. 35% organic growth guide earlier this year, not going to hit it. Obviously, Zetec is a big part of that, oil and gas. Are there other parts of your business where you're just lacking real strong confidence that things are going to turn? Or can you just talk about other risks in other businesses?","Brian D. Jellison","Well, in the fourth quarter, it's really driven quite substantially by these 3 things: the sort of almost freeze on nuclear activity, and then the upstream oil and gas, and then the camera reductions. Those make up the lion's share of everything. When you look about 2014, we're going to get solid growth out of all the RF businesses, we expect, and solid growth out of our existing medical product businesses and really, sort of everything in that capacity. Energy has had a somewhat disappointing year in 2013. So it sets up for pretty easy comps in 2014. And then you have industrial, which will have capacity that we don't have today for higher-diameter DuraTorque products in Texas. We think -- we've had 2 or 3 things this year that aren't going to repeat. So you ask this customer renewal situation, which was millions and millions of dollars, and you've got -- you're past the Zetec situation, which is millions of dollars. So we're setup for comps in '14 better. Now we haven't gone through our planning with all the field people, but we're looking forward to a strong year.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. But nothing -- I mean, any areas where you're just getting perpetually weaker without any of these big kind of onetime...","Brian D. Jellison","No, not at all. I think what you have is just you've got a pretty slow growth macro economy. And so there are guys who are looking to grow at twice GDP. You're looking at a pretty lousy GDP base off of which to grow. So if you get 3%, 3.5% GDP growth that some people think you'd get in '14, I mean, that's going to help some of those kind of businesses.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On that gross margin improvement, obviously, another great quarter there. Is there anything -- I know there's a mix dynamic because you've been buying stuff that's a little more high gross margin. What would you point to as kind of the 1 to 2 things that you're doing there? Is it mix? Is it -- it's kind of hard to -- for us to reach in and analyze that gross margin. It's just so strong that maybe if you could talk about a couple of the big drivers there over the long -- over the last couple of years.","Brian D. Jellison","Well, I think there's 2 different things, right? So the kind of things we've been acquiring have been high-margin businesses. Many of them get paid in advance for what they do, which drives so much of the positive you see here around cash. The other businesses have sort of focused on different kinds of disciplines around our market share and customer profitability. So they work very hard on making sure they're serving customers that make sense for them to serve, and not wasting time selling to people that are high maintenance and low margin. Our guys have a very disciplined approach around product development, and when they're looking at their product roadmaps, they're looking at ways to have contributions from the new products that are higher than contributions they had from the old products. So that continues to sort of anniversary beneficially to us. Now when you move 500 basis points up in 2 years, from the 53.7% to 58.7%, certainly, some of that is due to Sunquest and due to MHA a little bit in the third quarter. But pretty much everybody has improving gross margins.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right, yes. No, it's definitely pretty broad-based when you look back over the last couple of years. There's not really 1 segment that's carrying you there. On the leverage, is there a target where you would get more aggressive? Or are you pretty comfortable here deploying capital at 2.5x -- I think it's gross -- 2.5x gross?","Brian D. Jellison","Yes. I think we've said 2.5x, but 2.5x to 3x because we have so much cash. It really assembles so quickly for us. We wouldn't have any problem being at 3x or slightly above 3x for a temporary period, if we had a clear pathway to reduce it back. But from a sort of planning or modeling viewpoint, we'd like to think we're more like 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA on a gross basis. But we're not uncomfortable at a little over 3x as long as it doesn't stay there.","Operator","We'll go next John Quealy of Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","It's Chip Moore for John. On Zetec, it sounds like you have pretty good visibility on things coming back next year. Can you just talk a little bit about historical precedents, if you've ever seen delays like this?","John Humphrey","Not to this magnitude, no, where you have both a little bit of an impact from plant shutdowns and actually mothballing some nuclear facilities, in addition to what is a little more normal for Zetec, which is lumpiness. So quarter-to-quarter, lumpiness for Zetec is not a surprise. What we're seeing here in the second half is more than what we've seen in the past. So when you talk about visibility, it's one of those things that when I look 12 months out and look at what's going to happen over a 12-month period, there's actually better visibilty than looking out over a 3-month period, just because some of these things can be pushed or delayed, but they can't be eliminated, right? You still have to -- I mean, there are still regulations around shutting down and testing the cooling tower and the tubes and the other parts of the process. So that part can't be eliminated, but it can be postponed sometimes. And so that part is not unusual, but what we're seeing this time is unusual.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just a follow-up to that. You've mentioned taking some costs out there as you look forward. Assuming it bounces back next year, what kind of benefit can that have?","Brian D. Jellison","It's a modest benefit. People are not that expensive. It's 24 people times whatever, and some of them would be variable, you'd bring them back. So not material to anything Roper does.","John Humphrey","Right.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","This is sort of a nonquantitative question. You've had a lot of those so far today. But given the unusual nature of some of the problems that you've had here in the second half, I mean, you don't usually have misses in earnings estimates and guidance. How much of a distraction have these problems been, if any, to management in pursuing its acquisition program? Because that seems to have slowed a bit at the same time as some of these problems cropped up. Has there been a problem or not?","Brian D. Jellison","Not a problem at all, and I'm not sure how you could say it slowed. I mean, we invested $1 billion this year in the MHA acquisition. And that's...","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Well, that's true, but I mean in the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter, we didn't see much.","Brian D. Jellison","Well, hold on. I mean, this is the most aggressive acquisition investment deployment policy in the history of the enterprise in the last 2 years, over $2.5 billion. And we just announced the bolt-on now. So good Lord, what would you want in acquisitions. So our capital deployment is just off the charts compared to anybody else.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","Okay, okay. So you anticipate some good stuff coming in 2014, that I gather from that?","Brian D. Jellison","We always expect good stuff to come. I mean, we are going to deploy capital. We have proven that for a long number of years, and we're going to continue to deploy capital in great opportunities.","Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC","And would you say that you've got the operating management in place to handle the problems you've had effectively and minimize them?","Brian D. Jellison","I do think that. I think that these are macro trends and upstream stuff that has nothing to do with the quality of the management that we have at Viatran and the diesel engine shutoff valve business and some of the core AMOT businesses and certainly, the coiled tubing aspect at Roper Pump or dewatering pumps or any of these things. The underlying nature of those businesses is outstanding. You can see it by the sustained operating profit margin they have and their product roadmap. So I think that's fine. And any acquisitions we do, frankly, come with quality management teams. So assimilating them isn't very risky. So I think we're -- I mean, I could tell you that we have the best leadership group here at Roper right now that we've ever had, and it's stronger today than it was 5 years ago. So I don't think it has anything to do with sort of taking your eye off of anything. It's really the incredible negative reaction to people who were going to bring up nuclear power plants, who aren't the people who are mothballing them, and the big falloff in gas activity and sort of modest falloff in rig counts.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Alicia, and I thank all of you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again in 3 months, when we finish up the fourth quarter.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"19061":["Roper Technologies, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Robert Crisci, VP of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Rob Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Laurie, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the fourth quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Neil Hunn, Group Vice President.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also are available on our website.","Now, if you'll please turn to slide two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.","For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of two items. First, a $7.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, a $6.1 million adjustment for acquisition-related expenses, primarily related to the ConstructConnect and Deltek acquisitions which were completed in the quarter.","And now, if you'll please turn to slide four, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody. We'll start out by reviewing how the fourth quarter was, and a few comments about how the total 2016 finished. Then a segment detail on outlook for each of the four reporting segments. We'll look at how the first quarter looks from a guidance view point and the full year, establish our cash flow guidance for the year, and then take your questions.","Next slide, slide five. So, if we look at the fourth quarter, we had record results in terms of orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow and a lot of other areas as well. Orders were really spectacular, up 17%. Our book-to-bill was 1.07x. For those of you who follow the company closely, we always say something like a 0.97x to 1.02x is a trend line that doesn't tell you all that much, but if you get below that or above that it tells you a lot, and this sort of rate tells you a great deal about 2017.","We had organic order growth in all four segments, although I think Energy was maybe 0.1%. But it's still \u2013 that's the first time in a long time, organic orders were up 11%, now about half of that comes from the New York City tunnel project, but without that it's still very outstanding organic growth.","Our revenue in the quarter was up 7% to $1.18 billion with 2% organic growth. Our gross margin was up 50 basis points to $62.3 million. We're still making some margin improvement even with extraordinarily high numbers to begin with.","Our EBITDA in the quarter was up 7% to $365 million and our operating cash flow for the entire year for the first time in our history exceeded $1 billion. We completed an important bond offering in December that sort of protected us from the vagaries of what might have happened going forward. The interest rates at the time certainly saved us a good deal of money.","We deployed $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, acquiring Deltek and ConstructConnect and these are really transformational acquisitions for us, partly because of their size. But they really take us into software end markets and professional services, gives us a lot more diversification than our software which had been concentrated in supply-chain activities and medical application. So, moving greatly into professional service gives us a lot of ramp around other things we can acquire over the next several years. And it was a quarter-ago in which we hit several milestones and really some transformational things that outline how we're going to perform over the next three to five years.","Next slide. If we look at the income statement, you can see pretty much all those things reflected that we just commented on orders, revenue, gross profit. The tax rate down there you can see was 29.8% versus 28.8%. So it was a 1% headwind which cost us about $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, notwithstanding that DEPS were $1.86 versus $1.82 last year.","Next slide. Compounding cash flow is really what creates so much shareholder value for all of you over time. And, here you can see that despite the Energy headwinds, which have been ferocious for the company for the last two years, it's really remarkable that we've had 19% growth over the last two years in operating cash flow, despite a huge cash headwind in Energy.","So in the fourth quarter, our conversion of operating cash flow, you can see was 142%. Our free cash flow at $259 million represented 25% of revenue. And for the full-year, our operating cash flow, which is a little over $1 billion, with 149% conversion, we continue to move up sort of cash flow to revenue. Back in 2014, it was 23.7%, and of course people are scared to death we couldn't possibly maintain it, and here in 2016 it's 26.3%. So, everybody here is very proud of the $1 billion operating cash flow for the first time. It's quite a milestone and hats off to everybody at Roper for doing that.","Next slide. The asset-light business model, this will really cement a critical awareness of people about just how big a cash compounder we are and we're going to be. If you look at this slide, which we generally show you each time, people often times think it just couldn't get better. In 2014, you see that our net working capital as a function of revenue was 5%. Last year in 2015 it was 3.5%. This year it's 1.8%, cut in half, and it's important to look at the component, so you can see inventories dropped from 5.1% to 4.6% in the last two years, receivables are up 20 basis points from 16.1% to 16.3%, payables and accruals are up 80 basis points from 11.1% to 11.9%, but the big change here is deferred revenue.","Deferred revenue was 5% in 2014 year-end and in the fourth quarter, we exclude acquisition. So, in December 2015, we excluded Aderant and Atlas that had some deferred revenue, and yet it was still 6.5%. This year as we close out, we exclude ConstructConnect and Deltek and store up the 7.2%. This is hugely important because if you look on our balance sheet that's attached to the income statement, you'll see that deferred revenue in 2015 was $267 million. You'll now see that deferred revenue is up to $488 million, but this is not reflected in our graph here at 7.2%. So you can imagine that that 1.8% number, which is insanely low compared to multi-industry companies, is actually going to become negative in 2017. This is why we get so much more cash to revenue than virtually anybody else.","It's truly a transformational change in our cash return and to get a concept of how important this is, ten years ago we told people that our inventory was 9% of revenue, today it's 4.5%. We told people receivables were 17.4%, today they are 16.3%. We told people payables and accruals were 15%, today they are 11.9%. But now we have 7.2% of deferred revenue and as we report in the first quarter, you'll see that number escalate. So all of the acquisitions that we've been doing the last two years, $5.5 billion worth of investment, has helped to drive these incredible numbers to rates that just haven't been seen before.","Next slide. Here we look at the segment detail and we'll look at each of the four segments. Next slide. We start with Energy Systems. The Energy Systems business actually had a book-to-bill of 1.02x. We had organic growth in orders in the Energy segment of 7%, so you got a little bit of improvement in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue, trailing of course is still minus 8%.","Oil and gas was down about 15%, but that's actually the best negative V for a while. So headwinds have really been abating in that and this Energy segment, about two thirds of it is oil and gas related activity.","The Industrial Test and Measurement portions of the business actually grew, and we had this sort of positive book-to-bill ratio around that. In 2017, we think the segment'll be sort of flat to low single-digit growth, off of the base that you see here.","Then if we look at the Industrial segment, which is far less influenced by oil and gas, but nonetheless, still has Roper Pump in it, so that's a major component. Its organic orders were up 1%. The organic revenue was down 1%. Material analysis was strong in the quarter. Neptune continued to perform brilliantly. We had some sequential improvement for the first time at Roper Pump as rig counts moved up, and so Roper Pump sequentially was up about 8%. That said, that business alone in the last two years is off by $50 million of revenue and represents that drag that we've had. We think that goes away this year.","If we look at the results for the segment as a whole, we think it's going to be up sort of low-single digits, because we won't get much out of the Energy portions, but we get a lot more out of the other pieces of that segment.","If you combine these two when you look at it, which I was doing just in preparation here for the talk today, the combined revenue for these two was $321 million of revenue and had $98 million in OP. So it's really remarkable how great these businesses are. There are 30.5% OP to sales in markets that have been declining. So the guys who run these businesses have really performed in an outstanding way the last two years.","Next slide. We look at the Medical segment. You'll see a book-to-bill here of 1.09. Organic orders were up 8%. Total orders were up 15%. Imaging revenue was down 4%, but Medical organic growth was up 5%.","The way that we look at the businesses, there are really three primary areas, the Acute Care Software business, and it was up led by connectivity solutions between the lab instrumentation that we provide software for and the data gathering requirements that the hospital needs. And then, Strata's Decision Support Software continues to grow at a spectacular rate. The Alternate Site Healthcare business, which includes MHA, but very importantly includes our Software businesses, SoftWriters and SHP, the Software businesses grew well and the Long Term Care Pharmacy business grew in the fourth quarter.","The medical products business, which includes a variety of physical products, its growth was led by Northern Digital, and we have technology that a rapidly increasing people of OEMs that we really sign contracts with, I can't discuss because of the proprietary nature of the product, have really interesting growth opportunities in Electromagnetic Measurement Technology area, and we're really at the forefront of that. So, there is some very important people that we've been working with, and increasingly signing those up, and prospects for that area are quite good.","Scientific Imaging in the quarter was up on orders. It's about 15% of the segment these days. Book- to-bill was the strongest it's been over the long time at 1.12. In 2017, we actually believe Imaging will grow because of the cryo-EM opportunity that we have there and certain spectroscopy technology that we introduced this past year.","In Medical, we just think we get sort of broad-based medical growth continues at kind of mid single digit growth that we've enjoyed for several years, and there are a series of initiatives that really we're culminating in 2016 and the early part of this year that should make our performance in a growth area, internal organic growth, brighter in 2018 and beyond than it's been in the recent past. And the Medical segment, really in the last two years, is up $283 million in revenue. So, that has largely offset the sort of drag, about $265 million drag, we had out of Energy and Industrial, and especially when you exclude the Abel disposition.","Next slide. Here we would look at RF Technology. That segment will explode of course in 2017. You can see on the chart here, its book-to-bill was 1.10 in the fourth quarter. Organic orders were up 24%, a good deal of that was the New York City tunnel project, most of which got booked in the fourth quarter, and total orders are up 38%.","Organic revenue was up 8%. Growth in the toll and traffic applications was strong in the quarter, and, importantly, we had a faster start to the all-electronic tolling in the New York City bridge and tunnel program than we expected. We did about $15 million in the fourth quarter, and that leaves us, the total project is about $52 million for the installation and technology purchase. So it gives us maybe $37 million for the coming year. Then there is another $20 million in maintenance that lasts for like $5 million a year for four years to get us back to the $72 million number we were talking about. So excellent start to that. We had sort of middle single-digit organic growth in our Software businesses. Freight matching did a little better than that. CBORD had a particularly strong quarter, up double digits with security deployments for universities.","Aderant continued to lock in gain share in the large law office component. We completed the Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions, which really greatly expands our application software footprint and capabilities. It gives us some new platforms for growth in professional services. There are a lot of interesting things; end markets to explore and other things to bolt on to the business.","And if you look over at this revenue graph, you see it going from $904 million to $1.224 billion. We put this 2017 chart on there, we'd have to change the whole page, because we're going to do over $1.9 billion in RF & Software in 2017. So, in 2014, it was up $47 million, and in 2015, it was up $86 million. Last year, it was up $187 million. It'll be up $650 million to $700 million or more this year.","So we think we'll continue in 2017 with strong software growth, with really incredible cash performance out of this businesses. We'll continue to grow in toll and traffic projects, but a lot of this is trans-suite (17:35) software projects, which don't involve toll tax. So for the year, we should have nice growth out of completing the New York City project and the continuation of our Saudi project, but we're going to have fewer tag shipments and we've seen a fall-off in tags in 2016 related to railcars, which wouldn't surprise anybody and people tend to forget about it. But we have a tag on every railcar that gets produced.","Next line is our segment revenue is expected to grow about 60% with huge contributions from ConstructConnect and Deltek. Incrementally those people will probably add about $650 million of revenue this year versus last year when we got a little bit of contribution out of them in the fourth quarter. In total then, organic revenue ought to be sort of in the mid single-digits, but the big story is all the added growth that you see there.","Next slide. Next slide is just a page identifier that we're going to now talk about 2017 guidance. So we'll go to the next slide. In establishing the 2017 guidance, we've got an adjustment in terms of what we're adding to our adjusted numbers. A lot of people have asked us about this. We've sort of explained our view historically, and a increasing number of you think this is something we ought to do. We've given it a lot of thought. We've looked at a lot of information and do think it is a better way to report our earnings with taking the acquisition-related intangible amortization affecting it by tax and including it in the adjustment. So you'll see we didn't talk about that at all during the fourth quarter discussion, but we'll be talking about it from now on, as the way we'll report earnings and compare our performance against the prior year. There is additional information you'll see in our appendix that can help you with that.","Full year 2017 guidance then would be an adjusted earnings number of $8.82 to $9.22 a share. That represents about 20% to 22% revenue growth for the company in 2017, of which 3% to 5% would be organic. We're assuming a tax rate of about 30%, everybody has heard the conversations about how much somebody like Roper would be benefited if you had a change in business tax, but for our guidance we're going with 30%. Now, it's true that a very high percentage of our income is in the U.S., so we're as interested as any of the rest of you are on what's going to happen to tax rates in the U.S.","Operating cash flow is up 15% from last year. We're saying operating cash flow would come in at $1.150 billion, up from $1 billion last year. And our Q1 guidance is $1.92 to $2 a share, only an $0.08 spread in there, and the reason for that is, of course, we're into the quarter already, so we have a pretty good view about that.","For the full year, we've established a $0.40 variance at $8.82 to $9.22 with the midpoint of $9.02. You should know that, in the first quarter, Deltek was seasonally soft in the first quarter, just how their business is and then up dramatically in the second quarter and so they do have a little seasonality in the way the incoming renewals and new business gets generated.","If we look then to the next slide, we can kind of summarize kind of how the year wound up and how we're positioned for this current year. As we said, we had record results for orders and revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash. Really significant milestones.","In the fourth quarter, it's the first time we've ever had $1 billion in quarterly revenue and of course you can see from our guidance it's going to be more of the norm in the future. Of over $1.5 billion in backlog versus $1.07 billion the last year, so we're up about $508 million in backlog going into the year. We have $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first time. Now we look back at what we said at the beginning of last year, our guidance was, we can do about $1 billion and we actually did a little over $1 billion for the first time.","Really a transformational year for us on many levels. We invested $3.7 billion in software acquisitions this year after $1.8 billion the year before. And half of our EBITDA in 2017 is going to come from our Software and Network businesses and the other half from products, some of those are medical products.","We're looking for about 20% revenue growth in 2017. We have really broad based opportunities. It's a better situation for us as we enter 2017 because the macroeconomic drivers fit our businesses really well. That headwind that we've had to bite through over a $265 million dividend in the Energy is gone. And the end markets we see are much more optimistic and our business leaders were sort of 80% through our 2017 review process with the field and the optimism is pretty good, maybe even better than what we're willing to endorse yet.","We're going to continue to expand and compound our cash flow, and I think being up 15% cash flow in 2017 over 2016, and a business that's basically not cyclical anymore, is a pretty good achievement. So we've got great results and very, very strong exciting momentum as we go into 2017 and beyond.","And with that, Rob, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. And we'll go to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And thanks for moving to cash earnings. It's what all the rest of our companies do, so it just makes a little easier for everybody, for us at least. So thanks for that. I just kind of just curious to hear, Brian, your opinion on why you think orders came snapping back in the quarter to kind of when you think about Medical and Scientific Imaging? I mean is this a bit of a post \u2013 post election people are holding off on stuff and then it came through or is there some legitimate recovery views out there, I mean just kind of curious to see how you think about that?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I don't think it's anything related to post-election activity or people holding up because of where the orders are, right? So, you didn't have a negative dip in orders in Industrial or Energy, so that helps at the beginning, right?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","And then, you had an unusual situation with a large book boarded for (25:07) the tunnel project. If you took that out, then organic orders are more or like 6% or something like that...","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","...I think that the improvement in Medical was pretty good. The people think about the Sunquest lab business, but it's actually the Acute Care Software business and it's doing really well, it's just that the lab business has been on the laggard for the last two years organically even though it's continued to be improve, but the ancillary things around it are growing at double-digits. So, they are getting bigger and their growth is organic and it comes in and you see stronger support.","Same thing, we went through a little bit of a hiccup in MHA at the beginning of 2016, and we're constantly monitoring drug issues and pricing and what's happening with generics, and what's happening with the things we serve, which are not the big risk drug things. So, MHA is improving a bit, but the two software components that go into home health and alternate site treatment for people are performing exceptionally well. Again, these are sort of double-digit growers.","So, I think that's good and then we had \u2013 generally our CBORD business does really well in Q2, and that's most of the year, but it had pretty good Q4. There is a level of optimism. Throughout our reviews that we do each business, a year ago, people were really apprehensive and nervous and you don't get that from anybody. So, I think as Rob and myself, and John and Paul put these numbers together for the year, our governance model creates what you see in the way of guidance. Maybe there will be some better euphoria throughout the year, but we're not banking on it.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very fair. And then did Roper Pumps actually turn positive on orders year-over-year, or is it still year-over-year negative?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","It was down, I can tell you it was actually up 8% in revenue sequentially...","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","...in the fourth quarter over the third quarter, but the \u2013 not the orders, but the revenue, so...","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","(27:22) But no, Roper Pump is still negative on orders and revenue in the fourth quarter, but sequentially a little bit better, but year-over-year it's still a headwind.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, okay. Well, I've got follow-up to you guys afterwards, but thank you, and good luck.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","All right.","Operator","We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Brian, just on the deferred revenue. One, is that, I think I haven't seen it presented that way before in your working capital slide. Is that sort of a redefinition of the metric internally too, or are you just showing it differently to us? And is that going to be the main driver of the improvement in working capital from here, receivables and payables kind of reached a natural stopping point and the deferred revenue is going to be the driver from here, maybe just some thoughts on that?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. As far as the reporting convention, it's always been in our number. So this is not a change. We've decided to split it away from the payables and accruals line in order to show the increase in that deferred revenue side. I mean, look, there is always more opportunity on all these line items, right, whether it's receivables or inventory or payables. But I do think most of the future improvement will continue to be the growth that we see in software and we get paid in advance for that. And so that continues to build the deferred revenue balance. I anticipate that's where we'll see most of the incremental change. Of course the change in the first quarter will be substantial, because we'll be able to roll in a full quarter of deferred revenue for ConstructConnect and Deltek in addition to their revenue.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the Medical segment, you feel like that's getting to a point where it can now grow like 5% plus on a consistent basis, or is there \u2013 is the nature of kind of the Imaging business as well as some of the pieces of the Medical businesses, is it such that we're going to kind of average the mid single-digits, but we're going to go through these periods of low-singles and high-singles? Maybe just some thoughts around the steadiness or lack thereof of the whole segment in total.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Sure, Shannon. So really this is the 12th consecutive quarter that the Medical businesses have been up mid single-digits or better organically. So really the noise in the segment has been with the Imaging businesses. As we mentioned, this quarter the Imaging business is down, so the segment was only up 3%, but the core Medical businesses have been consistently mid-single-digit growers now for three years, and we certainly expect that to continue.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey. I'm just wondering on the Energy segment with I think some of (30:25) stronger than you expected probably and the orders were good. Is that proving a little earlier cycle than you might have expected, the sensitivity?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","No, I don't. All you can see is that the rate of decline improved. It was still down year-over-year except for those orders. So, I think we think it's going to be flat to low single-digit growth in 2017. But of the businesses we have that were involved in it, we really only see one of them that still has headwinds going into 2017, and that's our compressor control business which has \u2013 it has a lot of service content, but on the new applications, it still has to struggle quite a bit. And you had rig counts were up a little bit, so that you get a little bit of improvement at Roper Pump, but it's not \u2013 the materiality of Energy in 2017 is it won't be a headwind.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Sure. And then the corporate unallocated line looks like it had a lot of deal expenses in the first quarter. What's the outlook for that line for next year, and does the first quarter include some carryover from the heavy processes that you executed in the fourth quarter?","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I don't expect there would be any carryover. Remember, we did adjust out the substantial by acquisition expenses in the fourth quarter for both Deltek and ConstructConnect. And so what you see there as far as the variance on a year-over-year basis is, frankly, our stock price is higher, and so our equity compensation expense is higher as a result. We expect that to be somewhere in the range of $140 million, the total for the corporate G&A line, about $140 million for 2017, reflecting the increase in equity compensation primarily.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, you guys disappointed, you're missing all the fun snowstorm in the Northeast today?","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Terribly disappointed. We got four inches of sunshine this morning here in Florida. So...","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right.","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Sorry.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great job. Maybe we could talk about the first quarter. The guide looks a little bit light. Give us an update how the quarter is tracking versus the year organic, 3% to 5%, and is there anything unusual in timing? You called out Deltek seasonally weak. Is there anything else you'd highlight?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think that just because it is historically a little light in the first quarter, and now it's really strong in the second quarter, the rest of the year. So I think organic is, Q1 and Q4 would be 3% to 4%, and Q2 and Q3 would be 4% to 5% or 6% or something like that. So, for the year, we're like 3% to 5% with maybe a little hope for upside.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, it was interesting you called out that your mix today is 50% in software and network businesses. What do you see as the optimal mix for Roper over time?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think, our focus would be to continue to compound the cash, right. So, the more we can grow in software and network businesses, the happier we are, because they just inherently are going to throw off more cash that we can reinvest for further compounding in the future than the products businesses. But our products businesses are about half of the EBITDA. Now a chunk of that, a notable chunk of that, is our medical products businesses. And then you've got the instrumentation businesses and you've got the oil and gas related stuff.","We may enjoy a little bit of a cyclical spike on oil and gas, but it won't materially affect the balance of the company's EBITDA profile. Our businesses, as I said, you just look at the OP alone in the fourth quarter between Energy and Industrial is 30.5%. So we love the businesses. They are positive cash. They don't have much amortization in them, but moving the needle on compounding cash will come from software and networks.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And just one last clarification. I know you're not factoring in any of the potential changes in corporate tax. But for your medical products, are you considering any uncertainty in terms of ordering with uncertainty around the repeal or changes in the Affordable Care Act in terms of the outlook for 2017?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I'll let Neil comment on that one.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning, Deane. So the short answer is, we're not expecting much headwind at all, just like we didn't expect much tailwind when it came in. Majority of what we do is not procedure or patient driven. It's more elements that help the totality of the healthcare system do what they do. And so we have a lot of things that were consumed in a procedure than we would have been benefited and might have some headwinds, but that's not the nature of what we do.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On albeit the Trump stuff, I'm sure you guys have done a little bit of analysis. You got, obviously, had kind of a bunch of different subsidiaries that kind of roll up into the total. So it's hard for us to tell, but you do have a lot of U.S. related revenue. So what kind of impact would it have on your tax rate, if you did have kind of a lowering to that 15% to 20% range? And then, I think exports are like 13%ish of your revenues. Is there a material import component that offsets that? It's the first question.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So let's deal with the border tax side first. There is not much. There we do have some assembly operations in Mexico that we get subcomponents from, for one, two of our businesses. But it's not a lot. Most of our international businesses are selling globally and our domestic businesses don't export. I mean, they're really not domestic business, they're global businesses. The locus might be here in the U.S., but they have manufacturing operations outside the U.S. So and then \u2013 and they could ship for many of them. So I don't think the border tax would be a lot. We did sort of a back of the napkin kind of assessment about that would be. Probably 75% to 80% of our operating profit will be generated in the United States. So, if we're telling you about 30% blended tax rate, the U.S. tax rate of course is 35% and above, so you can kind of do the math on our net earnings number and look at 80% of it and then take a 20% reduction of that or a 10% reduction or whatever you think and then add back the increased cost of the border tax and net-net it would be quite a material increase in our cash.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right, right.","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","And some of that (38:11) Steve, of course, there is no proposal yet.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah.","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Right. So..","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. There is a lots of...","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","As soon as we see a proposal, we can give you a much better answer, but the elements of exactly whatever tax change all this is headlines in the newspaper so far.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, and Twitter feeds or whatever, your handles or whatever you call them. On the infrastructure side kind of same question, I guess sort of the same topic. Assuming \u2013 if they do something, I would assume that the kind of the tolling business would perhaps be exposed there with any other businesses there, they will be positively exposed to any of this infrastructure discussion that's out there. Again, there is no official proposal, but assuming they do spend on some of the roads and bridges and things like that.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think that all of our professional services businesses, including these last two acquisitions; ConstructConnect...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right, right.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","...and Deltek could be dramatically benefited by the number of seats and the number of users that would want to get access to those technologies, particularly at Deltek with the Costpoint technology, which is ubiquitous for people that supply the government and that would be very helpful.","In the tolling area, it's interesting. There is actually \u2013 we've gone through this huge technology transformation to our sticker tags away from what other people get stuck with with the plastic box from Austria. And that had a huge roll out in all of the big tolling stage. And so that's sort of behind us, that roll out, so you just have the maintenance, the maintenance is huge. The number of reorders, we're always amazed where will all these tags go. So it's good, but the project growth in infrastructure could well be in our trans-suite software and traffic management arena, that's really what the Saudi project is. And the electronic tolling project in New York, for instance, doesn't have \u2013 it's all electronic, so there is no tags on it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So it would definitely help us, particularly in revenue, probably not help us as much as it would have historically in the margin where people are also using the tags, but that's \u2013 it would be favorable to us. And then I think if you get \u2013 you got the various elements that appear to be going through that would get us back into production around shale, we came down to $165 million in two years in Energy and Industrial. We won't go back up to $165 million, but we won't be going down, we might go up more than we think. So that's a little bit of a question mark for us.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. One more question just on the first quarter following up to Deane's question. The 3% to 4% organic is solid. I guess their earnings number is a little bit below what I would have expected. So is there anything that kind of that you travel from the top-line to the bottom-line, whether it's acquisition charges that you know maybe people won't have in their models or mix dynamics. And anything there, corporate, that we have to keep in mind for the first quarter that stands out?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think you just have the situation around, we got all the interest cost in Q1 for Deltek and its contribution doesn't come in as much until Q2 and beyond.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So it's kind of tiny, right? But, in reality, first quarter guidance is about 22% of the full year guidance, and that's not that unusual. You would be aware that Q1 was 25% of the full year, right.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So I think it's just an out of the box situation. And Q2 will be incredible for us.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Okay. Well, it's helpful, you guys give, a lot of companies don't give the quarterly guidance. So it's helpful to level set people and get everybody on the same page. So I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Robert.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Obviously, you've just completed two very large deals, transformative debatably and you are digesting that. But maybe can you just talk about, maybe over the next three years to four years, what is your M&A outlook fire power? How are you thinking about it? How we should be thinking about it? Because, as you know, money never sleeps. And so, as good as what you've just done over the last four months, and the changes you've made to your reporting structure, clearly, investors remain focused on the continued compound nature of the company.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So the \u2013 a few years ago, people would remember, I said we already know the next $5 billion we want to deploy, it's just a question of when it happens. So we've done that all and we've (43:28) really got these things. The good news is we still know where the next $5 billion deployment needs to be and they are, and when they are ready to be assimilated. So, I think over the \u2013 if you look at 2017, 2018 and 2019, I would think we deploy about $4 billion, just not much of it in 2017, where we want to pay back existing debt to EBITDA unless there is some other source of cash that comes up that we haven't talked about. We're looking to pay down that debt level by $700 million or more, and that still gives us room for bolt-on for this year and then much larger acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 and the compounded cash is coming up and we self-generated the ability to do $1.5 billion a year. We just want to get our debt holders comfortable as this year unfolds.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Now, as you look at it, and this is a question that might be a little bit more for broader application than Roper. But, Brian, since you've been doing deals for a very long time and you historically worked at companies which maybe you had higher fixed cost assets and drove a lot of value through cost takeout. How do you look at the environment right now? If you're an acquirer and it's unclear given border adjustability and other issues, how you're going to get the cost synergies to kind of de-lever what could be ostensibly a high multiple, lower multiples? Now that's not your game anymore I understand, but I wanted to just get your view, do you think it creates a tougher cloud to your M&A environment for the standard acquirer, strategic acquirer in the Industrial space or how would you look at the M&A environment as being kind of from your perch?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, fortunately...","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","We look at it differently than hypothesis therein from our perch. If we look at M&A just sort of as a category of activity, the big question is, is interest going to be deductible in some kind of change in U.S. tax. So, if interest isn't going to be deductible, you can imagine what are the effects that has on private equity as we're thinking about what sort of multiples are going to put to work.","So, if you're accustomed to putting seven times and eight times debt-to-EBITDA and getting a tax deduction for that, that gives you massive ability to compete with strategics. If you lose the interest deduction, your ability to compete with strategics goes down. If you remove one of the biggest acquirer of entities from the market, the strategics should have a field day. Now, that said, most of the multi industry people have very complicated import\/export arrangement.","So, I would imagine that they got a lot of issues with the border tax, painfully we don't. I think the M&A environment for us, as interest rates go up irrespective of whether you can deduct the interest, as interest rates go up, we're in a better position with each passing month that occurs because we have so much self-generated free cash flow. And if we do acquisitions with our own cash flow and lever of about three times debt-to-EBITDA, which is our model, we wind up with purchase powder requiring very little, if any, new debt of about $1.5 billion a year. And that's why I'm very comfortable saying I think over the next three years or a month or two beyond that we'll deploy $4 billion as it's easy for us. We're going to do it in acquiring things that are going to compound their cash. And so we keep getting more cash to reinvest as opposed to having to do big debt structures. So that'd be my best answer.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the color. Appreciate it very much.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","We'll go to Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, how are you doing?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Going back to TransCore, just curious, obviously, in the infrastructure package from the federal government be positive, but what are you seeing out there just in terms of things that have passed that like the state and local level already, and there is some big packages in California, Washington state looks like California DOT is set to increase their budget if they get their legislation passed. So, just curious what that forward kind of outlook is there as well?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","There is a lot of bid activity and there is a lot of sweat equity that goes into things. I mean we sell the Title 21 tags into California. I mean, I mean I would do (48:01) the Bay Bridge. We had various other traffic projects that are currently under quote. But I wouldn't say that we have seen \u2013 we've seen a big increase in the last two years in terms of quotations and project opportunities. But we haven't seen something in the last two months that \u2013 it's a big deal. I think that we'd want to be careful that, if you look at total transportation spending, the tolling and traffic side is not a big percentage of that total, right. But nonetheless, if it goes up, there is more money available, we'll get more growth than we have now.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then, shifting over to Neptune, we haven't really spoken much about that. What kind of \u2013 what do you see in commentary on just the muni sector in general and levels of spending there? I think there has been a little bit of a mix signal so far from people in that space across the last couple months. So just curious what you're seeing there.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, we haven't seen any fall-off at all in Neptune. It's probably going to grow at mid single-digits in 2017, and it continues to have good cash performance. So there's a little bit of headwind for people that don't, aren't vertically integrated like we are around copper pricing. So, I think our competitors'll probably struggle more than we will. We're in good shape.","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","(49:27) that water utilities are generally self-contained, in terms of, they charge for water. And they use that revenue in order to basically maintain the system. And so, it's generally not been subject to the larger swings and municipal budget spending, it's generally its own little P&L inside the municipal world.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Absolutely. And just last one for me on M&A. You said that you already know, laid out the map of where you want to spend your next $5 billion, it's just a question of when they pop free. Now, given like where you guys are right now financially, if one of those larger ones was to pop free soon, would the leverage today preclude you from doing something like that, or would you consider equity if it was something sooner?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I think that would just always be related to the quality of what it was that we saw. And the things that we are sort of hoping to acquire over the next three years, none of them are available today at noon, so it's not in a situation that we have to really be bothered with. But, we continue to monitor everything and have routine conversations. If you get the share price up here to what it's really worth given all this cash, a consideration, I suppose, but I wouldn't issue equity today.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Brian, when you look at the current portfolio of businesses at Roper, how do you think about core incremental margins on the current businesses? I would think with as much software as you have, the core incremental must be \u2013 is it 45%-ish? And then it strikes me that given the Energy business is on a bounce, now, again we're not expecting that in 2017, but I remember the decrementals there have been reasonably high. So, would you look at the current business and kind of step up into that core incremental EBIT potential of 45%, and is that a fair assumption here?","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, I think the way to think about this is it depends on where it comes from, Rick. I mean, you're absolutely right. To the extent that we have more growth from the software businesses, that will come in at 50%, maybe even above that. Across the enterprise, I think what you will see is that we'll have somewhere between 35% and 50% to 55% incrementals depending on where it comes from. And I would say that the decrementals that we saw on the Energy side, they may be (52:28) high relative to others, but they were actually low relative to our gross margin, right. So, we still de-levered at a rate below our gross margins. (52:38) We're able to take the cost out ahead of just what the decline in revenue would have resulted in. Thus, we think that we did a nice job, I think our businesses did a nice job on the decremental side there. Even though it's a probably higher number than most other companies, but that's a margin discussion rather than a (52:57) discussion.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","But that's \u2013 maybe that's the point, that obviously taking the cost out on the way down, kind of managing the decremental does potentially give you more upside as you lever off of that cost base. Is pricing \u2013 and again, I would think in the current portfolio, do you have a price capture number for 2016 and has that...","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","No.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Has your pricing flexibility, though, improved with this portfolio as well?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","No. We don't have standard products, right? We're an application oriented company, so you don't call up and order the same thing you bought last year. You might have recurring revenue, there may be some built-in maintenance fees associated with batter and SaaS. There may be some annual escalation. But, we're not a product company with standard products. Even the products that we have are pretty unique products and so they don't tend to have a standard price list that people can work off of. There is a few exceptions to that, but not many.","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","And the other thing that with \u2013 and what we do look up with respect to price is really what's the value capture that we're able to get inside the niche markets and applications that we have. If you just look at the Industrial Technology segment by itself, the gross profit margin I think is the thing to look at when you think about value and price and cost and things like that. And our Industrial Technology business is actually a 50.6% gross margin in 2016, up 80 basis points from where it was in 2015. Energy Systems & Controls still clicking along at 57% gross profit margin.","So, I mean folks who try to say price as a discrete measure, just follow their gross margin and see if any of that price really shows up there, that's how we think about it rather than having standard price list and what a nominal price change might be advertised at. The proof is in the gross profit margin.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, John, just one last question. As we move forward into 2017 here with really more of a cash earnings number, is it the intent to report EBITA by segment or will we continue to report a GAAP profit by segment and then add the amortization kind of consolidated?","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I think what you'll see us do is move to a segment profit description, which would add back the non-cash purchase accounting related amortization in order to be able to have the same comparability for all the same reasons at the total.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to John Quealy with Canaccord.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question on Deltek. In that, RF & Software guidance, would Deltek be right in line with that mid single-digit organic growth or perhaps are they a little bit more in the cash flow side, so perhaps a little bit less organic growth, but better cash flow margins vis-\u00e0-vis its peers in that segment?","John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. So, of course, Deltek is not included in our organic results or forecast for 2017, that will all be acquisition-related. On an apples-to-apples basis, for sure we have to take what their prior results were in the \u2013 with a little bit of grayness of salt. But, we expect that we are a mid single-digit grower. I think they're reporting something a little bit higher than that, but we expect mid single-digit organic growth on a long-term basis out of that acquisition.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, quickly, lastly much more speculative question, but if the tax structure changes, and I know you guys are loathed to sell major assets, given low tax basis. But, would you consider given the right tax regime, letting go some bigger assets perhaps on the fixed cost side? I'm thinking Neptune, for example, as a core asset given the market seems to be giving these types of water companies good multiples. Would you consider selling a bigger asset if the cash return would look more promising? Thanks, guys.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","No. We'd expect the market is smart enough, we believe it is to get the value for us \u2013 for Neptune being worth more than any of the other water companies, it's imputed in our price. There could be other businesses we have that are different. Neptune is very different. We're going to move that increasingly into technology and all kinds of exciting things going on there, which we're not going to talk about openly until it's too late for people to respond.","But, I will say, when you look at some of the deeper product businesses, the legacy product businesses or some of the instrumentation businesses, you can see something happen there, but people would have to basically pay our tax. So, if the tax burden goes down to the acquirer then, hey, maybe there are more areas, I don't know.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Robert Crisci for closing remarks.","Rob Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, thank you again everyone for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you in a few months.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"19065":["Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call February  2, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Brian Jellison - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer","Robert Crisci - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Neil Hunn - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer","Zack Moxcey - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Robert McCarthy - Stifel","Joe Giordano - Cowen","Unknown Analyst - JP Morgan","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Richard Eastman - Baird","Operator","Welcome to the Roper Technologies Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results conference call. We\u2019ll now begin. Please note today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President, Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. ","Earlier this morning we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC\u2019s filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information.","Now please turn to Slide 3. Today we will discuss our results for the fourth quarter and year primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is on our press release and also included as part of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pre-tax basis: a $215 million one-time net gain resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; a $73 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and lastly an $8 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions and $1 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commissions that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition.","Now if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 4, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, Zack, and good morning everybody. We have four categories here - we\u2019ll look at the Q4 and full-year 2017 financial results, and we\u2019ll look at the 2017 segment detail and how it sets us up for our 2018 segment outlook. You\u2019ll see throughout the discussion, once we get into the segments, that the segments have really changed pretty dramatically over the last several years. They\u2019ve become much more diverse, which creates some opportunity for us that we\u2019re going to try to exploit here shortly. In 2018, we\u2019ll show you the enterprise guidance for the year and then take your questions.","Next slide. If we look at the quarter, it really was a terrific quarter. We had record results on revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow, cash conversion was spectacular, revenue was up 21%. We had organic 5% growth in the fourth quarter, which was similar to what we enjoyed throughout the year and what we\u2019re likely to see next year as well. Gross margin was up 30 basis points in the quarter to 62.6%. This is keeping us comfortably ahead of any cost push inflation. There certainly is some of that, that you can see, but we think we have that well in hand. ","Our debts were up 23% to 270, and I\u2019m sure this will be one of those quarters that will be fascinating to read the headlines because good old GAAP, of course, incorporates the $215 million tax benefit one-time for the fourth quarter, so in GAAP we did 427. As always, we like the adjusted earnings because it paints a much more clear picture, and in fact we did 270 on adjusted earnings.","EBITDA was up 21% to $441 million in the quarter. Our operating cash flow was remarkable - it was up 36%. We did $369 million of operating cash flow on revenue of $1.230 billion. ","Deltek and ConstructConnect had great fourth quarters but actually for the full year beat all of our revenue and cash flow assumptions. During the full year, we reduced $1.06 billion of debt, even though we did a couple of small deals, so that deleveraging, you\u2019ll see how much that benefits us shortly.","Next slide. Our Q4 income statement, here you can see the nominal numbers that are available for all of you. Importantly, the tax rate, you can see in the fourth quarter was 26.9%. Generally I think we were guiding around 29%, maybe a little less in the fourth quarter, so we got a slight benefit out of tax. Net earnings were $280 million.","Next slide. Here, we have all four of the segments for the fourth quarter on one slide here in terms of the numerical impact. You can see it was truly a terrific quarter, and most importantly it supports a really good start into 2018. In the RF segment, it was up organically 4% if we exclude toll and traffic, which always has some lumpy characteristics, so it is down 1% organically but it\u2019s of no consequence. The acquisitions of course drove all of the terrific benefits, so revenue was up 45%, EBITDA was up 47%. I think some people missed the fact there was a stub period for Deltek and ConstructConnect in the fourth quarter last year - it\u2019s important to understand that. We treated all of the revenue and income as acquisition-related, even though we could have called some of this organic.","On the medical side, you\u2019ll see where revenue was up 4%, EBITDA was flat. We\u2019ll talk a little bit about why that is and why that might continue for another few quarters, but energy and industrial of course had just spectacular results and unbelievable leverage. Energy was up 12% in revenue and up 11% in EBITDA, 9% organic growth. Industrial had 14% organic growth and was up a total 16%, so it was a really terrific quarter.","Next slide. As we shift now to a discussion about the full year, which helps position us when we think about what our guidance is for \u201918, here you can see for the full year we had organic growth of 5%. We were up 23 on revenue. Gross profit was up 90 basis points. You know, when you\u2019re running at 61.7 in \u201916, to be able to add 90 basis points of gross profit just says a ton about the quality of the management inside our company. Net earnings, you can see are up dramatically here, and the $975 million in net earnings of course doesn\u2019t deal with how much better cash conversion we have, and we\u2019ll talk about that. ","Tax rate for the year was 28.9%. We expected it to be somewhere around 30. With the new tax reform as we talk about it later, we\u2019ll probably pick up 7%, maybe 8% lower tax rate for 2018. ","Next slide. For the full year, and it really is a remarkable year, we were up $860 million on revenue from $3.8 billion to $4.665 billion, so we continue to inch closer to a $5 billion revenue threshold. EBITDA was up $290 million and operating cash flow after last year for the first time in history just getting over a billion dollars. We added $233 million to that this year to bring it up to $1.234 billion. ","Next slide. On compounding our cash flow here at cash conversion, you can see on Slide 10 that our free cash flow closed out the year at $1.175 billion, up 22% from last year\u2019s $961 billion, so cash clearly remains the best measure of performance in a world of adjusted commentary. So the cash is pretty clear - it was $200 million more than our net earnings. ","Our full-year operating cash flow was 26% of revenue. Our free cash flow was 25% of revenue. That gave us a free cash flow conversion of 121% - of course, on a GAAP basis it\u2019s dramatically higher, and then we reduced our debt by $1.06 billion, so that deleveraging you\u2019ll see in a second is pretty powerful.","Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues to just plug along, so we closed the year for the first time in our history with a negative working capital number. You can see on this slide that year-end \u201915, we had 4.3% net working capital, and then in \u201916 it was down to 2.7%. This year, it\u2019s a negative number - 3.3%. I always like to look back and see how we\u2019re doing relative to five and 10 years ago. Five years ago, not a long time, December \u201912 we were at--inventory was 5.9% of our revenue annualized, and now it\u2019s 4.2%; receivables were 18.5%, and now they\u2019re 16%; payables were 11.6% and now they\u2019re 12%; deferred revenue was 5.7% and now it\u2019s 11.4%, and when you add those columns together, you go from 7% net working capital in 2012, push forward five years and we\u2019re at a negative 3.3%. You know, 10% of our revenue would be about $500 million that we do not have to have tied up in any way in these net working capitals, so really as we grow now, growth becomes a source of cash instead of a use of cash. At deferred revenue, you can see we closed the year out at $566 million.","By the way, if I look back 10 years ago at the end of \u201907, our net working capital number when we started this process was 13% versus 3.3% now.","Next slide. Wow, the balance sheet should be glowing neon for you. You can see cash is $671 million, and finally that cash number, really when you look at net debt to EBITDA means something because that cash is no longer trapped outside the United States. We look at paying down a billion dollars of debt, so gross debt went from $6.2 billion to $5.156 billion. If we didn\u2019t do any deals this year and paid down another billion, it\u2019d be down to $4 billion, and you know the EBITDA is going to be higher than what you\u2019ve got - we\u2019d be at a two times debt to EBITDA, so you can be assured we\u2019re going to be doing deals.","Our net debt number at 4.4 divided by our already reported trailing EBITDA gives you a 2.8 debt to EBITDA number before we get any new cash this year, and that compares to our close-out in \u201916 of 4.1. I doubt many people could do the kind of cash flow we do and maintain the discipline to drop in a one-year period from over 4 times debt to EBITDA to less than 3. It\u2019s really great performance from all of our leaders. ","Next slide. Tax reform is just a marvelous thing for us. It benefits us in many, many ways. First, our tax rate is likely to come in around 21 to 23% for \u201918, and this gives us more earnings and more cash flow. We\u2019re going to be able to repatriate over $500 million rather quickly from our offshore cash, and that really adds to our acquisition capacity immediately. The mobility of worldwide cash is a huge benefit because in the past, 20 to 25% of our earnings and cash flow were coming from outside the U.S. from our great businesses there, but they tended to put pressure on you to invest in other non-U.S. areas. Now, we no longer have that constraint and we can deploy capital wherever we want to.","The way I look at this is really you have the lower tax rate, higher cash flow, and then access to global cash is a perfect trifecta for Roper. We couldn\u2019t ask for more, and I guarantee we\u2019ll use it well.","Next slide. Before we get into the segment detail, I want to tell you a couple of things we\u2019re doing here to kind of facilitate some things around the segments. First, our segments have really changed significantly, and you\u2019ll see that as I talk about the four current reporting segments. Those changes have created some structural oddities for us about who reports to whom and how did these things get done, and there are some opportunities for us to do a better job in cleaning this up going forward.","This is really the optimum time for us to take a look at how we\u2019re structured, so one of the things that we\u2019re going to do to accommodate that is to appoint Neil Hunn effective today as not only Executive Vice President but our Chief Operating Officer. That\u2019s going to help us with a process Neil and I have been working on about how we think we might want to look at realigning these segments, and while certainly it says a lot about Neil and our long-term succession, this is less about our succession and a whole lot more about getting the company structured so it\u2019s less opaque and easier for us to talk to investors about our growth over the next three years.","Next slide. On the RF technology and software segment, here you can see this is such a screaming example of why we need to do some things. This segment has been dominated by toll and traffic for years - it was always over half of the revenue. Today with the Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions, project management, application software, the products that we have, that\u2019s over 75% of our total segment now, and the toll and traffic business is only about 25%. While it will grow, it will continue to wither away in terms of its contribution to the segment.","We spent a very substantial amount of time in the fourth quarter of this year doing very extensive three-year strategic plan reviews with all the people in this segment, and they have widely diverse end markets, as you can see. If you look over here for \u201917, Deltek and ConstructConnect exceeded what we expected on revenue and cash flow. Deltek had great balance across their govcon business and professional services, and a little acquisition we did called Onvia is going to strengthen their market intelligence subscription platform and is off to a good start in that respect.","ConstructConnect\u2019s network grew dramatically and it\u2019s going to continue to drive recurring revenue growth. We had about 5% organic growth across all the software segments, with Freight Match and Aderant being the leaders in that.","Our RF products, which is RF IDeas and Ivonics Technolog, also had positive growth. Toll and traffic, on the other hand, while they had great project execution on the MTA project in New York and Saudi, we had very low tag shipments in the first quarter of the year, and it improved throughout the year but still wound up being just pretty modest in terms of what it contributed for the year. As we look at 2018, Deltek, which will be totally organic in 2018, and ConstructConnect will certainly help our numbers in this area. We think that the software businesses ought to grow 5 to 6%, and they come in with very strong margin and cash performance. The RF products are sort of similar or a little less in gross margins, but quite good EBITDA performance and they\u2019re growing pretty quickly.","On the toll and traffic situation, we think that\u2019s likely to be flat in 2018, although the pipeline for opportunities is the most robust it\u2019s ever been, just that the timing is difficult to forecast. Lastly, you\u2019ll continue to see acquisitions in both the application software side and the project management software side in various niches. I would imagine we\u2019ll add to both of our large platforms here and you\u2019ll see some new niches that come in application software.","Next slide. If we look at the medical and scientific imaging, here again you\u2019ll see some sector things that not everything fits together perfectly. On the medical side, we have a medical products business that\u2019s the largest business we have in this segment, and that\u2019s in terms of revenues led by Verathon, in terms of growth as led by Northern Digital and CIVCO. A very successful product launch late in fourth quarter on what\u2019s called GlideScope Go, which is a portable product, and then a new BladderScan product, so we expect very strong second half of the year performance out of these launches. ","Our alternate site healthcare business had another good year, broad-based growth in the long-term GPO segment, and then our software businesses that support that. Our acute care software business, which is a family of independent businesses wrapped together here around the hospital software arena, had very strong growth from our decision support SaaS business, which is Strata. The diagnostic connectivity business, which is Data Innovation and International Solutions, we won a very significant Queensland project for Sunquest International Lab business. The good news about that is it\u2019s going to be somewhere between AUD$50 million and AUD$100 million over the next several years; the bad news is this year it\u2019s going to require mostly upfront investment as we prepare to launch all of those things.","The U.S. lab business continues to be challenged. It\u2019s really been challenged now for two years, and we\u2019ve introduced some new products and the good thing is the new products are being picked up--they\u2019re getting picked up as upgrades, and we\u2019re not having success in new suites being applied to the U.S. lab business. So as we\u2019ve looked a great deal about that and spent--actually had a board meeting out there in September, had a really deep dive and things--you know, what we think is that U.S. lab business, which is a high margin business, will probably decline sort of mid single digits for another two years before rebounding.","In the scientific imaging business, we\u2019ve had sort of a breakthrough. Fourth quarter was just beyond spectacular in orders for our cryo-EM products, and that\u2019s going to carry over very, very impactfully in 2018.","If we look at the right-hand side for \u201918, you can see we\u2019re forecasting 4 to 6% organic revenue growth for the segment, and we might do even better than that; but the margins will probably come down 100 basis points, and I want to point out that the margin for \u201917 was far and away--it\u2019s the highest margin segment. It was just under 43%, and we think in \u201918 it\u2019s going to be between 41 and 42%. Really, everything in here is doing fine, it\u2019s just the drag for another year or two on the U.S. lab business with high margin contribution sort of gives us less than wonderful looking leverage, but we\u2019ll be up both in revenue and EBITDA in this segment in 2018.","Medical products and alternate sites are going to continue to have broad-based growth in \u201918, and certainly Strata and our international business growth is going to be robust, and then it gets offset a little bit by the U.S. lab business. Imaging will be strong because Gatan has record backlog and solid delivery projects for Q2 and Q3.","Next slide. On the industrial technology area, you can see the performance is--wow, if that\u2019s all you had, what an unbelievable thing. Record year for Neptune - they continue to gain market share despite what you might hear from others. Excellent growth from our fluid handling businesses. We certainly had a rebound at our Roper pump business around upstream oil and gas, tremendous performance out at Cornell Pump with a lot of rental markets for dewatering activity. Operating leverage in this segment was above 40%. We expect to have 5 to 7% organic growth in 2018, and there are some people who think it might be even better.","On the energy side, again a great story - over 50% operating leverage from nimble execution with our leaders. We had broad-based growth throughout the segment, and frankly CCC\u2019s declines were more modest than we might have expected. Again, probably 5 to 7% organic growth in 2018, very strong leverage. There is just nothing you can say but good things about both of these segments.","Next slide. As we look at 2018 guidance - next slide, we establish guidance for the year at $10.88 a share on the low end to $11.20 on the high end. That gives us organic revenue growth of 4 to 5%, maybe a little more. Tax rate is a little hard to plug in there - you know, use 22, you\u2019re probably relatively safe, but it could be down to 21, could be up a little higher. In the first quarter, we establish guidance of 244 to 250. We\u2019ll have a little bit lower tax rate in Q1 than we will for the rest of the year, so tax rate in the first quarter will certainly be less than 20% and then throughout the rest of the year it will bring us up to this 21 to 23% average.","Next slide. In terms of a summary around \u201917 and looking forward to \u201918, certainly our asset-light niche market strategy continues to deliver outstanding performance, greater than 20% growth in all of these categories - revenue, earnings, EBITDA, and cash flow. What was also encouraging is the consistency and broad-based organic growth that we had, and we see that continuing into \u201918. Deltek and ConstructConnect exceeded our expectations for the year - I think they had about $35 million in Q416 stub revenue that you might want to go back and see, so they really did well. Our ability to compound cash has dramatically changed. With the billion debt pay down, the balance sheet is pristine once again. Tax reform is just going to continue to compound more cash flow and an ability of us to deploy capital, and the net working capital is now a source of cash, so it\u2019s pretty unusual to have a growth strategy in which you don\u2019t have to invest to capture the opportunity.","The CRI disciplines that we use in capital deployment you can assure will continue to be deployed, and as we told you the last time, we thought we\u2019d probably do around $6 billion over the next four years or so, but in reality we\u2019ll be upping that because we\u2019re going to get at least a $250 million annual benefit in terms of how we can leverage the company with tax reform. So we\u2019re now thinking we\u2019ll do $7 billion or more over the next four-year period, hard to predict exactly when those numbers come to pass. Certainly we don\u2019t budget a particular number for a year, but we would expect to be above $7 billion when we look back four years from now, and Neil and I have maybe done a little work on getting these structures a little easier to manage, so I\u2019m looking forward to that.","It was a truly remarkable year and we entered 2018 with terrific momentum. With that, we\u2019d like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll take our first question from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. ","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning everyone. ","Brian Jellison","Hey, good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","Congrats to Neil in his new role at COO. First question, maybe take us through the dynamics in the fourth quarter in RF technology - it came in lighter both top line and earnings versus our expectations. I know there were some puts and takes in the quarter and you had called out last quarter there was some pull-in into the third quarter for Deltek - I don\u2019t know if that was a factor, or if this was that stub from a year ago. But could you take us through that for starters, please?","Brian Jellison","Rob is chomping at the bit.","Robert Crisci","Hi Deane, good morning. Yes, so it was right in line with our model on EBITDA. We actually were a little bit above our internal guidance model on EBITDA for the segment. We were a little light on revenue - I think we guided to low single digits and it came in minus-1, just because of the difficult MTA comp versus last year and timing on some of the TransCore projects. But it really was in line with our model, so I think, not to speak for the analysts, but it seems like the analysts may have missed the fact that we did have this $35 million or so of revenue last year, and it seems like people weren\u2019t taking that into account when they were doing their RF estimate for Q4. So from our perspective, in line, and more importantly really exceeded in terms of cash flow. The cash flow performance in the quarter was better than we expected, again driven by the new acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, and really good performance there. So from our viewpoint, it was a solid quarter in RF.","Brian Jellison","I just want to reassert that Deltek and ConstructConnect outperformed in the fourth quarter versus our model. It solely centers on the intelligent traffic system side of project management at TransCore.","Deane Dray","Got it, and then how about just the--expand more on the tax reform impact. Rob, can you just kind of take us through the details of how you work through the implications for Roper\u2019s tax position for 2018 and beyond? What swings you from 21 to 23 - we had been modeling 23, and what might be the dynamic in the first quarter that would be taking you lower than that?","Robert Crisci","Yes, sure. So like every other company out there, there was a lot of work done, and I commend our tax department - they\u2019ve been working long hours all the month of January to really get all this work done in time for the earnings call and, of course, the 10-K coming up. So yes, I think as Brian mentioned, we\u2019re probably--we had to give a point estimate, it\u2019s probably around 22% is our long-term, right? We wanted to give a range because there are some moving parts, and so it\u2019s always difficult when you\u2019re under a new law here to make sure you get everything ironed out, but I think that we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that 22% number over the long term.","As far as Q1, there are some discrete items, particularly around the deductions for compensation that would drive Q1 a little lower, as Brian mentioned probably a little under 20%. But you know, on a full-year long term, certainly if you want to put 22 in the model, it\u2019s probably a fine number.","Deane Dray","Got it. Then if I can sneak one more question in, maybe hear from Neil, just broad brush - you may be early in the process, but what might we be seeing in the way of a re-segmentation? It sounds like that\u2019s one of the first orders of business for you.","Brian Jellison","I\u2019ll give him a second to respond, but the thing is that most of the businesses report to either Neil or myself, so if you look at the way we\u2019re structured in RF, one of our key leaders is Tracy Marks that\u2019s over the ITS business. Another really key leader is Mike Corkery, who is over Deltek. It\u2019s our largest business. If you put the two largest revenue businesses really are the TransCore piece and the Deltek piece, they have, as you might guess, absolutely nothing to do with each other, so we have got this segment and there is a whole lot of other things that are a products piece, some of those report to Paul Soni, others report to Claude Pumilia, and what we\u2019ve found over the last year is we\u2019ve done some pretty significant talent upgrades, because as we\u2019re interviewing people, shockingly most people would like to know who they\u2019re going to report to and which businesses they have responsibility for, and we would be embarrassed if--you know, when we try to explain how the labyrinth works. So I\u2019d like to have some time here with Neil looking at how I\u2019ve kind of viewed the company since 2016. You know, we have products that are divided really into a couple of large categories, and those subcategories are precision technology, fluid handling, medical products and RF products.","On the other side, we have our software businesses, and they really have kind of four subcategories. You have our healthcare software business, you have our alternate site business, you have our application software business, and you have our project management business. We\u2019ve tried to maintain the same segment reporting for probably a little longer than we should. This won\u2019t really have an effect on how the 50 P&Ls in the company work, but it will have an effect on how Neil and I are looking at forward structure and long-term executive leadership positions. ","So inside that, then, it\u2019s all yours.","Neil Hunn","Yes, the only thing I would add, Deane, is this is about how we organize ourselves, not how we operate the businesses. I\u2019d just leave it there and look forward to unveiling more of that as Brian and I work through it in the next few quarters. ","Deane Dray","Great, thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks, good morning. Good to see the free cash flow conversion remains best in class after the switch to adjusted net income. Relative to the 121% this year, is that a good proxy for how the cash flow versus the A&I is structured?","Robert Crisci","Yes, so I would say long term, excellent year in 2017. If I had to give you a 2018, we\u2019d probably be 120% conversation on OCF, maybe 115% on free cash flow is sort of a framework. I think the 2017 performance was exceptional and we might be able to do that again, but we\u2019ll certainly always be running at 120% OCF conversion to the new adjusted net earnings, so I\u2019m always trying to clarify. We don\u2019t really report cash EPS, we reported adjusted EPS, and our cash is quite a bit higher than that.","Christopher Glynn","Right, great. Thanks Rob. Brian, since you brought it up, even though you downplayed it, how would you comment on the timeline around ultimate succession?","Brian Jellison","Who knows, three to five years? I think--I have an obligation to notify the board two years in advance, and I haven\u2019t done it, so this is not about succession. What this is, is an opportunity for Neil, who\u2019s worked at a yeoman way with everybody on our strategic planning process, where he and I just spend much more time together as we\u2019re developing what we\u2019re doing, so I used to--I think we were, like, 78, and I think the board was recently upping the retirement age to 80, so I\u2019ll be here for some time. I expect to be here during the deployment of the next $7 billion - I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Christopher Glynn","Great, thanks.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Robert McCarthy from Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning everyone. Congratulations on a strong end of the year and a constructive guide for \u201918. I think I had just two questions. Back on the expiration of the segments, and I think I know the answer to this and it might be a high decibel answer from Brian nevertheless, you guys were pretty clear that this is about how you organize, not about how you run the underlying businesses. But you are a collection of businesses, of high quality businesses that you\u2019ve acquired over time with entrepreneurs or hard-charging execs in those roles, and is this going to lead to potentially some consolidation of those roles or new faces? In other words, do you think of this change of how you\u2019re operating from maybe more of a feudal system with some guidance above to more centralized management of the businesses? ","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t see anything around centralized management. You\u2019d have to probably educate me about the feudal concept. We don\u2019t have any serfs, and you\u2019re right to describe our people the way you do. We actually sent a note out this morning to the people, and the note says, this probably will have nothing to do with any of your independent businesses. I don\u2019t think it will have much. We\u2019ve never found consolidating things and internal synergies are really that great. We do think a focus on long-term growth is pretty important, and I think that there are processes that we\u2019ve been putting in place around strategic deployment and strategy that Neil can be really gifted at working with all of our people with. So I\u2019m sort of hoping for maybe a little bit better long-term sustainable organic growth power with this, but it doesn\u2019t change anything for individual businesses. It\u2019s not--it\u2019s just better to have all the operating people ultimately reporting to one person.","Then I think long term when you think about succession, I mean, knowing Neil as well as I do and our culture, my guess is that at some point, Neil will say that that role doesn\u2019t need to exist anymore. So it\u2019s just a nice transition opportunity for us to get everybody on the same page.","Neil, you may want to add to that?","Neil Hunn","The only thing I\u2019d add is this business has been built over a long time with a system that\u2019s about the niche orientation, the resource allocation decisions being made at the field, the field operators being held accountable to results, and I don\u2019t see any of that changing for a very, very long time, if ever. I mean, it works for us and it will continue to work.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for that helpful clarification, because obviously that\u2019s been the secret to your existing and continuing success. A related question to that is do you anticipate the output of this analysis or this process that you\u2019re putting together, could this lead potentially to perhaps identifying businesses that are non-core and perhaps would be better served as a separate entity? I mean, obviously this is the old chestnut of the break-up of Roper or a spin of certain more cyclically or capital-intensive businesses of Roper.","Brian Jellison","Well, we\u2019ve talked about that, not at great--the company is not going to break up, period, end of discussion. We might divest some things or we might spin some minor thing. Actually, what\u2019s happened is tax reform makes portfolio adjustment way more attractive when you think about divestments, so as you know, these businesses have been around forever so they have almost no tax basis, so whatever you sell them for, if you\u2019re paying 35%, it\u2019s just hopeless; but if you\u2019re only paying 21%, it might be a little less hopeless depending on what you\u2019re using with the cash you get out of that business. So there\u2019s probably a little--I\u2019d say there\u2019s a modest uptick in our willingness to divest something than we would have had three years ago and further. Most all of our businesses, if they aren\u2019t software related, they still have firmware in their products and they\u2019re communicating. There are only a small number of our businesses that are not like that, and so--but we will take a hard look at those businesses and what\u2019s the optimum use of them. ","Robert McCarthy","If I can sneak just one more in real quick, you\u2019ve made a comment about obviously perhaps an increased focus on U.S. M&A from the standpoint of the ability to redeploy capital here - I think it was a comment on one of the slides, but could you comment on that, and then just comment--I mean, you look at what basically software has done for you in terms of creating a better, more fertile opportunity set of M&A, because you\u2019ve basically been able to find businesses that are around information domain management and then automate them through software or have a subscription business - you know, basically the SaaS model. Has there been any changes in technology in the last five years that creates even more fertile ground for more opportunity for a different kind of software business, and comment on the relative appetite of businesses perhaps in the U.S.","Brian Jellison","Well, the technology is not the driving force there. The driving force is that you have, say, 20 or 25% of your cash that you\u2019re generating each year is offshore, and you can\u2019t repatriate it without a big penalty. Instead of having 100% of your cash flow generation being able to go to deployment activity, you only have 75%. So now we have 100% and we\u2019re not constrained. A lot of the software niches that we buy are U.S.-centric businesses as opposed to global businesses, and so having 100% of your cash available to deploy on those U.S. niche businesses is very likely to lead to us buying more U.S. niche businesses that will get hooked up with Deltek and ConstructConnect and Aderant. That\u2019s the reason we\u2019re sort of raising what we expect to deploy on capital. ","Now you know, it could be the next acquisition we announce will be a German company, but we\u2019re live on four things now and they\u2019re all software-related, and most of them are U.S.-centric. ","Robert McCarthy","Thus endeth the lesson. ","Brian Jellison","There you go.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Giordano from Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, good morning. I just wanted to start with your comments on U.S. lab. Are we talking Sunquest specifically here, and how would you categorize that dynamic now? Is it more market-based, is it a share loss kind of situation, is it a combo, and how does this kind of change your outlook onto bolt-ons to supplement that business? I know you\u2019ve made a few in the past, and is that less likely now?","Brian Jellison","No. The bolt-ons in the business are performing outstandingly well. Those are all double-digit growers, they\u2019re doing exceptionally well. It\u2019s just that the U.S. lab business is in a unique couple of year situation where people are rolling out their ERP that they have acquired over the last X-years, so you went through a period of artificial stimulation with meaningful use at the beginning when we acquired Sunquest. We knew that - that wasn\u2019t a surprise for us, and as that disappeared, what replaced it was the rollout of various ERP projects in which Sunquest was oftentimes the niche lab provider but isn\u2019t going to get renewed at some point in time when that ERP is put in place. That process started to hurt us two years ago and hurt us a little more last year, not going to be helpful this year or next. We already know who all those are, so we expect to [indiscernible] 5 or 6% of our install base to the ERP people. That will stop, and then I think we\u2019ll not only continue to have some sort of modest single-digit growth but we\u2019re likely to start selling and replacing some of the people who tried cumbersome ERP systems that are not good for the laboratory. ","So we\u2019re going to go through this period where the CFO is winning at the expense of the laboratory guy, but at the end of the day, the cost to the hospital we think is minimized with our technology.","Joe Giordano","Fair enough. Then on the TransCore side, is there something that we have to think about from a structural margin perspective related to tags, and we\u2019re seeing more of these systems go in that are camera-based where you don\u2019t need a tag and it just flashes against your license plate. Is that a structural shift in the market that we have to think about the margin dynamics of that business a little bit differently?","Brian Jellison","Well you know, the tags are relatively high margin compared to any of the project work, but all the other technology, we still lead in all the other technology, so if you\u2019re looking at readers and cameras, we actually use our Luminara brand cameras for a whole bunch of the things you\u2019re talking about, and those businesses all have decent margins. It\u2019s just that as the project business continues to grow, and it\u2019s growing at the expense of other public companies that I really shouldn\u2019t name, and all you have to do is read about their total malaise, but the margins associated with our project business are the worst we have. They\u2019re best in class for TransCore - their results are spectacular, but for us they\u2019re a drag on our margins. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change anytime soon.","Robert Crisci","I would just add, even with the camera technology, you still need that tag. I mean, that\u2019s the whole point, is the tag allows the agency to properly collect the funds from the user. The camera is just a back-up, and so you\u2019re always going to have the tag.","Joe Giordano","But don\u2019t a lot of the systems now just take a print of your license plate and mail you a bill in the mail? That\u2019s what a lot of the ones in New York have now, right? ","Brian Jellison","Absolutely some of the ones are license plate drive, but it\u2019s still our collection technology, and oftentimes it\u2019s our collection administration -you know, somebody gets a call for a bill payment, it\u2019s actually our admin people masquerading as whatever the tolling authority in the area is. That\u2019s the big administrative business we\u2019re talking about, which continues to grow at the expense of others but is a little less exciting for us. Its growth will always diminish our gross margins. ","Joe Giordano","Last from me, the delivery of imaging backlog - you know, we\u2019ve been waiting for the cryo-EM stuff we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. How much is that contributing to your lower margin comments for the medical segment? I figure that would be kind of good on top line but mix negative for you guys, I\u2019d assume, right?","Robert Crisci","Yes, so those are good margin products. Their shipments are skewed towards Q2 and Q3, so in Q1 the margin performance of the medical segment is going to be lower than on a full-year basis, so it will be down more than 100 basis points because we\u2019re not yet getting the shipments. Also, a lot of the start-up costs around Australia are hitting in the first quarter, so once you get into Q2, Q3, I would say the margins are not--it\u2019s probably in line with the segment, it\u2019s not really a big headwind with the mix. ","Joe Giordano","Okay.","Brian Jellison ","Yes, the medical segment margins are going to be 41 to 42% EBITDA, for heaven\u2019s sake. They\u2019re still going to be the highest in the company.","Joe Giordano","Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan.","Unknown Analyst","Hey guys, this is actually [indiscernible] on for Steve Tusa. Just had a few questions. I didn\u2019t hear it mentioned, but just wondering did you guys see any impacts from or will you see any impacts from the revenue recognition accounting change ASC 606?","Robert Crisci","Yes, thanks for asking. We are of course adopting that this year, but the impact is less than we probably would have originally estimated before we did all the work. It will be a $15 million or so impact to deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of January 1 of this year, but then the revenue recognized under the new standard will actually make up that number during \u201918, so on a net basis we don\u2019t see it having any impact to our earnings, so it\u2019s going to be something that will of course flow through our GAAP earnings but not something that we feel necessary to call out for any sort of an adjustment, because there really isn\u2019t going to be much of a net impact. But that\u2019s the reason [indiscernible] going through every single one of our companies. Revenue recognition is really a project that\u2019s been going on here the last six months-plus, led by Jason Conley and the accounting department, so we feel very good about that . ","Unknown Analyst","Got it, cool. Thanks for the clarification. Then for the other segments outside medical, can you give a sense of the operating leverage targets? Is 40% a good ballpark to think about year-over-year, operating margin leverage?","Brian Jellison","The enterprise probably comes in in the 30%-plus leverage category with medical\u2019s leverage being less and then industrial and energy, you\u2019d expect 40% leverage plus in those. In RF, it\u2019s kind of a--I mean, it will have high leverage, it\u2019s just what the revenue is, is tough to pick because of TransCore, so probably more like 35 in RF.","Unknown Analyst","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Lastly for me, do you have a sense of timing or likely timing around when we\u2019re going to learn about some decisions around the segment restructuring? ","Brian Jellison","Oh, it could take a year - who knows? We\u2019ve been talking about this since 2016, and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts plus we have acquisitions that will be going on. But part of it is just finding a better way to nest the acquisitions into segments that make a lot of clarity, right?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, okay, got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you, good morning everyone. Just two quick ones from me. Brian, is it inconceivable that you could do some M&A in industrial or energy when we think about the technology overlap and infiltration that we\u2019re starting to see into industrial markets?","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s not inconceivable. I mean, we\u2019re looking at one, sort of a--to the degree we ever did one, we\u2019re involved with one that\u2019s pretty attractive. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d get home on it, but if it was less around a mechanical product--I\u2019d say we wouldn\u2019t do it with a mechanical product. It would have to be something that had an algorithm associated with data collection, and there are an increasing number of those. So yes, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out, it\u2019s just unfortunately, Jeff, most of those come with more asset intensity than we like because--you know, if the need a factory as opposed to an assembly operation, then we probably wouldn\u2019t do it.","Jeff Sprague","Great, and then just back again to the re-seg, not to minimize the complexity and the work you want to do, but it sounds like you have been thinking about it for a long time and you guys are pretty sharp guys, I would think you\u2019ve got a pretty good sense of what you really want to do. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m missing on why it would take a year to figure all this out. Is there something more--","Brian Jellison","It\u2019s a lot of people things, you know? We\u2019ve got a lot of--we have spectacular people. The recent addition of--you know, you look at Aderant, we\u2019ve got a terrific lady that\u2019s running that, Deane Price. We\u2019ve got Mike Corkery has terrific capacity - I\u2019m sure he could be running our company. You\u2019ve got Dave Conway, a lot of capacity, so it\u2019s really a whole lot of it is around where are we investing in human capital.","Jeff Sprague","Right, makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman from Baird.","Richard Eastman","Hi, good morning. Could I just double back for a minute to the medical scientific? I\u2019m just curious, Neil, perhaps could you just define how much of medical scientific, or in particular the medical software, acute care software is international versus U.S.? Perhaps just as a follow-on, speak to the investment that is going into the business - is it going in to make the software more appropriate for the international market? Where is the investment going that you speak to?","Neil Hunn","Of the acute care software grouping, it\u2019s maybe 40% international, 60% U.S. The way that we think about the investment, as we\u2019ve talked a couple times on this call, there is an investment in 2018 in the start-up in Queensland in Australia, so we\u2019ve talked about that. In the U.S. market, it\u2019s less about incremental new investments - we feel we have the right amount of R&D. It\u2019s more about how you orient that and program the R&D dollars for the new products, and also how we--we have changed the way we attack the U.S. channel. We\u2019ve realigned people, we\u2019ve realigned the way they\u2019re going to the market, we\u2019ve added a few new managers in the business to think about that. So it\u2019s more about reorienting what we\u2019re doing in the U.S., so it\u2019s not about incremental new investment there. ","Richard Eastman","Okay, and is any of that stepped up investment going to med products, or have we already funded that given some of the new products sent out to market on the BladderScan side?","Neil Hunn","There is in the medical products group, there is a fair amount of--there is a little bit of product investment year-over-year and there is a fair amount of channel investment across three or four of our businesses there that\u2019s occurring in 2018. That\u2019s a discrete item there.","Richard Eastman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","That will end our question and answer session for this call. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. ","Operator","That will conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19192":["Roper Technologies Inc (NYSE:ROP)  Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call  October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants ","Zack Moxcey - Vice President, Investor Relations","Neil Hunn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Rob Crisci - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants ","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets","Robert McCarthy - Stephens ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Robert Jamieson - Cowen","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Operator","The Roper Technologies Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And now I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.","Zack Moxcey","Good morning. And thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. ","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. ","Now if you'll please turn the Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; transaction related expenses for our completed acquisitions and the announced divestiture of Gatan; and lastly, tax expense adjustments related to our divestitures. ","And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, we'll start with our third quarter highlights. I'll then turn the call over to Rob to discuss our financial results. Then I'll walk us through the segment details and outlook, followed by our Q4 and remaining 2019 guidance. I'll then wrap up our prepared comments with a summary of our third quarter activities and share some of our early thoughts for 2020, then we'll open it up for Q&A. ","Next slide please. We had another really strong quarter here at Roper. Revenue grew to $1.36 billion, margin execution was tremendous, really fantastic, and free cash flow came in at $387 million or 29% of revenue in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 80 basis points in the quarter broadly across the enterprise. And we always like to see the leverage down the P&L with organic revenue plus 2%, EBITDA up 5% and DEPS growing 6%. We saw broad-based growth across our software businesses in both our Application and Network segments. Our medical product franchises remains very strong as well as RF product businesses.","Neptune had a nice quarter coming off strong double-digit comp from a year ago. But we did experience some short-term supply chain capacity constraints, which we will double-click into later in this call. Our Process Technologies segment continue to do a really impressive job of executing through the expected decline in oil and gas markets with tremendous margin improvements in the quarter. Also, we announced and closed two acquisitions, iPipeline and ComputerEase for a total of approximately $1.8 billion. Our capital deployment capability continues to operate at a high level. We'll talk much more about these acquisitions later in the call. ","Further, we successfully executed a $1.2 billion very attractive bond offering in the quarter and we also agreed to the divest Gatan to AMETEK for $925 million, which is a great outcome for Roper and our shareholders. ","Finally, as we look towards 2020 we are encouraged by many factors, not the least of which is TransCore's recent contract award to deploy and maintain New York City's congestion pricing tolling initiative. At the end of the call we will further unpack some of our views for 2020. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated quarterly results. Rob?","Rob Crisci","Thanks Neil, good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide on the Q3 income statement metrics, go over some of the numbers for the quarter. Revenue was $1.358 billion, which was a 3% increase over prior year, organic plus 2%. That organic growth was led by our two segments that are primarily software -- our Application Software segment at plus 5% organic and our Network Software & Systems at plus 4% organic growth. ","Margins, as Neil mentioned, were really spectacular, great execution by our business leadership teams across the enterprise. We had gross margin up 80 basis points to 64.6%, EBITDA margin up 90 basis points to 36.7%, the EBITDA for the quarter of $498 million, which was 5% growth. We benefited a little bit in the quarter as we looked down to the DEPS line from some favorable timing of perpetual license wins where we recognized I would say a few cents of earning in the quarter in Q3 that we had expected originally in Q4 around timing of those wins, primarily at Aderant and Deltek. And that gave us at the bottom-line DEPS of $3.29, which was well above our guidance range of $3.16 to $3.20. ","Next slide. ","Next slide our asset light business model, always one of our favorite slides. As many of you know, the big part of the Roper governance model is our focus on the balance sheet, working capital efficiency. As part of our annual review process we will be meeting with every business over the next couple of months as we look forward to the next three years. Of course, the number one focus on that is going to be around our long-term growth opportunities and strategic deployment for all the businesses and we will also spend some time focusing on do we have the right business model, are we doing a great job in terms of collecting our receivables and managing our working capital, so we can continue to compound our cash flow. ","And if you look at the numbers on the slide, once again, great performance, negative working capital, minus 3.1% for the enterprise. Inventory 4.4%, down quite a bit over six years ago, receivables better than six years ago. And then of course, the big increase in deferred revenue as we've moved more and more towards high recurring revenue model across the enterprise and the deferred revenue of 13.5% is definitely excellent. We expect that number to only continue to rise moving forward. ","Next slide.","On to compounding cash flow. So again consistent strong cash flow conversion for the company. Operating cash flow of $404 million in the quarter represents 30% of revenue, free cash flow of $387 million representing 29% of revenue and a 78% conversion of free cash flow to EBITDA. If you look at our TTM free cash flow, very nice double-digit growth at 12% versus prior year. And if you look to the right to the bars we had a 15% CAGR on TTM free cash flow over the past few years. So again, consistent cash flow compounding at Roper, which we certainly expect to continue. ","Next slide. ","So turning to the next slide on our strong financial position. Soon after we were successful in the iPipeline process in August, we saw what was happening with the overall rate environment. And one of our principles around the balance sheet is to always be opportunistic if we can lock in what we view as good long-term rates. So we went ahead and were able to access the bond market in August, right before the summer slowdown. It was really an excellent job by the full Roper team and all of our advisors to get ready and hit the market and have a really successful outcome. So we were able to do a $1.2 billion bond offering, split between $500 million of five-year notes at 2.35% and $700 million of 10-year notes at 2.95%. At the time, I believe it was the lowest year-to-date coupon for any company at our rating levels. So really a great execution by the broader team. ","Furthermore, the Gatan divestiture as Neil mentioned, we expect to close later this month, that will further enhance our ability to deploy capital. We ended the Q3 right around 3.0 times gross debt to EBITDA and then when we add in the expected $700 million or so proceeds from Gatan we will be well under 3 times. And as you know every month we generate a high level of cash that goes first and foremost to pay down our revolver when there is a balance. And so we always have ample of ability to deploy capital and we will end the quarter here in really a great position to continue deploying capital moving forward and taking advantage of our high quality pipeline of acquisition opportunities. ","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.","Neil Hunn","Thanks Rob. Let's turn to our Application Software segment. Revenue came in at $405 million, which represented increase of 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $168 million, an increase of 7% versus prior year and EBITDA margins were 41.4%. At Deltek we saw the continuation of a few trends that we discussed over the past several quarters. Specifically Deltek grew high single-digits in the quarter following the difficult 2Q comp. In addition, we continue to see a good balance of perpetual software transactions and a continued acceleration in recurring revenues as a result of an increased mix of business towards Deltek SaaS offerings. ","Also the business continued to see a nice bounce of activity across their two macro end markets, professional services and government contracting. Deltek\u2019s team continues to execute exceptionally well. Also in the quarter, we acquired ComputerEase for a $185 million. ComputerEase is a leading enterprise software solution provider for construction firms with particular emphasis on the smaller end of the market. They have over 6,000 customers in North America and deliver the software on -- either on on-premise basis or in the cloud. This solution is very specific to the needs of building contractors including job costing, construction accounting, project management, asset management as well as payroll. This business fits nicely with Deltek's leadership position and the architecture and engineering vertical. This is a great addition to Delkek's AEC platform. ","Aderant experienced yet again double-digit growth as a result of continued share gains within the large law vertical and the adoption of their newer SaaS solutions targeting smaller law firms and cross-selling new products to the larger firms. As you may know, we have highlighted Aderant\u2019s competitive strength for several past quarters and are proud of the long-term market share gains by the Aderant team. ","Strata logged another great quarter based on very strong new logo ads, continued strong renewal activity and the adoption of their new bolt-on products for their cost accounting and decision support SaaS products targeted to the hospital market. Data Innovations and CliniSys performed quite well in the quarter, each up high single-digits. Data Innovations, our global clinical laboratory middleware or connectivity software business continued nice share gains for their core connectivity products. And CliniSys, our European hospital laboratory ERP business continues to benefit from market consolidation in most of the Western European markets. In particular, CliniSys products are essentially the only hospital laboratory ERP products proven to scale to meet the needs of the larger consolidated customers. We're quite bullish that this trend will continue for many years to come. ","And before we turn to the outlook, CBORD did very well in the quarter on increases in their recurring subscription revenues. Of importance, we announced a partnership with Apple whereby the students\u2019 and the faculty\u2019s security and payments credentials can be on-boarded into the Apple Wallet. Six universities Clemson, University of San Francisco, University of Tennessee Knoxville, University of Vermont, MIT, and University in Kentucky have or are adopting this technology for this full year. For CBORD, this opens up a new recurring revenue stream as each credential is activated. Though very early, this could prove to be a nice long-term growth driver for CBORD. And finally, and we have to highlight the tremendous, just excellent cash performance in the quarter from CBORD. Great job and congrats to Jim, Rob and the entire team there. ","As we turn to the outlook, we want to highlight that Deltek and Aderant were benefited by the acceleration of a few high margin perpetual transactions. These transactions were in the sales funnel at the end of last quarter but the timing of which is always difficult to pinpoint. So we assumed they were closed in Q4. But they were executed in Q3. Notwithstanding, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic increases for this segment in Q4. ","Next slide, please. Turning to our Network segment, revenue in our Network Software & Systems segment for the quarter were $394 million, an increase of 4% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $176 million increasing 15% versus the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 44.7%. During the quarter, we acquired iPipeline for $1.625 billion. iPipeline, we\u2019ll report it in this segment, and we'll discuss iPipeline in detail on the following slide. ","The quarter was highlighted by continued growth in our DAT or North American freight match business. In particular, we saw strength in demand for a rate data offering which helped drive increased ARPU in the quarter. Foundry also started strong with double-digit revenue growth in their first full quarter as part of Roper. In particular, there was nice growth across both their media and entertainment core vertical, and their emerging digital design business. Also in the quarter, Jody and the team delivered major releases to both their Nuke and Katana product offering.","iTrade grew double-digits in the quarter based on strong renewal activity and new customer adds. MHA\u2019s performance in the quarter was highlighted by several strong trends. To remind everyone, MHA is the largest group purchasing network for the non-hospital market with leadership positions and long-term care pharmacies, long-term care facilities and home infusion marketplaces. The team continues to win the market share gain relative to on-boarding new and startup pharmacies. Importantly, in the quarter, MHA continued to see the benefits of increased customer purchasing volumes due to several new pharmaceutical products being on contract. ","Also, it's worth reminding everyone about the favorable end market conditions, essentially the aging of America and the increasing demands this aging demographic puts on the healthcare system. This trend benefits MHA. ","Finally, the President of MHA, Mike Sicilian announced his intention to retire from the business. Mike has been the MHA President since our acquisition in 2013 and has done a terrific job growing MHA and providing leadership to both SoftWriters and SHP. Congrats to Mike for a wonderful career with MHA and Roper. And Mike, thank you.","His successor Diane Koontz has been MHA's COO for the GPO business for several years. As a result, MHA's leadership succession plan has been seamless, which is a testament to Mike and Diane working together in pursuit of this transition for several quarters.","Turning to RF IDeas, we continue to see strength in this business. In fact, another record quarter for RF IDeas. The strength was based on continued adoption of RF Ideas\u2019 core reader technology in secure print and secure sign on applications. This is another very good example of a leadership niche business and in this case Roper style products business. Great job by the team. ","And finally, in the quarter TransCore was down low single-digits based on project timing. Importantly TransCore was recently awarded with the design, implementation and maintenance contract for New York City\u2019s Central Business District Tolling Program. The total contract value was approximately $507 million and we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of revenue associated with this contract next year. The recurring revenue operations and maintenance portion of the contract will commence in early 2021 and run for a minimum of six years. Thank you to the MTA for trusting TransCore to deliver on this very important and highly visible contract. And also congratulations to Tracy and the entire TransCore team for building the products and technologies needed to implement this project as well as the many years of experience integrating similar solutions. As we return to the outlook, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic growth for this segment in the final quarter of the year.","Next slide please. iPipeline is a wonderful addition to our growing stable of software businesses. iPipeline is a leader in cloud-based software solutions for the life insurance industry. Specifically, iPipeline provides the necessary workflow automation solutions needed to quote, apply, underwrite and manage life insurance products. The software solutions enable very broad network of carriers, distributors and agents in the sales and delivery of life insurance products. The purchase price was $1.625 billion and is immediately cash accretive. We expect the business to grow in the high single-digit range and this is based on the company's long history of revenue, EBITDA and cash flow growth. ","For 2020, we expect iPipeline to deliver approximately $200 million in revenue at roughly 40% EBITDA margins and generate approximately $70 million of after-tax unlevered free cash flow. Importantly, iPipeline is a Roper style software business. They have very strong cash flow characteristics and is very asset light, in fact negative net working capital. The management teams led by Larry Berran exemplify what we look for in our leaders. Long-term commitment to solving customer problems with solutions that have recurring revenue streams, teams that love to build great businesses. They are the clear leader in this niche vertical and as a result have very deep domain knowledge. And given this, they have very high levels of recurring revenue and their customer intimacy provides clear opportunities to continually enhance the products and solutions to continue to grow over the long-term. We've been tracking this business for several years and are excited to welcome the team to Roper. ","Next slide please. Revenue in the quarter in our Measurement & Analytic Solutions segment were $389 million, a decrease of 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $137 million, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year and EBITDA margins were 34.4%. Verathon had a strong quarter whose growth was led by increases in their GlideScope consumables recurring revenue. In addition, the Verathon team has done a nice job launching their new single use bronchoscope product line, well on path to becoming a meaningful product for Verathon within the first year of launch. ","NDI had another great quarter. This quarter\u2019s strength was rooted in NDI\u2019s electromagnetic and optical measurement systems used by several OEMs in surgical applications. Great job again by the NDI team.","Our CIVCO MMI business in Iowa City had a very nice quarter that was highlighted by strong execution in their ultrasound guidance market. Neptune did well in the quarter especially coming off a strong double-digit comp from a year ago, but the quarter's growth was hampered by supply chain constraints specific to their newer ultrasonic residential meter offering. Of note, over the past couple of years Neptune has invested to develop a static meter based on ultrasound technology for both the residential and larger commercial and industrial meter markets. ","In the quarter Neptune saw bookings for ultrasonic meters outstripped their current production capacity, which we view as generally a good thing as this newer product appears to be striking a positive chord with several new customers. The Neptune operating and supply chain teams are working aggressively to boost production, which we expect to see the benefit of as we head into 2020. All-in-all, a good quarter for Neptune. ","As we expected our short cycle industrial businesses declined high single-digits. This performance was consistent with the last part of last quarter and consistent with our expectations heading into Q3. The business has started taking cost actions in Q3 and will continue into Q4 to best position these businesses for 2020. Importantly, this group did a tremendous job managing margins in the quarter. As we have discussed, we reached an agreement to sell Gatan to AMETEK for $925 million. We expect the sale to close at the end of this month. ","Given the backdrop of a two-year sales process and a very intensive divestiture workload over the last three to four months, the Gatan business had a challenging third quarter down high single-digits as volume shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. We expect most of these delayed shipments to occur after the closing of the divestiture. ","As we turn to our guidance, we see organic revenues flat for the fourth quarter. We see our medical product business is growing mid single-digit plus for the final quarter of the year. We expect Neptune to grow low single-digits as they are working to expand their static meter supply chain capacity and we expect our short cycle industrial businesses to be down high single-digits. Finally, as we mentioned before, we expect the divestiture of Gatan to close later in this month. Of note, Gatan's annual EBITDA has historically been extremely back-end weighted through the last two months of the year, a period we do not expect to own in 2019. ","Next slide please. ","And finally revenue for our Process Technologies segment for the quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $58 million, a decrease of 3% versus prior year and EBITDA margins were 36.6%, an increase of 100 basis points. We saw very strong actually outstanding margin performance for this group of businesses in the quarter. This was driven by our business unit leadership teams executing to remove cost from the businesses on a rapid basis. To this end and it's always worth reminding everyone the vast majority of our businesses\u2019 cost structure are variable. For this reason when times are good we tend to only have modest incrementally positive leverage, but this meaningfully benefits us when times get more challenging. We are able to quickly take cost out of the system and position the businesses in the most optimal manner. The teams did a great job of this in the quarter. ","Relative to CCC we continue to see strength in their LNG project pipeline and we are the contracted vendor in essentially all new projects coming online over the next several years. ","Finally and prior to turning to our guidance, we are excited to announce new presidents at both our PAC and CCC businesses. Both businesses have and continue to perform well, but the addition of Ed and Pete to our team should greatly enhance these two businesses\u2019 ability to develop and deploy strategy, drive targeted operational improvements, and simplify the operational complexity of each of these businesses. Welcome to both Ed and Pete to the Roper family. ","Turning to our outlook, we do see and expect a weakened outlook for upstream oil and gas businesses as we head into Q4. Given this we are guiding to mid single-digit organic revenue declines in this segment for Q4. ","Next slide please. Core guidance, we are tightening our DEPS guidance to a range of $12.98 to $13.02 compared to our prior guidance of $12.94 to $13.06. Also for establishing Q4 adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.36. Please note that Q4 and the full year guidance includes an $0.08 headwind based on the net impact of our Q3 acquisitions and the Q4 divestiture of Gatan. Finally we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% in the quarter. ","Next slide please. As we turn to our final slide before Q&A. We continue to see strength in our niche market strategy and governance model that promotes nimble local execution. This led to strong performance in the quarter across the enterprise. EBITDA margins were up 90 basis points to 36.7%. DEPS grew 6% to $3.29 and TTM free cash flow increased by 12%. Also and importantly, we successfully deployed $1.8 billion for two terrific Roper like software businesses in the quarter, ComputerEase and iPipeline. ","Finally in the quarter we were able to reach an agreement with AMETEK to divest Gatan for $925 million and complete a $1.2 billion bond offering is a very attractive long-term rate. Great execution across the entire enterprise in the quarter. ","As we look towards 2020, we see several encouraging trends. First, our enterprise continues to be less and less exposed to macro cyclical impacts as our expanding software portfolio increases our recurring revenue mix. This is a longer-term trend that we feel great about. ","Next, our balance sheet remains very strong and will only be strengthened by the Gatan divestiture proceeds. Further, our acquisition pipeline remains very strong with several high quality opportunities across various stages of deal maturity. We continue to see a very large number of very high quality assets. ","And finally, TransCore's New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project will drive meaningful revenue, approximately $200 million for the enterprise, beginning in 2020. ","Now as we turn to questions we want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market-leading positions and niche industry. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management teams based on growth. We have a culture of mutual trust and transparency. And finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company. These simple ideas deliver powerful results. ","Now, let's turn the call over to your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. We will begin with Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. ","Deane Dray ","Hey maybe you can just start with some clarification on the perpetual license revenues that came in for Deltek and Aderant. Just give us some context here. Is this the customer deciding when these will be executed and are they one-time? And I think Rob said that it pulled maybe $0.02 out of what would have been in the fourth quarter and the third quarter, is that right? ","Rob Crisci ","Yes, it was probably closer to $0.03, maybe $0.04. It's just timing those things come in at really 100% margin. And so what, go ahead, you can talk about the customers. ","Neil Hunn ","Yes, I mean, the situation for both Aderant and Deltek, these were larger -- on the larger side of transactions. They were pretty late stage in the pipeline as we're preparing our guidance for this coming quarter, but you never know on the timing of these larger deals. And so we'll tend to take a more conservative posture on the timing and they just came in a little bit earlier than we thought. ","Deane Dray ","Got it. And then on the congestion tolling win. So, congratulations on that, everyone has been watching this as the contract and where the first major city in the U.S. will take on this technology. So you already have Stockholm, you already have London. Are there other U.S. cities that you are in negotiations with and do you have the capacity to roll out more of these systems? ","Neil Hunn ","I think there is -- if you Google congestion pricing you see almost every large U.S. city sort of thinking about it or talking about it or in some stage or in the legislation to begin. But that said, all eyes are watching this implementation, not just how TransCore does, but how the initiative works for the city. How the funding works? How it goes? So I think the funding here is going to underlie our support of $15 billion bond offerings which is part of a $50 billion capital plan for MTA. And so the whole picture is being watched, but we're certainly encouraged this could be a very long-term opportunity to do other cities for us. ","Deane Dray ","Got it. And then just last one from me. Just can you clarify on Neptune and this high quality problem of demand on your ultrasonic smart meters? Are you losing any business or any customers getting turned away because you can't supply them over the near-term or is this going into backlog? ","Neil Hunn ","It's 100% going into backlog. In fact the majority of these wins came from competitive displacements of ultrasonic technology that was not working as well as our product does. And so it's in backlog, it was -- this is not a sort of a customer surprise per se. It was just a little bit of push out in terms of capacity on our side. But it's not -- it's all positive from our point of view. ","Operator","And Robert McCarthy with Stephens has the next question. ","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a great quarter. A lot of really good things to talk about. But I think rather than talk about the good things I'll be more of the fox and hedgehog. The Gatan divestiture, I think you guys were in print about a year ago when you announced the sale to Thermo about $150 million in sales. And then I think the most recent press release suggested $180 million, but now I think you cited for the full year expectation of some disappointment there. So, what is the updated expectation for 2019 revenues for Gatan in the context of what you've already disclosed? ","Rob Crisci ","Right. So, yes, the full year numbers are the numbers that were disclosed I think when the announcement was made. So, I mean, there is no update at all to that. ","Robert McCarthy ","Okay, alright. Fair enough. I guess I'll take care of that offline. In a more positive light, obviously longer tune on Neptune, I would say the following. In attending some industry conferences recently around the smart grid in general and grid automation in general across a variety, whether it would be electricity, water et cetera, with the utilities. There seems to be kind of a rising wave that the canopy of the Internet of things and data is really going to be a nice secular growth story here. And it could be the bleeding edge of IoT over the near term. Are you seeing from what you're seeing in Neptune's markets and the software opportunities there even from a capital deployment perspective? Are you seeing a sea change in that market? Is that becoming more attractive to you than perhaps history would suggest? Any color there in terms of what the secular organic dynamics are with respect to that general vertical? ","Neil Hunn ","Yes. So, our experience with in this water industry, I don't think -- there's no sea change. It's sort of tectonically changing. It's slow and paced and conservative. That said, for many years. At least three or four that I can think going through the Neptune strategic plans. They have focused a number of resources on what they call network-as-a-service and then also the data that comes out of the water meter to be able to do more leak detection and more reporting to the customers on sort of their utilization patterns et cetera. So, it is certainly attractive. Neptune opened an R&D center and a software development center in the Atlanta market, the sort of how some of these resources. That said, it is a small part of Neptune today. I mean Neptune is the leader and will continue to be the leader both on the mechanical meters and emerging on the sort of static ultrasonic meters. And as you know, the technology that we place on top of the meter has been a long-term differentiated advantage for us as you don't have to touch the meter as the reading technology changes from sort of mobile to fixed. So, that's our views on there and happy to spend more time on that, if you like. ","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. ","Christopher Glynn ","Curious with the -- on the heels of the efficient reprocessing of the Gatan transaction, just wondering how you're viewing the market overall for strategic buyers of manufacturing assets and your kind of view of that whole dynamic around your portfolio mix? ","Neil Hunn ","I don't know if that's a trick question, but we -- the businesses that we have that are on the product side are great businesses. They've been in the portfolio for a long-time. They're amazing cast producers that enable sort of our -- meaningfully enable our capital deployment strategy. We talked in this quarter how the cost structures are positioned to be on a variable basis to best sort of let us sort of right up and down as the macro market rides them. And so they are in the portfolio. We like them in the portfolio and expect them to stay in the portfolio. ","Christopher Glynn ","And I don't know if this is a hedgehog question or not, but I didn't hear anything on PowerPlan, just wondering how that's tracking financially and culturally. I think you've had it for about a year now? ","Neil Hunn ","Yes culturally it's great. Joe, who is the leader of that business has done a great job with the culture and sort of getting on the right growth sort of drivers and footing. We talked about a couple of times in the past. Well around the time we acquired the business, we were just on the back end of a sort of an industry-wide adoption of lease accounting software to which PowerPlan was one of many benefactors of. On the back side of that we had to -- had in our currently finishing retooling the go-to-market capability to go back to the old school way of identifying leads or working leads and closing leads. So, we saw a great momentum in that last quarter in terms of adds to the pipeline. We saw that continue this quarter, but more importantly the pipeline adds or added last quarter matured and got closer in the later stages of the sales funnel. So, they've done a really nice job retooling the go-to market. We feel good about the business as we head into next year. ","Operator","Next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. ","Unidentified Analyst ","This is [Joe] on for Julian. Just starting with kind of a broader question on your SaaS businesses. As they become a larger part of the portfolio, how are you guys thinking about the longer -- medium term trends of your kind of average revenue per user. You mentioned that Aderant was benefiting this quarter from cross-selling and then things like that. Do you think that's something that's going to be able to have in other SaaS businesses? And then I guess just as a part two there. Are you offering any incentives to your customers to switch over into the SaaS products, I guess at Deltek in particular? And then does that kind of imply a tailwind can come in when those incentives go away a little further down the line? ","Neil Hunn ","Alright. Hey, there's a lot in there. So, I'll try to sort of take it one by one. So, it's hard for us to make out a comprehensive or broad-based sort of statement across the many SaaS businesses that we have or businesses that are selling their products on a subscription basis around the cross-selling up-selling, but it is -- that said for each one, it is a very meaningful part of their strategy, right, where just take the most recent one iPipeline. They've got gross retention in the high 90s and net retention like 110. So, a big part of their strategy is cross-selling and up-selling additional products to the existing customer base. As I'm sure you're aware, I mean the heaviest cost in a SaaS business is the cost to acquire a customer. And so then we want to see the solution sort of stack on top of that over a long period of time. So, we're certainly -- that is certainly the strategy of each one of our businesses. But if that's a generalized statement, it\u2019s hard to give you a specific one because each business -- its deployment against that is unique to that business. Relative to your question on incentives, certainly not from a financial point of view, I mean there is a very compelling value proposition for a customer to migrate their implementation from on-premise to the cloud, not the least of which is the headaches of managing the technology, infrastructure moves to us, to the users of the software. Perhaps the largest benefit of the value proposition is, they get the benefit of all the new releases when the new releases are released, which oftentimes and almost most cases is not the case when it's hosted by the customer and the list goes on, but they are not financial incentives to sort of migrate to the cloud. And again maybe the final thing I would say is, this is -- there is no push from us to mandate X percent of revenue gets into the cloud by Y date. This is very much company by company and that company is being pulled by their customers to go into the cloud. And as a result, the businesses are at various stages of maturity. ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. How are you guys seeing kind of the commercial construction market right now and how that will impact Deltek and other offerings? ","Neil Hunn ","Yes. So, it\u2019s -- the company we have most index -- commercial construction in the U.S. is our construct connect business. The principal business they are in is, is they have virtually every commercial development project in the U.S. They have visibility to that project in the planning phase from many years out when they were just doing the permittings to right before shovel goes in the ground. And so that set of leads if you will or projects becomes more and more valuable to the contractors as the economy gets weaker and weaker. And so it somewhat has a sort of a counter-cyclical sort of demand associated with that. ","So, feel pretty good on the Deltek side with our recent acquisition, ComputerEase on the small end of the contractor side and sort of automating their businesses. Same thing when times get a little bit more tough than the customers look for more efficiencies in the software that we just bought sort of enables that. ","Operator","Moving to a question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. ","Steve Tusa ","So, you guys didn't give a total company organic revenue update for the year, for guidance. I think it was 4% the last quarter. What's that going to be now? ","Neil Hunn ","Yes. So, we gave each of the segments. I think if you add up all the segments for the fourth quarter, it's going to be pretty close to the Q3 organic, so in the 2% range. So, I think if you add that up for the full year, we're somewhere just north of 3%. ","Steve Tusa ","And then with regards to Gatan, I think they said something like $70 million in EBITDA, I'm not sure how much D&A goes with that. But what is the kind of dilution for next year from that deal? ","Rob Crisci ","Yes. So, our best estimate would be $45 million to $50 million of EBITDA would go away. That was in '19 obviously, wouldn't have in 2020. As Neil mentioned, it really is very consistent that their last quarter is their biggest quarter as I'm sure you know from covering us for a long period of time and actually November, December is 35% to 40% of our annual EBITDA typically. So, that's our best guess is sort of what numbers we'll get that we won't get next year. ","Steve Tusa ","Do you know what the difference is between the $70 million and the $50 million that they're talking about $70 million? What's the difference between that and your $50 million? ","Rob Crisci ","November and December. ","Q - Steve Tusa ","Okay, got it. So, it's the calendar issue. Got it. ","Rob Crisci ","Right. We are assuming it gets sold this month. ","Steve Tusa ","Okay. And then one last one, I mean, acknowledging the pipeline looks good at PowerPlan. What is actually -- what was actually the growth of that business in the quarter? ","Rob Crisci ","PowerPlan, the quarter was down a little bit over past -- over last year. ","Neil Hunn ","Steve which is we expected given we are rebuilding the pipeline there. ","Steve Tusa ","Yes. And what is it year-to-date? ","Rob Crisci ","Year-to-date, it's down slightly year-to-date. ","Operator","We'll now move to a question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. And Joe you may be muted please unmute. There's no response from that line. We'll move to the next question. And that will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen. ","Robert Jamieson ","Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe this morning. I just have a follow-up to Deane's question on the New York City order in TransCore. Can you give us a little bit of color on what the margin profile is there and how that changes throughout the contract? ","Neil Hunn ","Yes, it's just pretty simple, right. So, it's a little north of $500 million contract. About half of that is the design and implementation. The remaining half is six years worth of maintenance operations. It's consistent with TransCore's margin structure, which is a little bit below that of Roper on a consolidated basis. ","Robert Jamieson ","Okay, thank you. ","Neil Hunn ","And project profile -- sorry the margin profile is pretty consistent across the totality of the period. ","Robert Jamieson ","Okay, perfect. That helps. And then just another one without giving any names, are there any businesses within your portfolio that you're looking at or that makes sense to divest in the next year or so? ","Neil Hunn ","Certainly, if there were, we couldn't talk about it. So, we can't talk about it. ","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. ","Alex Blanton ","Just wanted to clarify what you said about the margins in the New York City business, you say was slightly below the average for the company? ","Neil Hunn ","Yes. ","Alex Blanton ","I wanted to go to, what you said about CCC and the bridge there, project opportunities going forward. Could you repeat that? ","Neil Hunn ","Sure. There are -- the exact number I don't have on my fingertip. A dozen or so larger LNG projects that are in the feed sort of in the planning phase, late stage of planning phase across the globe and were specified and I think 11 of the 12 and still have an opportunity in the 12th. And so we're -- the long-term sort of projects positioning you see what you've commented on that for several quarters is quite good. ","Alex Blanton ","But what kind of revenue growth that we're talking about there, these compared with let's say the recent past? ","Neil Hunn ","As you know these projects take many years to unfold. And so we're talking about just the very long-term, the next several years of CCC based on these projects, very long lead time projects appears to be quite robust, don't want to get into the comments of specific growth rates of specific companies many years down the road. ","Alex Blanton ","When CCC was first acquired in 1992 they were doing almost entirely retrofits of existing projects because the compressor companies that were selling compressors to these projects were not using CCC software in the compressors that they were delivering initially to those projects. So, CCC would come along and just retrofit because the operators of those projects found that their search control and all of the rest were superior to what was being provided by the OEMs. It sounds as if that has completely changed. Is that correct? Now it's been adopted? ","Neil Hunn ","I wouldn't say it's been completely changed. I mean the balance -- the business is balanced between new projects and retrofits. One of the strategies of the business -- in fact it probably tilted more towards new and a little bit lesser towards the retrofits in the past several years and the leadership team there has worked really hard to position CCC with the various customer opportunities across the globe to do more of getting larger percentage of market share of the retrofit opportunities to get more back in balance. And so we can fully endorse the strategy and look forward to execution against it. ","Alex Blanton","And finally is your principal competition in that business still the OEMs as it was? ","Neil Hunn ","Sure. Yes. ","Operator","And that will end our question-and-answer session for the call. We will now go back to your host for closing remarks. ","Zack Moxcey","Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next call. ","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19190":["Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Zack Moxcey - Investor Relations","Neil Hunn - President and Chief Executive Officer","Rob Crisci - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jason Conley - Vice President and Controller","Shannon O'Callaghan - Vice President of Finance","Conference Call Participants","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Pat Baumann - JPMorgan","Lee Sandquist - Barclays","Robert McCarthy - Stephens","Joe Giordano - Cowen and Company","Joshua Aguilar - Morningstar","Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Roper Technologies First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey.","Zack Moxcey","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.","Now if you'll please turn to slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and lastly, we have adjusted our income statement to exclude the gain on sale from the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses. ","We have also adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid as a result of the sale. GAAP requires this payment to be classified as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to the divestiture. ","And now if you will please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. We'll start our call today with the enterprise highlights and financial results for the quarter. We'll then turn to our segment detail and outlook followed by an update to our 2019 guidance and the establishment of our second quarter guidance. And then turn it over to questions.","Next page. We characterize the first quarter here as a strong start to the year with strong organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow as well as capital deployment. Revenue grew 7% to $1.29 billion with organic growth coming in at 6%. EBITDA improved 13% to $438 million, and margins expanded 170 basis points to 34%. Importantly, we saw margin expansion across all 4 segments, which indicates the breadth of the strength of the quarter. Free cash flow improved 15% to $312 million or 24% of revenue. It's always great to see the expansion down the P&L.","Revenue grew 7%; EBITDA, 13%; free cash flow grew 15%. So the leverage expansion down the P&L is always something we'd like to see. Also in the quarter, we announced our new segmentation, and we'll talk about that in a few slides. Importantly, we completed the sale of our Scientific Imaging businesses on February 5th. And we also completed the acquisition of Foundry earlier this month.","Certainly a good quarter. And now I'll turn it over to Rob to walk us through the P&L.","Rob Crisci","Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the income statement metric page. Revenue grew 7%, 6% organically, as Neil mentioned, to $1.288 billion. We had our 3 largest segments, each grew organically between 6% and 9%. Our smallest segment, Process Technologies, grew 1%, which did exceed our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 63% as we continue to benefit from our increased mix of high-margin software businesses. So we are very well positioned should any macro headwinds build around tariffs and material cost inflation or anything that's like that, really would have minimal impact for Roper as they have historically had very minimal impact.","EBITDA grew 13% with EBITDA margin expanding to 34%. We really had very high leverage in the quarter aided by a couple of items: the timing of some perpetual software license wins where revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and also some compliance payments in our GPO network business that really come in at close to 100% margins. So that impacted the leverage in the quarter, which was very strong.","Earnings before taxes grew 15%. As you can see, our tax rate was lower than expected at 9.7%. This includes a $43 million or $0.41 discrete benefit due to foreign restructuring. We've been simplifying our legal entity structure to make it easier to access and repatriate our foreign cash and as a result, we will be able to realize some net operating losses in the future. So overall, our DEPS of $3.30 was an increase of 26%. If we adjust out for the tax item, we were still at $2.89, which was a very strong quarter for Roper overall.","Moving on to the next slide. Always one of our favorites, the asset-light business model. So the networking capital position at the end of the first quarter: inventory 4.5% of revenue; receivables, 16.6%; payables, 10.8%; deferred revenue grew to 13.5%. The deferred revenue grew 19% on a year-over-year basis, ending the quarter at $694 million. So if you add that altogether, we had negative 3% of working capital really for the first quarter 3 years in a row down to 3.3%.","Foundry, our recent acquisition, which we'll talk more about shortly, has a significant negative net working capital balance that will further enhance our position and continue to expand our ability to compound cash flow moving forward. The net working capital for Roper remains a source of cash.","Next slide. On compounding cash flow, so aided by our negative networking capital, organic growth, disciplined capital employment, we continue to produce excellent cash flow results and excellent cash flow compounding. The Q1 operating cash flow was $330 million, an increase of 17% versus prior year. As Zack mentioned at the beginning of the call, this excludes the $39 million cash payment related to the Scientific Imaging divestiture completed during the quarter. Free cash flow, as Neil mentioned, grew 15%, represented 24% of revenue. So if you look at it on a TTM basis, we are nearly $1.5 billion of operating cash flow, up 30% versus prior year, really fantastic result. And that represented 28% of revenue over the previous 12 months. So certainly, we believe that cash remains the best measure of performance.","Next slide. So moving to the strong financial position in the balance sheet slide. We ended the first quarter with our gross debt of $4.5 billion, net debt of $4.1 billion against TTM EBITDA now approaching $1.9 billion. So our gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2.4x and our net debt-to-EBITDA down all the way to 2.2 times at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did close and fund the Foundry acquisition where we really used a combination of cash and debt. So if we adjust for the Foundry acquisition, we are still down to 2.4 times net debt. Furthermore, the Gatan divestiture would bring an additional $700 million of cash. When that is closed, we're assuming the end of the second quarter in the guidance. And so that would further decrease our leverage position. So in summary, we remain very well positioned to continue to deploy capital moving forward towards our pipeline of high-quality acquisition target.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Neil to review the segments.","Neil Hunn","Thanks, Rob. If we can turn now to Page 11 where we're summarizing our new segments. Earlier in the quarter, we did announce the new segments. To remind everyone, our resegmentation process was not a portfolio or a business review. Also, the resegmentation does not have anything to do with how we run or operate our governance model but rather how we summarize the activities of our 45 businesses in a manner that is more easily understood by investors and is more consistent with our strategy. So to this end, we chose to resegment based on a business model construct versus end market. ","As you know, as we deploy capital, we are not constrained by end markets as we are in pursuit of acquiring the best business models available, the essence of our cash return on investment-led strategy. Hence, it makes the most sense to organize in this manner. Starting with Application Software. This is the first of our 2 software segments. This segment has businesses that are delivering software applications to customers. You can see the businesses included in the segment, Aderant, Deltek, PowerPlan, Strata, to name a few. Perhaps the easiest to understand is Aderant. Aderant delivers enterprise Application Software to law firms. These customers will run their business on Aderant software. This segment represented 28% of our 2018 revenues, has gross margins of 67% and EBITDA margins of 40%.","Now turning to our Network, Software & Systems segment. This is our second software segment. These businesses are ones that have a network component to their business model. Think of situations where the customers derive benefit not only from our software but also being part of a broader network. An example of a network business is DAT. DAT is our two-sided network that matches thousands of brokers and tens of thousands of carriers into full truckload spot freight market. ","This segment represented 26% of our 2018 revenues, has gross margins of 68% and EBITDA margins of 43%. On the bottom left is our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment. Think of this segment as one of our 2-product segments that is diversified in terms of end markets and has quite stable long-term growth. This segment has our medical product portfolio as well as our industrial test and measurement type businesses. The segment represented 33% of our 2018 revenues, had gross margins of 59% and EBITDA margins of 33%.","And finally, on the bottom right is our Process Technologies segment, by far, our smallest segment and our second product segment. This segment has 10 businesses that are largely indexed to the oil and gas end market. While this segment represents only 13% of our revenues last year, they have incredible business model: 56% gross margins and 36% EBITDA margins. Clearly, they are still a collection of assets in the space.","Turning to the next page, Application Software. Revenue in the quarter, which represented 30% of our first quarter results was $382 million, an increase of 7% organically. EBITDA was $149 million, which grew 23% versus the prior year and represented a 39% margin. We saw a continued strong performance at Deltek. They turned in high single-digit revenue growth with great operating leverage and multiple enterprise or large customer wins in the quarter. Importantly, we saw continued double-digit growth in their SaaS and subscription revenue stream based on acquiring net new customers and having successful conversions from on-premise to SaaS. One thing we may not talk enough about with Deltek is really the balance and durability of their growth drivers. There are many growth drivers for this business. They attack the small and medium-size businesses as well as large enterprise businesses. They have the government contracting business, there are product lines as well as they serve the professional services market. They have North American focus and a European and rest of the world focus. They certainly have an on-premise capability and a SaaS capability. So the businesses has had a great run of growth and it's not leveraged to one or a small number of growth vectors. It's really tied to a large breadth of opportunity. So a great job by the team at Deltek.","We also saw in the quarter outstanding growth at Strata, which was led by strength in its Hospital Decision Support SaaS bookings. We don't talk a lot about Strata. Just to remind you what they do is this is a core solution used by hospitals and health systems, in particular, the CFO's office, to model the changing nature of hospitals' economics. Over the last several years, hospitals have had to be more risk bearing in terms of the care they deliver and as a result, they need to more intimately understand the connections between their cost structure, their risk-based revenue contracts and Strata sells software that provides visibility to that for hospital CFO's and their financial staffs. So great job by Dan and John and the entire team at Strata for the growth they turned in.","We also continue to see share gains in large law coupled with a very successful attach rate of the new SaaS billing product at Aderant. Great job with the continuation of the execution there.","PowerPlan is focused on building pipeline in their core product offerings following a very strong lease accounting software demand over the past several quarters.","And finally, we'll highlight CBORD's growth in their food and nutrition software sales to their health care end market. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we see 4% to 6% organic growth in this segment. The second quarter EBITDA margins we see coming in similar to that of the first quarter as we expect a greater mix of SaaS versus perpetual in the second quarter as compared to last year. This is particularly driven by our strategy of pacing our SaaS conversions at the pace that our customers desire. So the results in some will vary quarter-to-quarter or have some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter based on the mix between SaaS and on-premise. For instance, Deltek had very strong perpetual in the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.","So before we turn to the next slide, last quarter, we talked generically about our SaaS -- or cloud migration strategy, the long-term benefits that will be enjoyed by our customers and the positive implications for our business model. To briefly summarize, first and importantly, we asked our businesses to move at the pace of our customers versus forcing the conversion on our timetable. Time and time again, this has proven to be the winning strategy. In several cases, we've been the benefactor of competitors' decisions to force the timetable as their customers have migrated to our solution.","Next, we believe the SaaS deployment model has many inherent benefits for the customer: easier enablement of upgrades and new features, lower cost of total ownership, elimination of technical operations and a single throat to choke, to name a few. Relative to our business model, the cloud transition greatly enhances the ability to sell and deploy add-on products, deploy new features more broadly and at a faster pace, drive increased back office and tech stack efficiency, improve cash return investment, all while being a net growth driver. Also, let's not forget that all our software solutions are very specific built-for-purpose solutions targeted at solving very specific customer pain points, the essence of our niche strategy.","All of our software businesses are in some phase of their cloud migration, again, paced by our customers interest in moving to the cloud. One example, a good example of our cloud migration experience to be highlighted with Deltek. Deltek launched its cloud offering in 2011 over 8 years ago. ","Over this period, they deployed over 10,000 customers to their cloud offering. Importantly, during Roper's ownership, we've invested significantly north of 15% of revenue in R&D, much of which has been centered on user experience, building and launching new products such as VantagePoint and the continual migration of our tech stack to the cloud. By pacing at their clients desire to move to the cloud, Deltek has been quite successful at keeping a very modern code base and tech stack while building new products and delivering new product features. All of this has resulted in consistent high single-digit organic growth, an increase in recurring revenue to be approximately 70% and the continuation of very high customer retention rate.","Next slide, please. Network Software & Systems revenue in the quarter represented 27% of Roper's revenue and was $346 million, which indicated a 9% increase organically. EBITDA was $150 million and represented a 43.3% margin. In the quarter, we saw just excellent growth at DAT from continued net subscriber adds and increased revenue per customer. It's important to note that this network has value to its constituents in different macroeconomic environments. Regardless, the value is very strong whether the trucking and shipping market is running hot, there's value to the participants or if it cooled off a little bit as we saw in the second quarter, it still has tremendous value as shippers and carriers are trying to match networks for the loads. So we saw a very nice growth in the quarter at the DAT business.","We also saw strong performance at MHA for market share gains and vendor contract compliance. To remind you, MHA is our network that connects thousands of health care providers to hundreds of vendors in the marketplace in a procurement network. And so it's great to see the strong performance in MHA. iTrade grew based on strong renewal activity and net subscriber additions. And late in the first quarter, iTrade announced a block chain initiative with the goal to increase safety, sustainability and visibility of the food supply chain. Using block chain or a decentralized ledger, iTrade will more easily enable interested parties to gain access to the relevant data. ","iTrade will leverage its network of over 5,000 growers, retailers, distributors, restaurant operators and logistics providers in building the network. Importantly, most of the data needed for this farm to fork traceability block chain already exists natively within the iTrade application. The iTrade block chain is designed for interoperability, using the same industry standards utilized by IBM Food Trust and others. This is a great example of the leadership position that many of our businesses take within their industry niche. We saw double-digit growth from RF IDeas in a secure print and identity management solution. This is business we acquired a number of years ago. It's really a fantastic business. ","What they do is think of the security badge you have to get into your building from a physical perspective. RF IDeas makes an integrated reader that reads the hundreds of protocols for those security badges, and the readers use a nonsecurity situation. So imagine secure print. The printer companies and OEMs embed a reader in the printers, and then you can go use any of these security protocols to then credential you to have a secure print. Or in the health care setting, think about secure sign-on for doctors and nurses relative to the electronic medical records. Instead of having to type their name and password in, they can use their credential. It allows them to see more patients. So the company has done a great job at working with, scores of OEMs embed their technology into their end application. And we've seen great growth over several quarters at RF IDeas. ","We'll return to TransCore. They had, again, excellent execution in the back office software and services, and they always do a great job with the tolling project execution. And we saw low single-digit growth in that business.","And as we mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Foundry last week. That business is a network. We'll describe that here shortly. It will be housed in our network Software & Systems segment.","So as we turn to the outlook for the 2Q to 4Q, we see 4% to 6% organic growth for the segment for the balance of the year. We also see Q2 '19 EBITDA margins to be similar to that of Q1. And before we turn to the next slide, and it's specific to a targeted TransCore pursuit, we'll be honored if we were to be selected to be the technology and implementation partner for the Manhattan congestion pricing initiative. While still in procurement, TransCore has deployed its very best team and look forward to working with the authority if given the opportunity.","Next slide. The Foundry acquisition. Boy, this is just a great acquisition for us, and it meets all of our criteria. Starting, it has tremendous cash flow characteristics and negative net working capital, so it checks the box clearly and unambiguously from a cash return point of view. The management team that we met is really stellar. Oftentimes when you're meeting a management team, they have a -- they have 6 people or so you're meeting during the process, and you like the majority of them but there's always 1 or 2 that you're not so sure about. In this case, the entire team was just fantastic from top to bottom. We're excited to work with them.","In a minute, we'll talk about, in detail, the niche orientation they have and the clear leadership position they have in that niche, but they are clearly the standard in what they do. And as a result, they have super deep domain experience, high recurring revenues given their long tenure in what they do, and then multiple opportunities to grow. The purchase price is $410 million, and we view it to be immediately cash accretive. For the first 12 months of ownership, we expect there to be about $75 million of revenue come in roughly at 40% EBITDA margins, so it would be about $25 million of unleveraged free cash flow. And we view this as a high single-digit organic grower.","Foundry is a great niche software business that enjoys several network benefits, and we're excited to have them join the Roper family. But first, what do they do? Foundry software is used to composite or combine visual effects, animation and 3D content in the media entertainment and digital design industry. So what does this mean? My way of example, and if you're a Game of Thrones fan and no spoilers here, the compositing or combining of all the period scenes with computer-generated dragons with live-action fire with a computer-generated legions of soldiers is enabled and completed by Foundry Software Solutions. With its 20 years of history, Foundry has become the standard for compositing in the media entertainment industry.","In digital design, Foundry addresses the gap in the market for artist-friendly 3D software use and design. With Foundry software, their clients are able to create photo-ready designs of new product concepts that massively reduce new product development time tables with significantly lower supply chain risk. Foundry's customers range from Pixar to Mercedes to New Balance. Importantly, the business has over 30,000 customers and has deeply embedded global ecosystem or network of evangelists. The vast majority of computer graphic arts students are trained in college on Foundry's applications. They learn to composite using Foundry. Given the increase in computer-generated visual effects in virtually all media productions, the supply chain has developed in such a manner that Foundry is the communication standard for the outsourcing of visual effects. Foundry, again, is the standard tool used across the media entertainment industry use for compositing. In fact, Foundry has been used on every VFX Oscar award-winning film for the past decade. We believe Roper's long-term ownership and investment model will help extend Foundry's network effects and industry-leading position. Foundry is another great net software business for Roper.","Next slide, and turning to our Measurement & Analytical solution segment. The revenue is represented 31% of our aggregate revenue across the enterprise in the quarter and were $402 million, an increase of 6% organically. EBITDA came in at $128 million and represented a 31.9% margin. We'll start, as we always do, with highlighting Neptune's continued high single-digit growth from their continued share gains driven by their customer-focused innovation. No weather impact there.","Verathon had very solid execution of its new product launch for its next-generation GlideScope systems. It's off to a good start from the launch perspective, but it's still early. And we'll watch closely as how it unfolds for the balance of the year. We had a record quarter in Northern Digital, driven by optical measurement systems and consumables growth. From time to time, we talk about Northern Digital, but just to remind you, this is our measurement science business that has 2 core technologies, electromagnetics and optical, that's used principally in health care applications and embedded in OEM solutions. ","And they measure with great precision where the tip of a surgeon instrument might be in brain surgery or where the tip of a catheter might be in the cardiac procedure and many others, so it's just a fantastic business. They are clearly the world's best at what they do and as we see it in the financial results and consistent. So really a great job by Dave and team up in Canada for doing a great job not just this quarter but over a long period of time. ","CIVCO Medical Solutions had very broad-based growth driven by channel investments that we made over the course of last year, so it's great to see that business get even more intimate with the customers and see the results financially. Struers growth came from sales of equipment and consumables to multiple industrial end markets. And to remind you, Struers is our industrial materials prep and analysis business. Gatan saw double-digit growth from delivery of its next-generation cryo-EM backlog. ","And as I mentioned at the onset of the call, we completed the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses, but we did so a bit earlier than expected. It actually provided between $0.02 and a $0.03 headwind or impact versus what we thought would happen simply based on closing that transaction a bit earlier than we thought. As we turn to the outlook, we see segment revenues plus 4% to 6% organically for the balance of the year. However, for the second quarter, we expect low single-digit growth due to the timing of Gatan shipments pushing out of the second quarter. This is a $0.05 DEPS negative impact as compared to our expectation from a quarter ago. Finally, we continue to assume Gatan sale to Thermo will close at the end of the second quarter.","Next slide. Process Technologies, which represented 12% of our revenue in the quarter. Revenue was a $158 million or an increase of 1% organic, and EBITDA was $53 million or a margin of 33.5%, just spectacular business this year. Cornell grew double digits from great performance in its industrial end markets, and we saw particular strength in its aftermarket activity. As we have highlighted in the past quarters, CCC grew, in this quarter, high single digits from execution against new LNG construction projects. Currently, there's 11 projects slated for construction around the globe. We're spec'd for 10 of them and have a chance to be spec'd in the final one. So we believe they'll be a series of quarters here of strong performance at CCC. We saw declines, as expected, from our upstream oil and gas businesses due principally to prior comps in the prior period. So upstream oil and gas in this segment is about 25% of the segment.","Based on this quarter's slightly better performance versus our expectations and our quarterly views with our businesses, we are modestly increasing our outlook to be down 1% to 3% organically for the balance of the year versus down 1% to 5% for the whole year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly sequentially flattish to that of the first quarter. This equates to the second quarter being down high single digits, which is consistent with our initial outlook and due principally to a plus-20% comp from a year ago. Again, we see flattish revenue sequentially. For the second half, we see the business roughly flat on a year-over-year basis based on easing comps. So we remain cautious in our outlook here. If planned take away capacity comes online as expected and\/or energy prices remain higher, then there may be some second half upside. We'll have to wait and see.","Now let's turn to our guidance. We continue to be positioned for a strong 2019. And as such, we're raising our full year 2019 guidance. Adjusted DEPS is now $12.70 to $13 where previously it was $12 to $12.40. This includes the Foundry acquisition which closed on April 18. The guidance continues to assume the June 30th Gatan close. We're also improving our organic growth outlook to be 4% to 5% where previously it was 3% to 5%. Our tax rate, we assume, is approximately 22% for the balance of the year. Also, we're establishing our second quarter 2019 guidance with adjusted DEPS in the range of $3 to $3.04.","Turn to the Q1 summary. Again, a great start. Our diversified portfolio of business delivered another excellent quarter, record first quarter results. We saw organic revenue grow 6%, EBITDA grew 13% and importantly, margins expanded in all 4 of our segments, so very broad execution. Free cash flow grew 15% to $312 million, which represented 24% of revenue. So great to see the leverage down the P&L. Again, organic revenue plus 6%, EBITDA plus 13% and free cash flow of plus 15%.","It always starts with our CRI discipline, and we believe our proven business model provides a very scalable platform for continued growth. To this end, following our announcement of Satish Maripuri last quarter, we are delighted to share that Harold Flynn recently joined the Roper leadership team. Harold will focus his efforts on providing group leadership to a number of our product businesses. Harold is a very seasoned executive with experience at IDEXX Laboratories, Abbot and Zimmer. The combination of Jeff Paulson, Chris Krieps and Harold will provide leadership to our portfolio of product companies. Like Satish, Harold deeply understands Roper, our model, our approach. We're very excited to welcome Harold to our leadership team.","Now turning to capital deployment. We are excited to have closed the Foundry transaction earlier this month. As we described earlier, we view this to be a near-perfect fit against our niche strategy and our network strategy and are excited to welcome Craig, Martin, Jody and the entire Foundry team to the Roper family.","Setting Foundry aside, we continue to be excited about our capital deployment prospects in 2019. As Rob mentioned, our balance sheet remains super well positioned for a strong capital deployment for the balance of the year. The number of very high quality assets we've seen in the last several months continues to be encouraging, and our pipeline is quite full. Importantly, our CRI orientation and M&A process help us identify the very best businesses to acquire.","Now as we turn to questions, we want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market-leading positions in niche industries.","We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management teams based on growth. We have a culture of mutual trust and transparency and finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company. These simple ideas deliver powerful results.","We'll now turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I wanted, just to start off with a comment that we appreciate all the hard work that went into that the resegmentation. And as promised, this recasting just makes a lot of sense since it's easier to see and explain the portfolio, so thank you for all, getting that to the finish line. And on Foundry, just your comments this morning. Just to let you know, you had me at Game of Thrones, so that actually worked for us. So first question is on Deltek. And it was interesting that you recently had a big database software cloud provider actually call out Deltek as an opportunity for them. Our experience is has been with good businesses with attractive margins. It can attract new competitors, but what do you make of this? And maybe some comments about the moat that Deltek has? And how you expect this to play out?","Neil Hunn","Yes. I appreciate the question. We read the same comments. There's a series of companies that were listed, so we'll talk specifically about Deltek. I can't comment at all about the other companies that were listed. And we certainly highlighted a number of those when we went through the, our SaaS strategy with Deltek. But I think, perhaps the most important thing to start with is that not just Deltek but all of our businesses are in niches and have very specific built-for-purpose software aimed at a specific user. And so if you think about Deltek, government contracting, right? it is a, we are the ax in that space from a software perspective. Virtually every large enterprise uses our software because of, it does what it does so well, you don't have to customize it or tweak it or tune it. It's both on-premise and in the cloud. And then you have a considerable amount of R&D resources that are just 100% focused on making that product better.","Same thing can be said for the professional services end market. Deltek does not attack professional services broadly. They attack architects, they attack engineering firms, they attack marketing services firms, accounting firms, so very targeted. And the way those businesses run their business are not just generic to professional services. And so you buy our software out of the box, and a normal marketing services firm can actually deploy without any customizations at all in any way, shape or form where the larger places, you have to go through a SI layer and do sort of customizations, then you have to worry about upgradability of those and whatnot. So the core of what we do is preferred by our customers and that seen time and time again with win the rates is an excess of 50% when you go head to head for net new opportunities against the larger players. And then from a code-based, tech stack cloud strategy, I think we're as current as anybody can be in that business.","Deane Dray","That's all really helpful. Appreciate it. And then just as a follow-up, can you clarify what the drivers are on the boost to the low end of organic revenue growth for the year.","Rob Crisci","Yes. Sure. Good morning. This is Rob. I think overall, we certainly had some outperformance in the first quarter. And I think if we look at all of our segments, we see, sort of, at least as good as originally planned or a little bit better. I think specifically in the Process Technologies segment, which is the smallest segment, we upped our outlook there where we're not seeing sort of a downside as bad as we thought coming in. And so we're just up the bottom of the range a little bit. I'd say, overall, a little bit of outperformance everywhere and a little bit of a better outlook everywhere.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","So some of the businesses you acquire are -- lots of them always interesting to think about the network effect. Clearly, Foundry seems prohibitive of competitive risk. I'm wondering particularly with the network segment if any of these stronger results are kind of kicking into a higher gear, potentially you're accelerating a network effect breakout. And I'll anchor the question around MHA, and iTrade maybe suggest that dynamic.","Laurence Hunn","So I'll start broadly, and then try to get specific to iTrade and MHA. So I would not characterize that -- It's like this breakout of networks, right? I -- Yes, we've seen that consistently at DAT. It's truly a two-sided network where both sides incrementally gain more value as the size of network improves. ConstructConnect, iTrade, for example, is what we'll call one-sided networks where we need sort of the anchor tenants. In ConstructConnect, which is the general contractors, and then -- In iTrade, the retailers to be in the network. And then it drives supply chain efficiency through. So we've seen just good solid execution across those businesses. So it's not -- it has a network effect but it's not one where -- it's driven because of the execution of the software and the sales and the distribution capabilities of the business.","On MHA, this is a group purchasing organization. They've continually done a great job of retaining their customers, adding customers, adding new products to the portfolio that our providers -- health care providers can buy. And then there's what we call compliance activities, both Rob and I called it out. This is where you're just constantly monitoring and make sure that both sides of the network pay what they need to pay the network. And there's a large amount of that activity in the quarter, so it's nice to see that.","Operator","And with JPMorgan, we'll hear from Steve Tusa.","Pat Baumann","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is actually Pat Baumann for Steve Tusa. Quick follow up to Deane's question on the bridge on your organic raise. Can you bridge us on the EPS raise for the year as well to $0.65 at the midpoint?","Rob Crisci","Sure. So the $0.41 discrete tax item we mentioned, if you look at M&A, we've got around $0.07 or so net of incremental M&A. While we had the -- call it around $0.14 for Foundry, as Neil mentioned, we lost $0.02 or $0.03 from the Imaging transaction closing sooner than expected. That actually hit in the first quarter, and then there's around $0.05 for the Gatan shipments, so they're slipping to the period where we don't expect to own the business anymore. So if you net all of that together, you get $0.07. And then the remainder, $0.17 or so, that's your, sort of, just better operations, better operations, better margins and better organic growth throughout the portfolio.","Pat Baumann","Got you. That's really helpful. And then maybe circling back to, a lot of, obviously, commentary on Deltek given the comments from that large company. You said it was up high single digit organically in the quarter. Just wanted to kind of step back. And if you could offer some perspective on how is that business grown organically since you bought it back in 2016? I think you were kind of alluding to a high single-digit type growth rate but just wanted to confirm that. And then on...","Neil Hunn","No. That's right.","Rob Crisci","Yes, it's been high single-digit organic since we bought it, which is better than we expected. We expected mid-single.","Neil Hunn","Yes. And I, we highlighted that when we talked about, the Deltek SaaS migration has resulted in that high single digit growth since we've owned it.","Pat Baumann","Yes. Yes. And then also just wondering have you guys done any deals there since acquiring it? Just curious what kind of deals you've done to try to bolster the business if at all.","Neil Hunn","There's been a couple of bolt-ons. Now the high single digit we talked about is organic, right, so the growth there is not...","Rob Crisci","It's quite a bit higher if you include the M&A that we've done.","Neil Hunn","Exactly.","Rob Crisci","We've done several acquisitions also that add to that business.","Neil Hunn","Small tuck-ins generally characterized as products that can be sold to the existing customer base. We've talked about ConceptShare and Workbook in the past to name a couple.","Pat Baumann","So what is the revenue base now if you don't mind sharing some color on that?","Rob Crisci","We don't like to give exact revenue numbers on our businesses, but I think we said it would be $550 million. The first year we owned it, it's way over $100 million on top of that $550 million.","Operator","Next is Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Lee Sandquist","This is Lee Sandquist on for Julian. You highlighted double digit SaaS growth in application software. How big is the SaaS business today? And secondly, could you just provide a little bit of color about the margin differential here versus other software models in your own portfolio?","Neil Hunn","So I'll take the first part of this then let Rob follow-up. So we talked about the double-digit SaaS at Deltek. I just, I want to be clear in our commentary there, that's not a broad Roper statement. And I'll let Rob talk about the percentage of the total revenue of Roper that's software and SaaS.","Rob Crisci","Yes. I mean where we sit today of the software revenue is pretty evenly split from a SaaS subscription model and a license on-prem model, and that's been moving more towards SaaS and we expect that to continue. But as we sit here today, the business models are roughly the same, about even. And then as we've talked about in the past, EBITDA, software EBITDA for Roper is an excess of 50% at this point in time.","Lee Sandquist","Okay. And then compressor controls has put together several nice quarters in a row now. How far below peak are we? And then secondly, how large is the LNG exposure since you called it out in that business?","Rob Crisci","Yes. So compressor controls is historically a late-cycle business, so it just bottomed out later than the rest of the oil and gas businesses, and it has begun growing since sometime late last year. And I think it's an opportunity there with a lot of, Neil mentioned there's a lot of LNG opportunities out there that we expect to get our fair share of. So this business is the size that is roughly 20% of our Process Technologies segment, so I think those upsides, sort of tailwind opportunities that are exciting. But again, it's a recently small part of the overall Roper portfolio and a small part of the segment.","Neil Hunn","Yes. And I would add. It's obviously highly indexed LNG, it's what they do. But it's not just tied to new. I mean there's a lot of retrofit Brownfield activity as well that they consistently add channel capacity to identify and the capability to drive upgrades there.","Operator","And we'll hear from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","Hi. This is Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy. How are you today?","Rob Crisci","Thank you for joining us.","Robert McCarthy","Well I think a lot of people were tapped in and across a lot of land lines right now, also bunch of different calls. So one thing I wanted to catch up on in all seriousness is -- and I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. What is the update you can provide with respect to Gatan and the potential divestiture there?","Laurence Hunn","So the update is, as we talked about, it's in our guidance through the end of the second quarter. We're in, along with Thermo, we've been working through the regulatory process with the U.K. CMA. And we're hopeful that concludes here at the end of the second quarter.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. So you're still confident that this can be done?","Laurence Hunn","Certainly. There's lots of resources working on clearing the CMA objections.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. Thank you for that color. And then maybe you could talk about -- I think you mentioned -- Is it Harold Flynn?","Laurence Hunn","Yes.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. Maybe you could just amplify kind of what he's going to bring to the table and talk about his background, his experience and what you're really looking for? Two or three key things that you think that's really going to help you kind of use him to enhance the governance and kind of coaching across the platform.","Laurence Hunn","Sure. So first, what is the role of the Group Executive here, right? The role is to help coach both the company's to become great and achieve greatness and help the leaders in the businesses become great leaders, right? And we think about that across many dimensions, but 3 principal ones are how do you develop strategy? We want that to be very much outside in and focus on answering 2 questions: Where to play and how to win. We care a lot about how that strategy is executed. We want it to not be a project of the leadership team's of the companies. We want it to be process enabling and -- so that it can endure a long period of time.","Third thing is we care a lot about how our teams develop their talent, engage their talent and run a talent offense. And so the group executive layer is focused on those 3 things: strategy, strategy the deployment and talent, broadly speaking, in addition to the day to day and week to week things that come up.","So Harold, and it's not just Harold, but in the product businesses, Chris and Jeff that I mentioned, their job is to do that. And Harold's case, and I would say this is a case for all of our group people, they're very growth and process oriented. They have a strong orientation towards talent, they're super strong cultural fit. They're probably nothing more important in our vetting exercise here. We're only 50 people in this office or 55 people in Sarasota. There's only a handful of these group executives, and we need that cultural fit to be really tight, which it is with Harold. And then the thing about Harold and, again, I wouldn't isolate him, Satish is this way, and the other team as well is -- I would consider them sort of learning executives. So they're constantly learning and adapting their style and understanding what Roper is about, right? We want to Roperise them and have them take the Roper governance system out to the companies. ","And then certainly, to be successful here, you have to be financially savvy. That's how I characterize the role and Harold and the team that he works with.","Robert McCarthy","If I can just sneak one more in since I showed up in person. Maybe you could just talk about level setting our expectations for more acquisitions in terms of firepower, opportunity set? And maybe if you could comment on the pricing of assets in the competitive environment.","Laurence Hunn","Okay. So as Rob and I both mentioned, Foundry is just the beginning. We have a very strong balance sheet. We've worked hard to get the balance sheet to be offensively positioned, which it clearly is, and so we're, we feel great about that. The pipeline, we said it now for several quarters, it's very robust. The quality of the assets is quite high. As you know, we're always trying to buy things that are a little bit better than what we are. It's been the hallmark of our strategy for a long period of time. ","So relative to the pricing, with the assets we want, the things that have all the defensive characteristics and network characteristics, great management teams, the negative net working cash flow, mid- to high single-digit organic growers, low capital intensity, those assets are not inexpensive. But in our CRI orientation, there's always value to be gained by our shareholders by deploying capital against those type of assets. So we feel very good about it. We feel very confident about our future here for that type of plan.","Rob Crisci","And on the balance sheet, I think we both mentioned in our comments earlier that the balance sheet is very well positioned, so in the low 2s from a net debt-to-EBITDA standpoint, we're obviously deeply committed to investment grade, but we also have TTM EBITDA approaching $2 billion. So we also have $700 million that would come in as the Gatan deal closes. So with or without that $700 million, we could easily deploy $1.5 billion or more on M&A whenever the opportunity arises.","Neil Hunn","Yes. And from a competitive situation, I would say it's largely unchanged. If there is a super strategic that's going to bear a lot of synergies, we are not and have never been a viable competitor for that target. We're almost always the feedstock of candidate targets for us. It principally come out of private equity. And then at the finish line, we're normally competing against private equity. And so in the asset that we described where the management teams are builders and growers and are attracted to our model, we tend to compete and win at a very high clip when all the things line up.","Robert McCarthy","Congrats on the quarter.","Operator","And we'll hear from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.","Joe Giordano","So I think when you announced Foundry, when you go through the financials of it, it clearly fits the profile, but I think there was at least some thought of, okay, now we're getting into Pixar and some things that we're not used to. Can you maybe just talk about how you guys conceptualize these things internally? As, there almost seems like there is no bridge that's too far when you're looking at it strictly from a financial standpoint, but how do you get comfortable with key man risk at those individual businesses and your ability to be able to run those businesses in that kind of framework, things like that.","Neil Hunn","Sure. So I might have misunderstood a part of that question, but I'll just, I'll clarify so it's on the record. So it's not a bridge too far financially. So these are always...","Joe Giordano","No. Definitely not. It's definitely not. It's not just financial.","Neil Hunn","Okay. Now I understand. So we'll go through our process, right. So the processes is does it meet our CRI thresholds, yes or no? This one clearly does. Then it's about does the management team, are they going to really thrive in our environment? And an easy simple way to think about that is are they fundamentally about, intrinsically motivated about building their business? So when engaged with this team, which we are able to do a couple of times before the process started, it's very clear that this team is completely passionate about what they do. They've been doing it for a very long period of time. The technology officers in this business actually have personal awards for what they've done in this animation sort of compositing space. And so they are built-for-purpose for this business. Then we get into is it a business we like and that's, is it in a niche? Is it a leader, network effects, all the things we've been through many, many times. And so one of the things we did as a team think through is, hey, it's meeting all these criteria, but is it -- does it do something that's sort of sexy? And do we not like it because of that? And at the end of the day, because it meet -- met all their criteria so perfectly, we're like, \"Hey it's a software business at the end of the day.\" And what they do is they do things that you can see on HBO and other places unlike things, the other things in Roper. But it's really, at the end of the day, a pretty boring software business.","Joe Giordano","Is there maybe -- if I ask that a different way, without naming anything specific obviously, are there examples that you could tell us of companies that have met the financial criteria? But when you guys get in the room, you're like, Do we really even understand what's going on here at this business and maybe we're not the right owners?","Laurence Hunn","All the time, right? And so we see scores of our amazing CRI businesses, and then when we start doing the work, I would say the number 1 reason we walk away if it meets our financial criteria is just the management team. For one reason or another, they're not just about builders, so there's not good chemistry or worry that they're going to leave in a short period of time. And then if you're still comfortable there, if there's a product that we're worried about, could there be -- if there's -- if we view there's any sort of 0 in the Monte Carlo analysis, then we generally are walking away, right? Being long-term owners, we don't want to onboard any of that risk. So we spend a lot of time around that.","Rob Crisci","And if we don't yet know the industry well, we do a ton of work around the industry with outside consultants, and there's a lot, a lot of work that goes on. There's many readouts. And if anything scares us away, we just say no, and we walk away. And that happens all the time.","Operator","And we'll next hear from Joshua Aguilar from Morningstar.","Joshua Aguilar","Hey guys. Can you hear me?","Laurence Hunn","Yes good morning. ","Joshua Aguilar","Hey. How are you doing? Hey. We were -- So I wanted to go back a little bit to the annual contract value because I think you recently said at a conference that you've been reporting 50% higher annual contract values in ConstructConnect in just the first year and 1.5 years of ownership alone. And so some of the internal debate we had was really around was this more to -- maybe perhaps they were underpricing their product at that time? Or were you looking to the cover of the cost of the purchase sooner? Or where would you push back on the -- somebody who would insert something like that?","Laurence Hunn","Yes. So I appreciate the question on ConstructConnect. So I think we talked about a couple of times in the past, ConstructConnect, again to set the context is our network that connects general contractors and subcontractors to building product manufacturers in its large network. And the strategy since we've owned this business since the fourth quarter of '16 has been to basically drive habitualization of the core product to the contractor community. And to do that, we had to actually build, and we've work to do this, a number of software elements that go on top of and interlink with the contents that we have. And so the increase in revenue per user at ConstructConnect are early gains of our new product launches because we just have more value to sell is what it is. So it's not the construct, like you said, that try to cover our purchase price or anything like that. It's just the continuation of the strategy and the commitment we have to the long-term ownership of the assets.","Joshua Aguilar","Great. Thanks for that. And then I guess a little bit on TransCore. You were talking about that being more of a nationally interoperable solution coming online this year. Is -- how's -- what's the progress there? And maybe you can give me a little bit of insight there if that's okay.","Laurence Hunn","I think it's quite good. I think that's a -- that can reflect in the recent wins we've had and the tolling projects that are ongoing. It's been good execution by the team.","Joshua Aguilar","And last one for me, sorry about that. In terms of just the organic growth guidance, is that just a function of the lower end of process solutions, sorry, Yes, process solutions just kind of moving up? Or is there something else there that I should be looking at in terms of the segments?","Rob Crisci","Yes. I think it's a combination of that and the combination of the outperformance in the first quarter, building that into the full year numbers. Maybe a little bit net, more good guys than bad guys if you look everywhere else. But that's the majority of it.","Operator","We'll next hear from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.","Alex Blanton","What was the dollar amount you paid for Foundry? You could give it in pounds, but I want to know what it was in dollars.","Rob Crisci","Yes. If converted to $530 million or so in dollars. $535 million in dollars.","Alex Blanton","$535 million. Okay. And on compressor controls, you mentioned that it's well below the peak. Is that right?","Rob Crisci","Certainly, if you look at the performance of the business over the past several years, they're just sort of on the way back up given the fact there was no new construction for several quarters, and now the new construction business is starting to come back. As Neil mentioned, they've done well in retrofits and Brownfield activity and doing a great job of covering their install-base and doing a lot of great things for customers. But the new construction projects are just now starting to ramp up with LNG taking the lead.","Alex Blanton","How much is that of the total? When that, When you acquired that business in 1992, most, almost all the business was retrofit because none of the OEMs were using software. People would buy the compressors using the OEM software, and then they would retrofit it with CCC. So, But it sounds to me like that has changed and that you're getting a lot of business now with the OEMs delivering your software with their compressors. Is that the case?","Neil Hunn","Yes. So Alex, I would say that the team over many years has built, it's an incredible capability of getting into this feed and getting this getting prefeed and really speccing projects very, very, very early. It's, as you know, it's a multiple year process to get spec'd in these new projects. It's a true core capability of that business now.","Alex Blanton","And what percentage is pipeline? You used to do a lot of business on gas pipelines. In fact\u2026","Rob Crisci","It's, Yes. It's a pretty small percentage. I don't have the exact number, but it's pretty small.","Alex Blanton","Because when you acquired the business, the first huge contract you got was to equip Gazprom pipeline with your stuff. So that's pretty small now in relation to the total?","Rob Crisci","Yes.","Operator","And we'll end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.","Zack Moxcey","Thank you, everyone for joining us today.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I'll turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Zack, please go ahead.","Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Debbie, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast, and are also available on our website.","Now, if you'll please turn to slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and also further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now, please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is on our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.","For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pre-tax basis: a $16 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions, and $1 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commissions that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition; a $73 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and lastly a $9 million gain on the sale of an Energy product line, less a $2 million charge on a minority investment.","And now, if you please turn to slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey. Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everybody. Here on slide 4, we're detailing the agenda, which will be to start by going through the second quarter financial results, and then look at the segment detail for each of our four reporting segments, and then look at the Q3 and, more importantly, full-year guidance for the company, and take your questions.","So, next slide here on 5, we had a record quarter. It's actually an all-time record-setting quarter in our history, in virtually everything you could measure, certainly including revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. The asset-light businesses that are really protected by these niches had tremendous execution this quarter, great focus. We've extended our quarterly review process as Zack and Shannon and Rob would be able to drive that and hear what everybody is thinking about for the balance of the year, and it was sort of remarkable how consistent everybody was with really only one business, sort of, down throughout the balance of the year. We'll talk about that later. Everybody else fundamentally at mid-single digit growth and above.","Our revenue was up 23% in the quarter to $1.151 billion. We had 6% organic growth. And a great thing is, it really was across all four of the segments. This isn't just related to some bounce in the oil and gas business effect, that really wasn't relevant.","The acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, continue to perform in an exceptional clip. You'll be able to see that when we get into the RF & Software segment. Gross margins were spectacular. They were up 170 basis points to 62.7%. So, I know a lot of other multi-industry types have had cost creep issues, and people worrying about disintermediation and being Amazoned, and you can see that none of those are risks here at Roper.","Our earnings or DEPS were $2.24. Our EBITDA was up 26% to $394 million, sort of $1.6 billion run rate. EBITDA margin was up 70 basis points to 34.3%. And our operating cash flow for the first half of the year was up 33% from last year to $550 million. That allowed us to reduce our debt in the first half of the year alone by $570 million.","And so, after those record results for Q2, we'll turn now to the income statement, next slide. The income statement, as you can see, revenue, gross profit, EBITDA, interest expense was up from $27 million to $46 million, but easily covered by economic performance.","Just a word on the tax rate. What we do is, we take the adjustments, and we assume a 35% tax rate on those adjustments, and you apply the GAAP tax rate, which was 29.7%. And the two together form our tax rate, which is 31% for the second quarter. And we're going to suggest that probably the tax for the second half of the year would be around 30%, a little bit higher in third quarter than in the fourth quarter, which should be a little lower. Net earnings, you can see, we're up 22% to $232 million.","Next slide. On slide 7, we'll look at the continuing ability of us to compound our cash flow. Here you see operating cash flow last year through the first half was $414 million. This year, it's $550 million. And I look back five years ago, at the end of June 30 of 2012, our operating cash flow was $261 million, now it's $550 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow represents 23% of revenue, which I think is pretty well a standalone kind of activity from us.","And our deleveraging in the first half was terrific. We're down below 3.5 times our debt-to-EBITDA credit facility measurement, and we expect to continue to pay that down throughout the balance of the year. And when we say cash is the best measure of performance, all you have to do is look at these numbers, and see why we're so steadfast in our belief about that.","Next slide, if we go to slide 8 here, our asset-light business model. In the first quarter of this year, we actually got to a negative working capital number. And here you'll see we're down to 2.4% negative, and the components are really interesting. If I look at inventory at 4.4% of revenue, five years ago, that number was 7.5%. So terrific results in terms of asset velocity there.","Receivables are at 15.9%. Five years ago, they were 17.7%. Our payables are 11.3%, and five years ago, they were 11.5%. Deferred revenue is massively different, 11.4%. It's absolutely astounding number. When you think about the ratios, that deferred revenue at 11.4% is greater and exceeds the payables and accruals number of 11.3%. And that's what drives us down to a negative number at 2.4%. Five years ago, that number was 9.9%. So you got 1,200 basis points improvement in our balance sheet during that timeframe.","Five years ago, we had $100 million of deferred revenue. And at the end of this quarter, we had $516 million of deferred revenue. So as we grow, we actually have cash provided to us rather than having to use cash to grow, which is an enormous strategic advantage.","Next slide, 9, on our segment detail, we'll go through each of the four \u2013 most importantly, I think the gross margins above 50% for all four of our segments, and that's something that everybody running those segments is very proud of.","Next slide, 10. We look at the largest segment, now, is the Radio Frequency Technology & Software arena. Here, our revenue was up 64%. Organic growth was up 6%, and FX cost us a point. Deltek was really led by their GovCon business that we discussed in the first quarter. And they were successfully able to launch a new software suite that really targets professional services and consulting firms. And that's off to a good start.","Our ConstructConnect business, which has just extreme high-90s recurring revenue, was up high-single digits in their recurring revenue alone in the quarter. And they continue to have expanded opportunities with On Center, as we can cross-sell and do a variety of things there. Most importantly with ConstructConnect, they finally can now, kind of, focus on long-term forward growth. They certainly had to think about their private equity exit all of last year, and the assimilation of some small bolt-on acquisitions. So I think this is the first time they've been able to really behave in a way that creates the long-term behavior that we expect from our businesses.","We wound up having our Annual Meeting this year in June in Cincinnati at the headquarters of ConstructConnect, and had our board meeting there, so that they could get an in-depth look at the ConstructConnect team. And we also brought some of the Deltek leadership in to talk about the opportunities we have with the two, and discussed some of the bolt-on acquisitions that we'll be making for these two businesses that they were analyzing prior to our acquisition, and we continue to work with them to see about which ones we might execute and when that would happen.","Aderant continued to gain share in the quarter. We're very pleased to see their results. They've had a number of significant wins in large law firms, and so the growth rate there is up to double digits, now. And our toll and traffic project business was markedly better from a margin viewpoint. You might remember, in the first quarter, because tag sales were abnormally low for a variety of reasons, the Saudi project with TransSuite software doesn't really use tags, and the MTA tunnel project is mostly readers and other kind of activity. So, the tag shipments sort of came back to normal here on a relative basis in the second quarter and drove margins. In fact, the leverage in RF, sequentially, is nothing short of spectacular.","In the second half of the year, we expect to continue to have sort of mid-single digit growth with continuously good margins and cash performance out of all the software businesses. The tunnel project is going to come full circle in the fourth quarter, where it will still be at a decent rate, but it will have been \u2013 the comp really from the prior year would be in that base, so you won't see much incremental improvement in that project in Q4. And we hope to have it completed here by the end of this year.","Our tag shipments, though, in tolling should continue to improve sequentially. We're seeing a lot of bid activity, and a lot of people trying to get in front of the infrastructure interest that they hope to capture in 2018, but none of us are going to count that until we see something out of the government. We do expect continued momentum at Deltek and ConstructConnect. And then, Deltek, you should know, is seasonally strong in the fourth quarter, so that'll help our results there. And for the entire segment as a whole, we think we should expect mid-single digit organic growth.","So, I'll turn to the next segment on slide 11, Medical & Scientific Imaging. Here, we had, for Medical, organic growth of 5%. Imaging was down low-single digits in the quarter, so the net effect was organic growth for the segment of 4%. FX was a point. The medical products business grew primarily driven by Northern Digital and IPA. The acute software business, which includes our decision support SaaS business for hospitals and diagnostic connectivity, grew and was also helped by some international business that we're growing now.","The alternate site healthcare business was fine. MHA performed very well in the quarter, and both SoftWriters and SHP, which are derivatives of that business, did well.","The Imaging business, while it declined just modestly on a revenue basis, right at the end of the quarter had considerable order placements and requests for some new camera technology that we've been launching that will go into this cryo-EM space, and it's going to drive an unusual second half of the year where we'll be relatively soft. And the Gatan business in the third quarter, as they're gearing up for this, sort of, changeover to the new camera technology, and then that'll result in an extremely strong fourth quarter for them.","So, for the rest of the second half, we still think we'll have sustained kind of mid-single digit growth out of Medical. All three platforms, we think, sort of, will perform similarly in that category. We continue to increase our investment in R&D and channel development for all of those businesses. In fact, in the second quarter of this year, our investment in R&D and channel was up about 18% year-over-year, and yet you can still see margin improvement. Those focuses are really around genetics workflow, some things at NDI that we can't talk about much from a proprietary viewpoint. They're really non-medical electromagnetic applications for virtual reality and augmented reality. We talked about how Imaging will go. And then, mid-single digit organic growth for the entire segment.","The next segment, here on slide 12, let's start with Industrial. And then you can see Industrial grew 9% organically with a point of FX. Neptune really had a spectacular quarter. It was a record in every category. And Struers did extremely well.","Our fluid handling businesses were fine, and then Roper, which is inside the Industrial segment, did have a bounce-back from abnormally low numbers in the past, but not overly material for the segment, but certainly good news for Roper. On the second half of the year, we think we'll get mid-to-high single digit growth, and we do expect to have a record year for Neptune's water meter business. We've got terrific leverage on the growth, as you can see in the segment, and the same with Energy.","So, if we shift to the Energy segment, organic revenue was up 7% here with two points of FX. About 35% of the Energy segment is Industrial. And we made two smaller transactions in here, so we sort of fine-tuned what we're doing. We sold our SETPOINT business, which was a portion of Compressor Controls to (16:06) in the quarter, and that was a little over $10 million. And then, we acquired a Canadian company using Canadian cash to acquire Phase Tech, which is a precision instrument company, that will be managed inside our PAC business. So net, we had a modest outlay of cash to achieve those things. And they'll kind of wash themselves out in revenue, but it will give us some positive EBITDA for 2018.","The Industrial businesses, as a whole, grew sort of high-single digits, which were led really by Dynisco's polymer instruments and rubber instruments. You're probably seeing all of the tire companies investing heavily for new technology.","Oil and gas had modest growth on improvement in the upstream, but that was largely offset by the continued expected decline at Compressor Controls. So not of a lot of bounce. I mean, those businesses were down dramatically in 2015 and 2016, and they're going to be up a little bit this year. The important thing to think about, the little of portion of Energy that's inside Industrial and then the two-thirds that are sort of inside Energy is that, in 2014, they've represented about 17.5% of the company's revenue. Today, they represent about 8.5% of the company's revenue. So, even a variance in those of any direction will no longer have the effect that it once did for the enterprise.","Next slide. If we look at slide 13, the guidance update and \u2013 that's on 14, sorry. So, as we look at the guidance, we're going to raise all three categories of our guidance. We're raising the adjusted DEPS to $9.12 up to $9.30. It previously had been $8.98 to $9.28. We actually started the year at $8.82 to $9.22. Revenue, we started the year at 3% to 5% organic. And at the end of the first quarter, we said, well, maybe 4% to 5%. Now, we're going to say it'll be above 5% for the year. And total revenue, we started out the year saying maybe 20% to 22%. And then, we went up to 21% to 22%. Now, we're saying revenue will be above 22% for the year.","Our operating cash flow is now going to exceed $1.150 billion for the year. And tax, I think I commented on before, we think that tax rate for the balance of the year will probably be in the 30% arena; higher in the third quarter, lower in the fourth quarter. And then, third quarter DEBS is at $2.24 to $2.30, primarily because of the shifting technology in Imaging with cameras which is going to pull stuff into the fourth quarter and out at the third quarter as people would prefer the new products. I think that's about all there is to say on guidance, all good news.","We shift into the summary on the business. You can see that we did have these record results in all of the important categories. Cash return on investment continues to improve at Roper. Most of the multi-industry people are around 20% to 40%. We're going to be over 200% this year. Our cash earnings will be higher. And our networking capital and physical plant, equipment and cumulated depreciation taken together will be lower as a function of sales, and that's what produces the higher cash return.","Half of our EBITDA this year, probably a little more than that will come from software and network businesses. We're going to enjoy, as we have in the second quarter, we think, broad-based organic growth throughout the year. The gross margins, which really demonstrate for those of you that are worried about people being disintermediated, which is one of the things that we've spent a great deal of time on over the last five years as we've reinvented the company to assure we didn't buy assets that had that risk, clearly isn't happening when you have 170 point increase in your gross margins.","Year-to-date operating cash flow, as I said before, up a third to $550 million. Should be even better in the second half of the year. The existing acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, sort of outperformed the enterprise anyway. They're just truly exceptional. And our negative working capital gives us an ability to compound cash, as we grow at a faster clip than we have in the past, which was still best in class. And then, by rapidly deleveraging here, taking $570 million out in the first half, with considerable cash still to come yet this year, it sort of demonstrates the reinvention strategy that we had with the kind of deals we've made in 2015 and 2016, and then the fruit of those gets delivered here in 2017.","A very disciplined capital deployment process is still alive and well, and you can expect substantial capital deployment in 2018 and beyond, and there may still be some yet this year. It should be a breakout year for Roper, and a year everybody can feel really good about.","And lastly, before the Q, I just want to sort of compliment Rob Crisci and Jason Conley and Shannon O'Callaghan, and Zack, and our operating EVPs, Paul Soni and Neil Hunn, in this transition that occurred in the second quarter. It's very seamless. If anything, we've been a little bit more efficient in getting prepared for the call, and I think you'll find everybody is up to speed and knowledgeable about everything that's going on. And it's a nice transition to be able to achieve all that, mostly with internal people.","So, with that, I think we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning, Chris (22:33).","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good to see the transition, a lot of nice new exciting faces there. Hey, the RF margins, look, they've ramped a little faster from the first Q to the second than I expected. I know the new deals have some more back-half-weighted seasonality. Just wondering if that margin ramp was a little steeper than you expected within the first half.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","No. Really, the big story there is the Amtech tag business. And in the first quarter, it was extremely low compared to any kind of normalcy, and the margins associated without the operating profit are substantially higher than the service business. Now, Deltek and ConstructConnect certainly helped us well, but it's really the getting rid of the boat anchor that we had in the first quarter that made the difference as large as it is. Now, that said, sequentially, I think they did produce about $25 million OP on \u2013 $26 million of revenues, so we probably won't have that same leverage every quarter, but leverage is going to be terrific around here at 40% or so.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, within diagnostics, just wondering if you could update the broader complexion for genomics and molecular. How that adoption and progression is taking shape there?","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. It's Neil Hunn. Good morning to you.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, Neil.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, we continue to invest behind the molecular genetic opportunity. It's a new laboratory being set up in virtually every hospital across the world. The adoption \u2013 the number of tests going into practice, it's a slow build, right? So we have to be there to automate the workflows. And we're there today, but we expect this to be a longer-term, multiyear build. And so it's still relatively immaterial in our results today. We'd expect that candidly for the next year or so, maybe two, and then slowly build into a nice, recurring, highly profitable business for us.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I love to give a shout out to the two rookies on the call, if I could. Zack and Shannon, welcome, and best of luck. And, hey, Brian, just maybe we could start off with forward-looking thoughts on the pipeline of SaaS businesses that you're looking at. What the competition is against private equity, staple financing? And then, you did call out as bolt-ons with ConstructConnect and Deltek, and how realistic in near term might those be?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, sort of a bifurcated answer there on the regular deal flow \u2013 deal flow for the world is down about 20% the first half of this year over last year, just in terms of M&A activity. Private equities is very aggressive, probably more so than they have been. There people continue to pour money into private equity, so the more money they get, the less discipline they have to be. Their internal rate of returns continue to get reduced, which doesn't get a lot of conversation; and high-yield debt still assumes there's no risk in the world, and so it's really, really cheap. All those things lead to very high-priced multiples. We haven't seen much in the way of a fall off of activity.","There've been a couple of things we've talked to people about that probably coming in at maybe two turns of price to EBITDA lower than people were suggesting they would be. Fortunately, we still are seeing a lot of activity that would be attractive for us. We're just being cautious sort of throughout the year to get the balance sheet where we wanted. So I think supply and demand is okay.","On these bolt-ons, when we were working in the fourth quarter of last year, we did a lot of work around market development for, particularly, Deltek and, certainly, to some extent for ConstructConnect. So we kind of went through about a dozen different small potential niche bolt-ons for people, and told them we would take a hard look at those beginning in the second half, depending on how the first half went. And certainly, the integration of those businesses, the governance model which has sort of been adopted and in place, and then the in-depth review we had at our board meeting in June has given us confidence to go ahead and execute a couple of these bolt-ons.","Whether they'll happen between now and the end of the year or in the first part of next year, sort of hard to predict. There are conversations that were ongoing before we acquired the businesses, and they'll kind of continue to be held; but, there is a possibility we might agree to one or two or three of these, but they wouldn't be large.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, a question for Rob. So look, I see operating cash flow for the year is up 33%, but the free cash flow conversion this quarter was a touch light versus your historical second quarters. Was there anything unusual, any timing of payments?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I wouldn't say unusual. I'd say it's true we had two tax payments in the second quarter, right, and no tax payments in the first quarter. So given the fact that we have increasing earnings this year, then we have a little bit higher tax payments. We also had the new bonds that we did last year. That payment hits in the second quarter, so that's another incremental $10 million that happened sort of \u2013 $20 million of cash, but sort of think of it as $10 million that would have been in Q1, but actually hits in Q2.","I think on a full-year basis, if you look at our current guidance, we're at about 120%-plus operating cash conversion. I think that's important to note. People like to call the sort of new earnings convention cash EPS, and the reality is it's adjusted EPS and our cash number is always going to be quite a bit higher. So we'll do 120% operating cash conversion on the adjusted EPS number on a full-year basis. So I'd say we're right on track, if not above, where we thought we'd be three months ago.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question I would have is \u2013 and I only get two \u2013 is with respect to the book-to-bill you saw in the quarter, how would you comment? Would you say it's strong, weak versus your own expectations? How do you expect to kind of channel the fill through the back half of the year in terms of the order environment?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I'd say it was strong. We're really trying to avoid talking a lot about, first, because it is so unimportant when you get to all these software businesses. It's not like these book-and-ship business, where they go, but certainly orders were strong in all four segments; book-to-bill was fine. It was over, I think, 1.02 or something.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yes. 1.02 for the company; book-to-bill at Industrial, 1.05. That's a really good number. We had \u2013 we talked about the record year at Neptune. They had a record orders quarter as well. So I think in individual businesses, for us it's very helpful, to Brian's point, overall as a company, as we've moved so much towards software, it's becoming less and less important metric for us sort of at the enterprise level.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then, I guess, taking the vein (30:31) of that question to the working capital, obviously, continued impressive in terms of this transformation to more of an asset-light business model, but help us in terms of what businesses will lead the way in terms of continuing to improve that versus what businesses may be lodestones to there? Maybe talk about the product software mix.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, if you think about half the EBITDA coming from the software and network businesses, generally, all of those \u2013 or none of those would really have a positive working capital number. They'd all be modestly negative, some more so than others. Those businesses have extremely high recurring revenue, so the recurring revenue portion doesn't drive a lot more new deferred revenue. It's only the net new businesses they get that drives the deferred revenue.","Then, you have the sort of other half of the enterprise that is the product businesses, and those have had \u2013 they probably have 90% of the asset velocity improvement that they're going to get over the last, really, 10 years, and in particularly five. You might remember, when I started I said I want to have payables offset the total cost of inventory. And then, all you're doing is managing receivables. And receivables are a different subject, because you get pricing and terms and various things that have to do with growth around receivables.","And so, those businesses don't get the benefit of the deferred revenue, but they do get the asset velocity. They continue to get rewarded, sort of, qualitatively for improving the asset velocity. It's such a big part of the culture. I'm sure like somebody like Shannon, who is inside now from outside, probably is surprised at how much time is spent on that in these quarterly audit reviews and how focused our people on the subject. So we'll get continued growth in that. We have sort of forecast about how deferred revenue grows, and that'll help us.","The other categories, inventory at 4.4% (32:55) and then receivables at 15.9% are probably about as good as you get. And then, payables at 11.5% (sic) [11.3%] is pretty decent. You get less inventory, it's harder to have extended payables.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Best wishes to the new gang.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","(33:11). One more question here is fine. Okay.","Operator","We'll take our next question, then, from Steve Tusi (sic) [Steve Tusa] with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Congrats again to the new guys, even though Shannon is not quite a new guy. But congrats on the new position there.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","(33:39)","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On Sunquest, can you just talk about how the roll-out of, kind of, the new products is coming along there? And just a little bit of color on the organic growth there? And then how you expect that to trend, kind of \u2013 any visibility you have on kind of that picking up in 2018?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we can do that. I think all of the Acute Care businesses are really doing reasonably well. Sunquest in North America has been slower than it has been outside the U.S. I think hospital consolidation, which generally helped the Sunquest brand, the lab portions, (34:16) has been \u2013 while there's still been consolidation, they haven't decided to do anything. So that's been slower than normal. But even with that, we're going to have positive growth for Sunquest throughout all of next year.","And again, I'd just caution everybody, you've got to look at our diagnostic connectivity business, and GeneInsight and UNIConnect and CliniSys is all part of the Acute Care thing. And in total, they're going to be growing this mid-single digit rate. But Neil maybe want to talk specifically about how we're moving ahead with UNIConnect and GeneInsight and Sunquest's whole brand of activity, because it's really incorporating all of those.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","It is, and we talked a little bit about it before on the molecular genetics tracks. I don't want to repeat that, but we also see good activity and momentum internationally, and then also in our community and connectivity parts of the businesses. So, as Brian said, it's been a sort of as expected for this quarter, and sort of mid-single digit grower for us for the balance of the year and into next year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And any update on growth \u2013 anything in Medical? Like, you have the med device businesses that moves around next year that either slows or accelerates? Or is this kind of the \u2013 you're kind of at a good solid trend line right now, given some of the puts and takes. Maybe MHA, drug introductions, anything like that that's currently visible that will kind of swing that number around at all?","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So if we take the \u2013 let's take the three parts. We just talked about the acute care software on the Alternate Site, MHA software, et cetera. That's a very sort of predictable recurring revenue business. We did lap all the one-timers last year. We don't expect them or see them recurring into next year. We'd expect sort of continued mid-single digit growth in that part of the business.","On the product side of the business, it's been, again, a solid mid-single digit grower for us. There's puts and takes, and the growth drivers will be a little bit different next year than this year, but we'd expect it to continue into next year. Mind you, we haven't done our business reviews into next year, and we'll sort of reserve the right to tweak and tune these, but at a high level, that's what we look at.","One thing that might be worth commenting on, Brian touched on in the slide, is the investments that we made in R&D and channels across the platform. They're quite broad. They're obviously the ones in diagnostics international and acute care. We made a number of channel investments in Strata. There're some new categories for our SHP businesses there and again to continue the R&D investments in Northern Digital and Verathon to drive product vitality. In this year, incrementally, that R&D is up $15 million to $20 million across the platform. And so we're doing that to sustain or possibly increase that long-term, mid-single digit growth rate.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How far above the corporate average is Medical R&D at the stage of the game for the segment?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So as a percent of revenue for the segment, it's high-single digits as a percent of revenue. That's just R&D. If we include engineering, it's double-digits.","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Oh, yeah, it'd be double digits.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it. A good quarter.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and welcome to everybody on board as well.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Good morning, Joe. Thanks.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, my first question, it looks like things are just really kind of humming along, especially with the recent acquisitions that you guys have made. And I guess, if you kind of think through those acquisitions really being SaaS-based in industries that historically haven't had a lot of tech, so whether it's legal, construction, government, how are you guys thinking about potential consolidation within those spaces versus adjacencies for other SaaS-based type acquisitions?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, we look at those categories, right? So, the one advantage is when you have a network or sort of platform we have with Deltek and ConstructConnect, or MHA, you can make a small niche acquisition that doesn't have very much profitability, eliminate its cost structure, maintain the investment, get better channel access, and have it be a good deal. So you might find us doing bolt-ons that we would never do as a standalone, whereas, in the old product business, as you would have \u2013 perhaps we've done a standalone business here. So I think that profile could change a little bit.","We've never really been tied down to a particular expansion in a category, right? I think where a lot of the M&A breaks down in the world is people who try to buy their distribution, or try to buy their competitor, and they're frankly driven by their product line nature of what it is they do, and they don't look outside the box for things that are attractive. We've looked at assets in the insurance industry, we've looked at assets in fintech, there's a lot of things that we've looked at, and we continue. We just want to do the best transaction possible. The wonderful thing about cash return as a metric is, instead of looking at an EVA approach, where as long as it's greater than the cost of capital, you could sub-optimize and do it, we're looking at things that are accretive to the cash-return profile, and it gets us a lot more discipline.","The thing I think you'd see we wouldn't do is we're not interested in looking at an SAP or an Oracle type of small platform that applies ubiquitously across a broad series of categories. Basically, we want our software businesses to be providing a solution for a specific type of activity, usually a singular vertical.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, Brian, and I do appreciate the color. I guess maybe going back to prior question and, Rob, just focusing on the cash this quarter was better than we expected as well, how are you guys thinking about the debt paydown for the rest of the year, specifically? And what kind of gross leverage are you guys targeting by the end of the year?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, we certainly have the ability to pay down quite a bit more debt the rest of the year. If you just look at our cash flow guidance, it's probably giving us roughly $400 million of additional cash that we can use to pay down debt. Now, listen, there's also some acquisition opportunities out there that we certainly could look at doing as well. So I think we came into the year saying we would de-lever by sort of $700 million or more, and we're at $570 million, and we're certainly going to still look to lower that number more throughout the rest of the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That makes sense. All right. Thanks, guys.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","We're also focused on increasing our EBITDA.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","That's correct.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, there's two sides to that formula.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, I mean, without tipping your hand, are you talking about Neptune having a great year? You've seen a lot of activity in that market with companies coming to market. How do you view that as \u2013 I know Neptune, a good business on its own right, but a little bit different than what you've been evolving towards. So how do you kind of view that business? How it's doing versus what you're seeing in the market? And appetite for those kind of businesses right now?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, Neptune has been probably the most important acquisition in our history, right? I mean it transformed the company totally. We made the biggest bet that we've ever made on that. We deployed four times the entire EBITDA of the enterprise. We issued equity, we did convertible debt, so we bet the company on Neptune in December of 2003. And it's performed far in excess of what anyone ever believed it would, other than us. We still think they're the \u2013 well, they are the market leader, certainly. We're investing considerable money into software development and a variety of technologies. I don't think people have a clue about what we're doing in those spaces. So we remain very committed to Neptune. We appreciate what it's done for this company, and we think it's got a great long-term future.","We're not interested in water assets, generally, outside the U.S. Neptune has sort of a different capability in North America. The water meters that you look at in Europe are small and are apartment based. So there is some opportunity for commercial, but we're going to do well on a variety of areas. And some of our newer technologies will have a little bit more global reach than the current technology has. So we're pretty comfortable with it. It's certainly, in our view, the highest valued asset globally, and you wouldn't see us make another acquisition in that arena because nobody performs at our level.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Fair enough. Do you guys care to comment on how Deltek and ConstructConnect are doing margin-wise versus the overall segment average?","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, from an EBITDA margin, they're right in the sort of mid-30s, right where we said they'd be, kind of, starting out the year. I mean, they're right on track. They're performing very well. If anything, Deltek over-performed a little bit in Q2 versus what we thought they would do in Q3, as they were able to capitalize on some of the GovCon wins a little bit sooner than we expected; but, from a margin perspective, right on line with what we expected.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, maybe lastly, is there any, like, big lumpiness we have to think about with TransCore with some of your big projects? And at this point, you talked about New York wrapping up, you have Saudi, and then \u2013 was it Houston (44:38) big one going on now? Is there anything we just need to think of cadence-wise?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. That's not abnormal. Those kind of things happen all the time. The Saudi situation will wind down in 2018, but still will be there, while we'll actually just truncate at the end of the year with the MTA tunnel project in New York. But we're certainly having conversations with people about a variety of other things.","I think the last sort of look at kind of a bid situation, we have more bids out, I think, than any time in our history. So it's impossible to predict when they'll happen. I think a lot of people are confused about what the infrastructure situation will be with the government. And those people that feel really bullish about that are at work aggressively and we would benefit from those projects. Whether they ever come to fruition is beyond our ability to interpret.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Just a couple from me. Just at a very high level, is there anything in the ObamaCare meltdown political disarray that kind of ripples through your businesses or showing any signs of change in customer behavior in the near term?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I don't think so. Our businesses are really all centered around things that aren't volume variant, so the number of patients treated, things like that, are not very important in the process. It might be slowing down in this hospital consolidation in North America; maybe decisions around that are a little slower. I don't know, Neil, if you want to add anything to that?","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Just briefly, it didn't \u2013 when the legislation was passed a number of years ago, it wasn't really a tailwind then. So to the extent it gets restructured or wound down or whatever happens, that we don't expect it, as Brian said, to have a meaningful impact. I do think that hospitals wanting to know the environment in which they're operating in will help their decision cycles, but other than that, no impact for us.","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","I think at the very beginning, you had this meaningful use initiative, and so that did drive up the Sunquest lab piece; but, we knew that. We planned for that and kind of worked around it. That's why we've turned it really into the acute care hospital family of activity. And so, we feel pretty good about that.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Also, just thinking about your gross margins, particularly in the software-oriented businesses, particularly, you're still relatively new in this transformation as a company and the headline gross margins look fantastic. But do you think about what your entitlement gross margin is there, where these businesses should be over time? I would think you don't believe they're over-earning. So to \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong, but to what degree do you see margin upside in those businesses?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think you want to be careful. The gross margins are really pretty good. Medical gross margins are 72%, (48:05) right, but then you have a higher rate of R&D, and channel investment in Medical, and you got a higher SG&A. Everything is getting sold direct, nothing goes through distribution. So the net yield is really quite high, but you don't manage those businesses like you do a product business. We're squeezing everything out. If you look at Industrial, there those gross margins are like 51%, but the SG&A is extremely low and you got a little bit of R&D and manufacturing overhead. So they're just different kind of businesses. I think we have learned how to manage all of the things in the portfolio really quite well, and that's why you see 170 basis points improvement in our gross margins (48:57).","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, a number of our software businesses have R&D well into the double-digits as a percent of revenue. I mean, a company like Deltek is in the teens. So it's really about R&D investment, which you would \u2013 certainly you can do given the high gross margin, and still generate EBITDA margin in the 30%, 40% plus range. It's very standard for those businesses.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then, just lastly for me. Good answer previously on Neptune, but what do you see moving into 2018 from a project opportunity or otherwise that would give you some indication on how to think about growth next year?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","For the enterprise as a whole, we haven't really done a lot of that, but when we go through our quarterly review governance process, we kind of talk about what people see and I think most people have, just as basically, they see the second half of this year as quite similar to the first half of this year. I don't think they see a trend that's really different going into 2018 than 2017.","Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.","And Neptune in particular, there aren't large projects, right? We have the big \u2013 you might recall the big Toronto project a few years ago. It's a bunch of small projects in general, just growth in the market. They gained share over the past couple of years, and they're holding that share and they're just growing a little bit ahead of the market. So that's very standard for Neptune.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up there really on the Industrial Tech business and Neptune. When I look at the order growth, kind of mid-teens order growth, was that pretty dispersed across the three pieces of the business there, Neptune Materials and Analysis and Industrial Pump business? Because you had raised \u2013 it appears that you raised maybe the second half growth guide, core growth guide for IT to mid-to-high single digits. Just \u2013 what weighted towards the high-single digit here at this point?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I think, well, as you know, Neptune is about half of the segment. And Neptune had record orders and good backlog for second half delivery. So that's really the big difference. We have a small piece in that segment that's upstream oil and gas, which has been strong but a very, very small number, and there's really no change to our outlook on those businesses, Roper Pump in particular. It's really \u2013 I would think Neptune would be the reason for the slight upgrade in organic for the segment.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I see. And then, also just a question, Brian, when you look at the acquisitions here over the last few years and your movement to the application software area, the medical area, could you just kind of maybe speak to the international growth opportunities in those newer businesses? And does it kind of accelerate your opportunity to grow internationally, given the software penetration that you've had?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","Each one is different, so you can't really make a sort of blanket statement. So ConstructConnect is more around a North American strategy, that is a very global business. It's serving professional services, it doesn't matter where they are, whether they're in Europe or they're in Australasia or \u2013 quite large business reach for that business.","The CBORD business is really for the most part a North American business with a little bit of activity in the Middle East and English-speaking territories. I would say it's not \u2013 it's not radically different than the rest of the businesses. There are just a couple of the software businesses that really aren't focused on international opportunities.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Just in the quarter, the second quarter, international, how do the geographies look relative to the core growth rate, total?","Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, for a company overall, U.S. led the growth. U.S. was mid-single, then sort of rest of the world was more sort of up a little flash.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. God morning, folks. Just two quick questions. First in the software business, can you comment on how sub adds, renewals, retention worked out? And then, as a side to that, on Aderant, congrats on the big wins. Is it big enough to set up a tough comp next year, or not?","Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.","So, this is Neil. On the software, you really have to go company by company on the adds and the retention rates. There's nothing that stands out substantially outside of history. I would comment that the ConstructConnect business is on the slides, recurring revenue growth has accelerated over the past several quarters. So that's a nice highlight for that business, good execution on the sales and marketing front.","On Aderant, it's harder to tell. I mean it's a great quarter. Seasonally, the second quarter is generally strong for the business, just the way the market buys. And we'll just have to see how the pipeline builds specific to next quarter. I would conclude on the Aderant comment that the competitive landscape is stable, our value proposition is high, and nothing has changed in that regard. So the outlook for that business for the next several years remains nice.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Leann, and thank you all for joining us this morning, as we discuss our first quarter results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the web cast, and also on our web site.","So if you please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Next slide? Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, a full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also the part of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP results and adjusted results, consists of three items. Our normal adjustments related to recently acquired businesses on both deferred revenue and inventory valuation which totaled $3 million to both revenue and income measures.","We have also adjusted our operating cash flow to account for the cash taxes paid in the first quarter for the Abel divestiture. The Abel divestiture you may recall was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. GAAP required this amount, $37 million in those tax payments, to be reported as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to that divestiture. We\u2019ve added this $37 million back to reflect the ongoing nature of our cash flow. ","Now if you please turn the Slide 4, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, John. So we\u2019ll go through today the first quarter enterprise results and we\u2019ll look at the detail around the four segments. And the outlook for the remaining of the year and while we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019ll comment on the second quarter and full year guidance at the end and then take your questions.","Next slide. So we start with the Q1 enterprise results. Go to next slide, Slide 6. You can see there is a lot of great thing here, was a very, very good quarter for us and certainly puts us on track for a record 2016, but just one word I\u2019d say before we get started, Mr. Humphrey over here is actually just celebrating this month his 10 completed year with the enterprise. And as John refer to it\u2019s actually his 40th quarter. So with that, let\u2019s take a look at our first quarter and congratulations John.","Revenue was up 4.4% to 906 million versus the first quarter over a year ago and organic, you can see was down 3.2%, which is really not the story, because excluding oil and gas the company\u2019s organic was actually up around 1% and if you look at the headwinds that we knew we had with the end of Toronto and Puerto Rico and so forth really the underlying basis, the activity seeing better than that or like plus 3.","Our orders are up 9% in the quarter to a record. Book-to-bill was really spectacular, because we haven\u2019t had a book-to-bill above 101 for 2.5 years, this time [indiscernible] combined industrial energy together the book-to-bill was 104, medical was 103 and RF was even just here above 1, but actually had an adjustment in there for some debookings around the business that we\u2019re doing something with and otherwise it would have been 102. So very good backlog at 1.2 billion is also very good.","Gross margin was spectacular, gross margin was up 210 basis points to 62.1% and what\u2019s really remarkable given the macroeconomic challenges around the world is each of our four segments improved the gross margin in the first quarter. EBITDA was up 4% and reached 34% EBITDA margin, we\u2019re going to talks more about that, we still don\u2019t report on cash earnings, but increasingly, we need to make sure people understand the quality of our earnings and the cash earnings nature, because we just have so much non-cash amortization.","Our earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.50. Our operating cash flow was 245 million, which represented 27% of our revenue. And the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in 2015, are really performing sort of beyond very well, they have outstanding growth, almost all of them are double-digit grower, so we\u2019ll talk more about that throughout today\u2019s session. We deploy 265 million in acquisitions in the first quarter, we have extremely big and attractive pipeline that we\u2019ll talk a little bit more.","And so with that we can move to Slide, next Slide, which is 7. On the income statement, just to kind of backup some idea about how importantly orders were, I\u2019ll give you our book-to-bill for the last eight quarters was, last year it started out at 98 then 102 on a consolidated basis here. The next quarter was 99 then 101.98, a year before that, it was 101.99-101.98. So you have all way back to Q2 \u201913 to see something as high as the book-to-bill we got here. And that was despite revenue being up.","Gross profit was up 8%, our operating income was basically flat to the prior period, but that\u2019s only because amortization in the quarter was up 120 basis points or $11 million, all of which is not in cash. So big difference between reporting GAAP operating income and what\u2019s really happening on the cash quality of the earnings.","Interest expense was up 7 million, we did $900 million bond offering. In December, which really kind of term out, what we were doing on the revolver. So it gives us substantial capacity well over 1.8 billion [ph] to be able to deploy here a capital deployments throughout the year and it\u2019s certainly worth of the nickel impact. That said the different swings last year\u2019s $1.55 and $1.50 is in track with that nickel.","Next Slide, if we look here as operating in EBITA margins as the company. You\u2019ll see that incrementally the operating margin went from 28.7 to 27.4 that\u2019s with the 120 basis points of amortization, near the backend, you can see essentially it was the same outstanding results as the year before. On the right hand side though so you can see the EBITA margins, which increasingly are more important for us and here there is no D in either side of that equation, this is just earnings before interest tax and amortization.","So that\u2019s actually up in the last two years, 130 basis points from 31.6% to 32.9%. Furthermore, this gross margin increase that we\u2019re getting is encouraging us, which we\u2019re doing at a fast pace to step-up our R&D and engineering investment, which in this quarter was up 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year, it is now reaching 7% of revenue.","Next Slide. Our asset like business model continues and were still easily able to compound our investment and asset like businesses and you get some sense about how important that is. So there is two aspects to slide like this, one is our governance process with our existing business and the second is the quality of the businesses that we continue to acquire. At the end of the firsts quarter just three years ago in 2013, our net number here was 7.7%, today it\u2019s 4%. Nearly a 50% reduction in just three years.","Inventory back at \u201913 was 6.8% today it\u2019s 5.5% receivables were 19.3 and in a tough markets for receivables today they are only 17.4 and payables were 18.4 and now there 19, all go in our way. So we go from 7.7% down the 4% and even just in the last two years they\u2019ve gone from 6.3 % to 4% which is truly a remarkable number, we\u2019re very proud of all of our people focusing on asset velocity and the quality of the businesses that new leadership teams are bringing to us as we acquire them, next slide.","To look at our cash flow per performance here you can see in the quarter operating cash flow was 27% of revenue, free cash flow was 26% of revenue, that\u2019s not a gross margin number, that\u2019s the free cash flow to revenue number 26%. Trailing 12 months operating cash conversion is a 135% and even though the cash conversation is a quarter above 150, we really thought it\u2019s much more balanced to look at the trailing 12 months operating cash flow to eliminate quarterly seasonality that occurs sometimes so, even there you can see gone from 8.44 to 9.13 and a we fully expect this year\u2019s operating cash flow for the full year would be a $1 billion or more. ","We\u2019re continuing to compound cash flow despite these macroeconomic challenges and they are quite substantial for us, we had about a $100 million of foreign exchange in last twelve months and another $100 million of oil and gas headwinds and also the Toronto project for a millions of dollars and Puerto Rico escape which was another $10 million a quarter. So that compounding is to continuing the same way we would expect it to contain and we still think cash is the best measure of performs, next slide.","If we look at the financial position the balance sheet is in really great shape, gives us tremendous amount of powder for capital deployment and our pipeline is really as good, maybe the best it\u2019s ever been. Here you can see we still have the $0.5 billion of cash, our undrawn revolver is actually paid off now it\u2019s $1.850 billion which is very substantial if you look at cash and the undrawn revolver you\u2019d be over $2.3 billion and you could see the EBITDA at a billion 256 will continue grow handsomely throughout the year so we\u2019ll have a very solid debt ratio opportunities. If you look at the last 15 months, we\u2019ve deployed over $2 billion in acquisitions and with a $1.8 billion undrawn revolver we could absolutely repeat that effort and deploy another $2 billion in the next 15 to 18 months, next slide. ","Here we get into the very specific segment detail, next slide. So in the first quarter the segment performance you can see here was again very strong all the way across for line on our EBITDA measurement down at the bottom, there are two really big messages that we try to convey with the slide, and first is there are RF software segment and the medical solution segments together represent over three quarters of the Company\u2019s total EBITDA.","But there is equally important messages here on the left hand side were we look at the energy and industrial business which remain as really extraordinary businesses. Those two business you can see how 25% EBITDA and energy even with all of the difficulty that you see we have very nimble leadership and the quality of those businesses still allow us to drive this kind of result, if you combined the two together $119 million in energy and $171 million in industry you only have $300 million out of our 906 in revenue, and yet you have 81 million of EBITDA on a $300 million base or 27% and those EBITDA margins in energy are going to continue to approve throughout the year.","So great extraordinary businesses in industrial energy despite oil and gas, and oil and gas has becoming less and less critical and hear it\u2019s well less than 9% of revenue. All right next slide.","We start off with the smaller segment which is energy. Energy had negative organic in the quarter of 14%, but essentially all of that was driven by the oil and gas business which now represents just a little over half of the total segment and inside energy it\u2019s different than the industrial portion of oil and gas because our energy business is primarily downstream about 75% downstream, about 25% up stream and the FX as you can see was 1 point. Oil and gas as a portion of the energy segment was down a low level 20% which is pretty much consistent with what we expected throughout the year, the biggest challenge and there used to be our diesel engine shutout valve business, this year it will shift over really to our compressor control business and they\u2019re moving quickly to try to address everything they can do from short fall in project that we will see throughout the year.","Very nimble execution, we haven\u2019t really talked to the market about and the restructuring we\u2019ve done which is been pretty considerable and we\u2019ll do a little bit more in the second quarter, but we\u2019re really not even asking for an adjustment on our restructuring investments because the payback is pretty quick. Zetec in the quarter did extremely well, which was up high single digits, there is a lot of activity around the power generation side in Nuclear and Zetec is best-in-class in this area and its going to enjoy some continuing tailwinds for the next couple of years.","And then just as we move to thinking about the remainder of the year Q2 through Q4, I\u2019ll just remind you that with the pullback in oil and gas about half of the energy systems business is actually industrial, measurement, technologies. We expect high single-digits organic decline in the rest of year, but that\u2019s just because of the oil and gas. And then we think we\u2019ll get this modest growth in the other half of the sector and we think margins will improve throughout the year sequentially and in energies you can see now it\u2019s down to only 9% of the company\u2019s EBITDA. Next side.","If you look at industrial technology, the same situation with the oil and gas organic as a segment was down 5%. However, if you exclude oil and gas, industrial was up organically 3% in the quarter. So the upstream activity which in here is really Roper pump and a little bit of an adjacency there that upstream is about 80% of the market. And the total value of that, it\u2019s only about $10 million out of a 171 million in the segment. So it\u2019s down to less than 5% of revenue. Neptune had a really strong quarter, they were up double digits, then enjoying very good U.S. which overcame the fact this was the last quarter with the negative Toronto project variance which was mid-millions of dollars of headwind.","This segment EBITDA margin I think if we can get a look at to which were really 30.1% on industrial. So the performance despite any of the headwinds that you see is still very solid. In second half of the year, we\u2019re look at kind of low single digit organic growth for the segment. We don\u2019t see any improvement in upstream oil and gas, we think that will actually continue to decline a little bit, but we\u2019ll have kind of flat to modest growth in all of the other markets and then very strong growth at Neptune because as we get into the second quarter, the Toronto project tailwind is essentially behind gas and that was worth quite a bit of -- will be quite a bit of positive variance now in 2, 3 and 4. Next slide.","If you look at the RF and technology and software business and we have to throw the software recognition in here because the software business is actually becoming larger than the totaling business. So when we look at the segment you can see organic was down 1, but actually organic would have been up excluding the roll-off of the Puerto Rico exit that we had, which was $10 million just in that quarter. We had record margin performance throughout this segment, very strong software and SaaS business growth with terrific margins and cash flow and all of those businesses added into our most recent acquisitions performing very well, we got several new wins which are of strategic importance that legal community can be talking about and has already started to discuss and comment on our share gains.","In the toll and traffic area, as we say our IPS business was down because of Puerto Rico, our Tag business continued to be strong, very good project execution and I also want to point out that that OP margin which was up 170 basis points to 32.2, again realized the quality of the cash margin. Our EBITDA margins were at 39.2% up 360 basis points so did the first quarter of the year ago. As we look to the second quarter we expect flat organic growth in Q2 only because we still have one more quarter of the Puerto Rico drag of about 10 million bucks and that\u2019s 3 to 4 points. But in the second half, we\u2019ll have a much stronger organic growth because the Puerto Rico comps will be going away. We\u2019ll get multiple opportunities we think in the Transco projects, we have very exceptional amount of bids in line, pretty confident in a lot of those, and the timing of when those are able to be announced will be important for us.","And then the RF ideas which is doing phenomenally well will become organic in the fourth quarter so that will help our organic revenue comparisons. The software and SaaS business should grow kind of mid to high single digits, just a little bit better than we might have expected previously and they gives us strong cash returns. And then Aderant's is going to continue to gain shares which will help the segment. Next slide.","Here we look at the medical solutions. Medical solutions points to another EBITDA margin story. You see the operating profit margin at 34.7, but that\u2019s just because it has a lot of non-cash amortization, our EBITDA margins are 43.5% in Medical. Organic was up 2%, acquisitions added 13% but medicals organics as a standalone portion of the segment was up 6% organically while imaging was down 13%. We had double digit growth in the medical product which really was driven primarily by Verathon and Northern Digital. The acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in this segment, our performing extremely well, if you put them all together, they actually or growing both at double-digit revenue and EBITDA basis.","We had really exceptional growth at Strata, which is up very dramatically, as more hospitals understand what we\u2019re doing and are signing up for our SaaS solution on their cost visibility and how to contain and structure your costs. We acquired a small business called TCI Medical in the quarter, which will boost Civco\u2019s offering in Ultrasound and that business is close, we\u2019ll add some revenue for us.","If you look at the balance of the year, you have high single digit organic growth in the segment, that comes from continued strength in the medical arena and then Strata SoftWriters and data innovations become organic in Q2, which will make those comps stand out. Very strong performance in all of those acquisitions, the IPA business that we announced some time ago has done particularly well from a growth perspective.","Imaging will continue to improve with kind of substantial gains out of Gatan. Gatan, we\u2019re pointing a lot of money in innovation at Gatan to focus on cryo-EM markets, this involve significant R&D investments, but with really exciting out year opportunity, some of you have read about the discovery of the Zika Virus and how that was done and our products were absolutely crucial to the discovery, technologies that have been announced recently.","We have positive contributions from our CliniSys acquisition, although CliniSys comes in initially at lower margins in the rest of our business, but we\u2019ll continue to improve those as we work with them. Sunquest Investments in Genetics continues we acquired on just a day after the quarter, so we didn\u2019t include it in here GeneInsight, which is a technology and business that was really good by partners help that we\u2019ve been doing in concert with and will have long-term applications in the out years at Medical.","Also I would just say that, when you look at medical in this pie chart down here it\u2019s 43% of the company\u2019s total EBITDA and to put that in perspective, you can see energy the smallest piece of that pie and industrial is the next smallest. Those two together are only 24% of our EBITDA, Medical is 43% and RF is 33%, so you can see what the future looks like. Next Slide.","So here we get into the guidance of the company. For the balance of the year, next slide. So the guidance of date that we\u2019re going to continue our current guidance as we articulated at beginning of the year. So we said the full year would be between 6.85 and 7.15 with the mid-point of $7 and then operating cash flow would be about a billion dollars. And our tax rate guidance is the same it was at the beginning of the year and really everything else, we see the same sort of revenue opportunities. There is one thing, we say about the second quarter, where we establish the guidance at 1.56 to 1.61. We had an extraordinarily low tax rate in the second quarter last year that some people were maybe looking at carefully. Tax rate was only 25%, we would expect the tax rate in the second quarter to be 30% to 30.5%.","Another piece of good news, when we look at FY, we\u2019re really comfortable with the second half of the year. We\u2019re not really seeing any industrial contagion at all in those portions of industrially or the energy businesses that have not oil and gas. And certainly at the beginning of the year that was something that many people were worried about. And the high-end of our end what we really just be dependent on the adoption rates and project timing and seasonal activity. So it\u2019s sure quite good about reinforcing the full year guidance. Next slide.","If we look at the summary of 2016, it\u2019s pretty simple series of things here, right. Revenue is up 4.4%, Medical and Software and Neptune were able to offset all of the declines in oil and gas. Our orders reached record level and got over a billion dollar backlog. Our gross margin, which would let you know how customers continue to feel about us and the products and services we provide or up 210 basis points and as we said each of the four segments increased their gross margin. Good thing is we're investing at the fastest rate in our history in R&D.","Our EBITA margin, you can see is 32.9%, not all EBITDA is the same, we\u2019re already sometimes frustrated people telling us about some of these EBITDA margins, but it\u2019s really mostly D and then the CapEx sucks our away. In our world, the linkage between EBITDA 34 and EBITA 32.9 is only a 110 basis points. EBITDA as we said was up 4% to 307, acquisitions performing very well. We really can\u2019t say enough about how well the acquired leadership teams are performing and how well they\u2019ve embraced the Roper governance process. Every single one of these acquisitions is outperforming our expectation. And we have very attractive pipeline and we had said earlier this year, we expect to deploy over a billion in the year and it could easily be more than that.","So great quarter on track for record 2016 and with that we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. ","Scott Davis","Just trying to get a sense, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked this question before and you may not have the answer off the top of your head, but you said 2015 acquisitions performing very well and clearly that looks to be the case, but can you quantify that? Is there a cash return on capital on those deals that you could quote for the first 12 months out or expected for 2016 or something that we could hang our hat on?","Brian Jellison","Well I think, you\u2019ve been around us a lot to know that I am not a fan of return on invested capital where people look at stuff and don\u2019t add back accumulated depreciation and don\u2019t really realize how much future drawn cash, their CapEx will be. So in our world we look at new cash return on investment. So in that case, you look at the net earnings of the business and then you add back the non-cash charges and you divide it by the gross investment which is the physical plant & equipment plus accumulative depreciation plus networking capital. All of this acquisitions are well above 100% cash returns many of them are in the several hundred percent, cash return basis and some of them get paid in advance for what they do, so they have a negative cash return which is even more powerful. So they are all doing it very well, I think there is a general rule and more you can assume that our acquisitions are going to come in and they\u2019re going to be substantially above the 34% EBITDA margin that the overall enterprise has and that they are going to have higher gross margins than the enterprise and they\u2019re going to have higher cash returns than the enterprise. ","Scott Davis","Okay. Fair enough and as far as you put a lot of capital to work last year I think it was somewhere than 1.85 billion, would you anticipate I mean say over 1 billion in 2016 book, but you also said you have $1.8 billion or so of firepower, would you anticipate something closer to 1 billion or closer to the 1.8 billion that you have in the hoppers as a potential or is it just too early to say?","Brian Jellison","I think that we don\u2019t sort of budget like let\u2019s deploy $1 billion. So just thinking about what we think about it is very simple is we\u2019re going to deploy our cash flow, we\u2019re going to leverage it three times or more debt to the acquired EBITDA. So given this usually its more between 1.35 and 1.5 times our -- the powder of whatever our cash flow is. So if we have 1 billion in operating cash flow, we pay out some dividends or whatever and we multiply that to the acquisitions, it is very easy for us to deploy a 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion all the time.","So that\u2019s why we say we\u2019ll deploy 8 billion over the next four or five years and as we said we deployed 2 billion in the last 15 months, we could easily deploy 2 billion in the next 15 months. So it\u2019s not like a budgetary thing, Scott. I mean we\u2019re looking at things now that are over 2 billion and we\u2019re looking at things that are in the mid-100s of million and which ones we do and when they close is never thought of as a budget kind of thing but our balance sheet capacity and our debt ratios give us as much or more opportunities to invest than we\u2019ve ever had. ","Scott Davis","Okay, great. Good reminder. Thanks guys and congrats on the start of the year. ","Operator","Then we\u2019ll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Just giving all anxiety we had last quarter regarding oil, it\u2019s interesting and some relief that the comments that you\u2019re expecting to see, margins improved sequentially in energy this year. So any comments on the visibility, the backlog and I know you didn\u2019t call it out, you mentioned you did restructuring this quarter, but could recite it for us how much restructuring was done and what that payback is?","Brian Jellison","We got a little bit towards the end of last year in anticipation of the difficulty we did more in the first quarter, we\u2019ll do couple of million dollars here probably in the second quarter, some of that you make the announcement, it takes a long time for people in Europe but we\u2019ll continue to pull back a little bit on the sort of baseline SG&A, but the businesses are really small I think if you add them all up we had about 65 million of oil and gas revenue in energy and about 10 million in industrial, right. So, they really don\u2019t have huge cost basis, they are very high margin businesses, if you look at them with sort of 30% pretax numbers or higher there is just not a lot of cost beside that takeout, we don\u2019t have big factories that we have to worry about with absorption issues and what have you. So there is another couple of million, I think we feel like where we could be.","Deane Dray","And then on organic guidance, I know you had a lot of moving parts in the second quarter especially, but what you\u2019re expecting for organic second quarter and how about for the year versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%.","John Humphrey","We\u2019re still in the same spot as we were when we issued the guidance with respect to the full year, in the 2% to 4% organic, that does imply or in fact it\u2019s a part of our expectation that the second half will be in the mid-single digit organic growth, second quarter would be about flat. ","Deane Dray","Got it and just one last quick on, corporate expense came in a little bit light then what we were looking for where there any unusual items and or timing within corporate?","John Humphrey","No, we\u2019re not in fact that it was about what we had expected, in the it encompasses both from deal expenses as well as the equity compensation for the Company is all recorded that the corporate G&A line, in fact the stock price is up nicely from where it was last year that\u2019s reflecting in that number also.","Deane Dray","Got it actually I emphasize that was -- it came in higher then what we were looking for so, just want to --.","Brian Jellison","That is a directly tied to the share price going up, it\u2019s of equity comp.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","John Humphrey","We help it goes up higher again, it\u2019s a noncash charge. ","Operator","And we go ahead and take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","A couple of things in the mid scientific medical products business the core organic growth in the quarter in orders, what did that look like and may be was there a book to bill in the core business there ex acquisitions?","Brian Jellison","We saw in organic basis for medical we were up 9% versus last year and the book to bill ratio was somewhere to the total, just a little bit above 1 even on core basis. ","Richard Eastman","Okay. And MHA's business, is the pricing component there of their business, is it holding flat or has that improved at all?","Brian Jellison","So the pricing component for the branded drugs is continuing to be a positive contributor there, you do have some other impacts around generics which are either down a little bit or flat in prior you know last in couple of years those have actually been up, so in that net-net pricing is about -- is up very modestly for that not very much. ","Richard Eastman","Okay. But at least flat. Okay. And then just one last question. On the RF business, the EBIT margin there, we have some real positive puts and takes, namely Puerto Rico's exit and then Aderant coming into the revenue and profit number. But is it a reset EBIT run rate that starts to push 32%? Does that start to be somewhat sustainable at that level?","Brian Jellison","Sure, yes. I think it will be in a low 30% range for the year, of course the timing of that -- the software businesses that we have are clearly higher margin, the timing associated with some of our toll and traffic projects which are often times little bit more on the equity side, and have a little bit more of a cost component to them even though there is not any negative drag from a cash flow prospective. Those margins come in a little bit below the average for the segment and so it\u2019s about timing of the IPS project of the toll and traffic project, but will effect that. We still see north of 30% margins here for the remainder of the year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","A couple questions on medical. One, in terms of the plus 6% ex the imaging fees, the plus 6%, MHA, I think, had some comps in the quarter. With MHA down, would medical have been up even more? And then, also, as we think about margins for the second quarter and the year, should medical margins be down again because of either MHA comps or other comps or anything else? Or should we think about those starting to grow again? ","Brian Jellison","You know I think too we\u2019re seeing on the medical, we want to have people understand, but we\u2019re going to continue make acquisitions there, we have extraordinary margins that we had with Sunquest and MHA. We\u2019re going to make lot of acquisitions and we\u2019re going to have better then enterprise margins, but they\u2019ll be dilutive to software component inside medical. So this doesn\u2019t bother as in any way.","Now medical products had spectacular performance versus the medical software which in services -- so we\u2019ve put Sunquest and MHA in the medical software services component and they were down a little bit organically in the first quarter, medical products was up more than double digit and off-course we still have the little bit corruption around imagining because we\u2019ve actually been intentionally winding down certain of kind of imaging businesses while we\u2019re going to have much better growth in Gatan. But the camera stuff this, we are trying to only participate in profitable markets, I don\u2019t know if that helps you, but that\u2019s the best way to explain it.","John Humphrey","And remember the margins in this segment are just extra ordinary [multiple speakers], we expect our operating basis to maintain in the mid-30% all year.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Yes, that's fine. I knew that there was some lumpiness this quarter. Just in terms of getting the margins and the modeling and just lumpiness in terms of some of the margin contracts, that's all I meant. In terms of energy, Brian, you sound pretty constructive on the non-oil and gas parts of energy. Can you give a little more color there, Zetec and also the other pieces, what you're seeing there that you like?","Brian Jellison","Well, we like that they\u2019re not going down. They're inching ahead into low single-digit growth in both sectors, but industrials are going to have better growth because of Neptune. And then in energy we are getting a bit better growth in small business called DJ Instruments, we have business called Alpha that should have a stronger second half and Zetec is high single digits, might even get to the 10% growth, that\u2019s really becoming a secular trend for that. So for a while with Fukushima and other problems with bringing things online, Zetec was really challenged. But today these people are working with us on all kinds of new applications, so we feel really quite good about that. But it\u2019s a relatively small business within the enterprise, but nonetheless important.","Operator","And our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","My first question's, going back to your comment on M&A, Brian, you said it's the best it's ever been. I'm just curious, how much of that is being driven by the IPO market not being all that great right now and PEs having a hard time exiting? I'm just wondering what the driving factors are there.","Brian Jellison","I don\u2019t think, it's really the IPO market, because generally the kind of things we acquire are things that probably wouldn\u2019t go the IPO route. They would either go to a strategic or they\u2019d get flipped to another private equity group. So I think there is a lot of forces of the work, there has certainly been lumpy feedback to sellers about just how much debt capacity they can get on things.","Although frankly we don\u2019t ever see any -- well we see one thing right now but it's got six-times staple, but another one that we\u2019re really pursuing as a six and three quarter staple, there are still some seven staples. But the cost of debt has flipped around quite a lot, sometimes the mezzanine portion unsecured bonds of 10.5% other times they are 9% and the LIBOR 4% has been in play sometimes, maybe they gets 4.75 on the term loan. But it's really isn\u2019t because there\u2019ll be LIBOR 4 of 100 spent, 5.75.","So I do think that there are a lot of private equity people feel as that they\u2019ve got an asset that they are going to sell in the foreseeable future, it may still be as good a time now to sale. And they changed weekly, and first they are very opportunistic right; so our situation, we are not affected by those things and our ability to finance stuff is certainly easier and better than their cost of debt, so I think that helps. But also there is lot of things we are looking at, they have been in various portfolios for a while, and they need to get out. They might be more worried about the financing markets in 2017 than they are announced. So I can think of the time we\u2019ve made a call, somebody has talked to them about their business that they haven\u2019t said come on over.","Joe Ritchie","That's interesting color and helpful. Maybe switching gears a little bit, you mentioned some of the known headwinds in the first half with Puerto Rico and Toronto. As we look into the second-half ramp, what do you need to see from an order standpoint? And how important is the second quarter to hit your organic growth ramp in the second half?","Brian Jellison","Well, what happens is, if you just think about the things that are going away that are reflecting us negatively. I mean if you adjusted for all of our headwinds, which is ridiculous. When you adjust for everything, it's bad. But if you really look through headwinds, we would have been up over 3.5% organically. So the idea that we are going up 2 to 4 organically over the course of the year is not a big challenge. I mean we should do pretty well in the second half, now things that can effect that are going to be the adoption rate of new products and some versions of software that are rolling out in second half, but you never know what those adoption rates will look like, great.","So if they are high then we have a much better opportunity to get to that midpoint number above if they are moderate then it's harder. The second thing on the tolling projects, we have an enormous amount of bid activity right now. But there is never anything us as a supplier can do to influence the beginning or the execution of those projects.","So if they go at an expected pace then that helps, if they go as a slow pace that it\u2019s not particularly helpful and then last year we got nothing, out of the year-end instrumentation businesses in terms of seasonality, that\u2019s the only time that\u2019s happened in a decade. So we would expect to get some more modest returns to seasonality in the fourth quarter in those instrumentation businesses. So those are the things that will determine where we\u2019re at, but within our guidance we\u2019re certainly comfortable that we\u2019re going to be within our guidance for the year irrespective of what happens with Q2 orders.","Operator","Then we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Tusa with JP Morgan.","Stephen Tusa","Just a quick one on healthcare. What do you think for the second quarter organic? And then these acquisitions are obviously crushing it. Just remind us of the impact on the ones that are coming in in the second quarter. And then when you say they're growing strong, I think its Strata and Data Innovations. Are you talking these things are growing 20% plus? Just trying to understand those dynamics because the acquisitions coming in are a big driver.","Brian Jellison","So as far as the segment is concerned, we expect that we are up in high single digits in the second quarter on an organic basis and that is aided a little bit by those acquisitions that turn organic because they\u2019ve been growing, you\u2019re right are well into the double digits even above 20% or maybe a little more. And so they add a couple of points to us for that --.","Stephen Tusa","And those combined last year were like $25 million, something in that range, in the quarter?","Brian Jellison","[Multiple speakers] quarter.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. And then so if you're doing flat in the second quarter to get to 3%, the midpoint of the range organic, it looks like you have to do something in the 7% range in the second half of the year. You mentioned mid-single digits as a tweener. I think some companies we cover would round that up to high single digits to make it look better. But for you guys you're a little more conservative with your messaging. Is that the right math we're talking about? Do you think there's a chance you're in the 7% range in the second half? ","Brian Jellison","That\u2019s the high end of our guidance absolutely.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. So that\u2019s at the high end of the guidance. ","Brian Jellison","If you go to the 4% you\u2019re absolutely right on the math. So kind of we\u2019re at the midpoint, it\u2019s closer to the 6% range for the second half.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Got it. Thanks. Sorry, one more on Neptune, sorry about that, more detail. What was the debooking there? I haven't heard that term that you guys have used before.","John Humphrey","We didn\u2019t have any fee booking at that time. That was in radio frequency software where we had a situation in the UK that we really decided with all parties would we better if they did something other than what they were asking us to do. So we debooked a couple of million dollars in the quarter.","Stephen Tusa","And that comes through in orders obviously. But that's reflected in your orders number or is that adjusted out?","Brian Jellison","Yes. That\u2019s right. ","Stephen Tusa","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Robert P McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Following up on some of these questions that have been raised, the second half organic growth outlook, are you going to have a better sense on the 2Q call what the adoption rates are going to be that drive the variability in your guidance, or is it not something you're going to know until mid 3Q?","Brian Jellison","Better view on the tolling project we\u2019ll have a widely different view on product launches, little bit in the medical products, a little less so on the software version update. But I think maybe you want to think about the fact, we saw we have this sort of artificial, we thought it is real, but we have a 3% to 4% organic drag because in Puerto Rico that goes away right Toronto goes away. So, so many things go away in the segments and they wind up with, if they were growing 3% to 4% organically, some are already growing 3% organically they are just. ","Robert McCarthy","Right. And my only question is, can you declare victory one way or the other on the guide when you report in July, or is it still going to be unclear, is my question.","John Humphrey","We never declare victory until the game is over?","Robert McCarthy","Or you do a big deal. Now, moving on to the restructuring, obviously that's something to be applauded. You do a lot of restructuring. It flows through numbers. Do you have a size across the segments or any flavor we can give? Obviously the returns are incredibly high in terms of what you do. But anything around the narrative around restructuring that would be helpful?","Brian Jellison","All the restructuring is centered around the oil and gas businesses and so a substantial amount of that is Roper pump which is virtually all off -- not, almost all upstream and has just collapsed. I mean it takes your breath away if you look at the numbers in the first quarter of \u201914 versus here. So, we\u2019ve done quite a bit of restructuring there and we\u2019ve done some restructuring at compressor controls and we\u2019ll continue to do more because their underlying service revenue will continue to be good and even grow. Plus the project activity around Compressor Controls will be off quite substantially. So Q2, I\u2019m going to guess $2 million additional as some of these European things finally come to bore. Be less than 3 million or 4 million in the last six months I\u2019d say.","John Humphrey ","And to put a little bit of more context on this. If you look at the number of people and industrial technology is down 10% more it was last year, saying first quarter this year versus first quarter last year. And then our energy segment it\u2019s down, I think 7% or 8%. So our costs unlike most other companies, our cost or people related. We never like to brag about having to reduce people, but when volume goes down, it\u2019s a necessary part of the retrenchment process. And so to put a little bit of contacts around that right, we\u2019ll take big restructuring charges that cost a lot of cash, so you have to close down factories or take out capacity. But we have had quite a substantial reduction in the number of people, who workforce in those two segments.","Brian Jellison","And Robert where you really see it, look at the detrimental margins and energy and you can see that they\u2019re dramatically lower than the gross margin. So people really do a great job and find tuning things.","Robert McCarthy","The last question would be just around the portfolio. This has been asked before so it's not exactly novel. But would you consider just separating into two companies, just allowing -- obviously taking the playbook of a noted competitor and then thinking about pursuing the higher growth opportunities? Do you think there's any crowd-out there that hurts the businesses that perhaps don't have quite the characteristics that your best businesses have?","Brian Jellison","Well, the reality is that, if you look at the industrial and energy businesses, they just have outstanding independent results, right. So they\u2019ve been kind of consolidated businesses with 30% EBITDA. They get all the internal investment they need and they throw off positive cash. So our view on that at least for now is good brief. I mean, why wouldn\u2019t you want to have a portfolio that you could deploy all of your cash into the highest possible returning businesses.","So why keep the capital deployment model by forcing to invest in businesses with inherently lower returns than the technology businesses with inherently higher returns, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense for our investors. From an investor view point, if you split the industrial and energy, you\u2019re going to redeploy cash and stuff that produces dramatically lower returns than the high stuff, I don\u2019t know why investors would like us for doing that.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Good morning. Brian, just wondering if, as it sounded, perhaps you're foreshadowing that Roper will switch to a cash-based preamortization earnings model. ","Brian Jellison","Well, I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019ll continue to watch what people say about that. There is GAAP really does distort a lot of things around cash. So I think we\u2019re content with showing people what the GAAP number is and what the non-GAAP number is. This particular year though, because all acquisitions come in, the loss of non-cash amortization. So it doesn\u2019t show up in operating profit, it distorts the number. So we want to have people understand that things are absolutely fine here. But we haven\u2019t gone to the point of saying, well here is what the cash earnings are, here is our share count and that\u2019s the earnings, cash earnings per share basis.","Christopher Glynn","Okay.","Brian Jellison","We think investors are smart enough to figure that out.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then perhaps another area where there's a little distortion from the sales of the acquired businesses. You talked about the added amortization component of SG&A but that was up a lot, too. Is that an area to whittle away at the deals and that contribution on SG&A to sales? Or is your comment on ramping up RD&E a more important thought there?","Brian Jellison","I\u2019m not sure we understand that question Chris. So there is a lot of happens. When you do an acquisition, say you do a $1 billion acquisition. You\u2019re going to have 2.5% or 3% or maybe more of the purchase price filling into non-cash amortization. So if you deploy a $1 billion are going to have all that cash deployment that\u2019s gone into something never coming back, it\u2019s not like capital reinvest that\u2019s continued to reinvesting and the depreciation is a call in the future. So that non-cash amortization on the billion might be $30 million. So it shows up in GAAP as a reduction in operating profit, when in reality it\u2019s an increasing cash earnings. So that\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about.","Christopher Glynn","Right. Yes, I guess I worded my question poorly. But even independent of the 120 basis points you called out, SG&A to sales was still up a good bit, so I was just wondering.","Brian Jellison","We\u2019re absolutely investing in product management. I mean, just like we said R&D is up 120 basis points. Our sales investments and product management they\u2019re excelling, they\u2019re probably up another 110 basis points. That isn\u2019t going to change. We\u2019re going to continue drive for long-term growth.","John Humphrey","And as we continue to really become much more of a technology company as oppose to manufacturing company. SG&A is that\u2019s where our value add is for customers. It\u2019s not really in the cost of goods sold line. It\u2019s about whether you\u2019re able to machine the widget more efficiently than the next guy. If the intellectual capital which is inherent in the Research & Development, it\u2019s in the engineering, it\u2019s in the customer support and customer application people, show up as G&A. But those are value added resources for us. And as we continue to be more of a technology company, that\u2019s how our P&L will continue to look like with less cost of goods sold and more on the SG&A side. Not as a cost to be reduced, but as an investment in the value producing parts of our enterprise.","Christopher Glynn","Perfect. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning.

Baird","Operator","The Roper Technologies' Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Rob Crisci, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Rob Crisci","Thank you, Audra, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Paul Soni, our Vice President and Controller.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast or also available on our Web site.","Now if you will please turn to slide two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statements. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our Web site.","For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of two items. First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter.","And now, if you will please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian Jellison","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We will start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next Slide.","We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million, and by the way if we had booked the MTA order couple of days earlier but it wasn\u2019t quite ready to go, we would have been -- we would have had our first $1 billion order quarter in our history.","Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX costs us 1 point, and then acquisitions and divestitures netted out plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all the divestment in.","Growth was led by both the medical and RF technologies, software businesses and certainly Neptune. We had an outstanding quarter, you will see in a minute. Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they would be sort of down 20% or so and they were. Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3 and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million. Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65 ahead of our guidance.","Free cash flow was up 40%, really an astonishing quarter, where free cash flow was up 11% year-to-date but up 40% in the third quarter. And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we are announcing today, and which will close this week is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the pre-construction industry, and we will detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close yet this week.","So we had very strong cash quarter. We had record results and then we had this pre-acquisition. So the next Slide. Here if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book to bill was 0.98, which is okay because of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse but had we been able to book the MTA order, our book to bill would have been 1.05, which would give you just some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing in the quarter that was odd is the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong.","Revenue was up 7%. Our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we are up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next Slide you will see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash oriented business like ours. And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate at about what we thought.","Next Slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading first with those kind of numbers, but our EBITDA margins, you can see in 2014's third quarter were 32.5%, last year at 33.4% and this year at 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just two years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If focusing on the operating profit margin where you get a lot of non-cash amortization charges which lead people to the wrong conclusion, it's the wrong way to think about a cash business like ours even though the results are outstanding.","So we are really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins which were up 30 basis points. Next Slide. We continue to comp out cash flow at a quite strong clip and we don\u2019t see that slowing down any time soon. We really have a terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million, both operating and free cash flow were up 40% and you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million, year-to-date operating cash flow, and now we are at $731 million, up 11% despite less than robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses.","Conversion was pretty spectacular, you can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow was 146%. So excellent cash performance. Next Slide. Our asset-light business model which five years ago people told me you couldn\u2019t make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here you can see inventories down 80 basis from two years ago, receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160 basis points.","So, two years ago we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue in the way we measure it. Today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%, that\u2019s a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just two years, 390 basis points. So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we have been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own, is really having just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital.","Next Slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital employment opportunities. We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder, and even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion.","We have deployed capital since January 1 of 2015 at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us, is all great because we are going to be able to put that to good use with an incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7. After the acquisition it's still just around 2. So we\u2019ve got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company.","Next Slide. We will look at the segment detail of each of the four segments the way we had reported and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. So the next Slide. Here if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see it's EBITDA margin was 29%, industrial tech 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable there margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presidents to run those businesses is really amazing.","In 2003 those businesses, the industry and industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue and this year taken together they had $303 million. And yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses and here this year it's 31%. So despite a significant fall off in revenue, the margins have been able to maintained. The second point of the Slide is that of course our future and nature of the enterprise you can see, continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago those businesses had about 39% EBITDA, today those businesses have about 41% EBITDA.","We look at the first, in our controls and energy systems now is down to barely 10% of the company, and its organic growth was down 13%, generally the way we thought it would be. The segment while down as expected really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. Terrific profitability. You know the OP margins in this segment in the third quarter were 25.4% and the EBITDA margins were 29.2%. When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter but we don\u2019t think we are going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn\u2019t get much last year but generally it's been quite substantial. So we are sort of assuming that we won't get that this year.","Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. You know we started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP. Second quarter went to 22.5%, the third quarter is already up to 25.4% and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represent sort of a free shot on goal for us and the only represent 10% or less of revenue.","Next Slide. On the industrial technology side, you can see that this is the, fortunately, the last quarter. We will talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that\u2019s in industrial technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? Well, it happened from double-digit growth at Neptune who continues to gain market share and very strong demand for the R900 automatic meter reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades. We had a significant number of wins last quarter, over ten. And really the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last three years at Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we have done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in this space.","We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pumps and that we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite the basically that two other businesses in here that are really purely related upstream and have been severely hampered. The rest of our businesses in here, it's kind of test businesses, are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually have record quarters and on balance we don\u2019t see any deterioration in those businesses. In the fourth quarter we think we will have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we are seeing.","Next Slide. Here we look at the RF technology and software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about three legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity and then you have the tolling side of activity and then you have all this applications software business and of course now in addition to that with ConstructConnect. So here the businesses revenue was up 20% in the quarter, the operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7% but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points.","We had organic growth of 7% in the segment and had about one point of foreign exchange headwind and acquisitions helped by 14%. Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas, Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. Continues high single digit growth in software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area and that we have put together the freight matching networks of DAT in the U.S. and get loaded into a new software development. A process that\u2019s going to expand our customer base.","We had double digit growth in the RF products business. Lot of that\u2019s driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. And then toll and traffic would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll and tunnel project which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year. We had a five year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai and the Saudi project sort of back on track. We wound up with our about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter we think which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh.","In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded the $70 million plus MTA project to convert nine bridges and tunnel around five boroughs. All of you who go back and forth in that are well aware of what that\u2019s like in others, like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity technology will people to not have toll booths and there will be fines, of course based on video tolling. But if you have a normal toll tag you will be able to get through.","The growth in toll and traffic we think will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. The software business universally remains strong. We had kind of mid-single digit organic growth in the whole segment which gives really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position that we have had in the segment in a long time. And now we have acquired ConstructConnect which we will talk about here in a second, for $632 million. It's got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper type expected EBITDA margins which will get better as it gets inside the Roper to govern its process.","Next Slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day in addition to being a record quarter, it's a record number of press releases. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips and the diligence process, and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get to work in their training center and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it\u2019s just like watching the floor of the exchange with all this activity going, you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They have $55 billion of bid activity. It's just remarkable. It's like our freight matching network where something is up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds, before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network and here you are seeing all this usage around the data which is just unprecedented that is inside the network that\u2019s accessible to everybody.","So it's all cloud-based technology. The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors, form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call up is for everyone's specifications. There are also going to be benefitted by the way because they will work together with our On Center business that was just dry wall construction only. And their own niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. Those 800,000 users were laughing about this -- in preparation of the call, basically there is 800,000 people that use the bridge and tunnels in New York every day. So we have decided to, perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents the ConstructConnect user.","This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. It's revenue for next year should be something, hopefully about $150 million. It's got to generate something in the $50 million plus of EBITDA to us and remember lots of non-cash amortization in these things. So terrific cash business. It will meet all of our acquisition requirements. It's got a great management team. Dave's been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry. So he really is the domain expert. Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business. So you have all those great cash characteristics. It has deferred revenue so have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities. And that\u2019s another reason why we have found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the pre-construction industry.","Next Slide. The medical and scientific imaging business. You can see here we were up 12%. 8% on acquisition, 4% on organic. A little less than one point of negative FX but around its down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of this segment and they grew organically at 5% and interestingly throughout the year, the medical businesses have grown organically at 5%. Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software or alternate type solutions business and the medical products, all three groups grew. Sunquest, the way we look at order intake is surely different than bookings against the entire business because there are so much recurring revenue that doesn\u2019t really change from a bookings space. But on an order intake basis, they had a record and the third quarter was up by the most it's ever been.","Scientific imaging was about 15% of the segment. It did okay in the third quarter. It had modest growth but actually it's a bifurcated situation where the life science portion, because of cryo-EM market opportunities, grew over 100% in the quarter, while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak and was down about 20%. So the opportunity in front of these businesses is best it's ever been. In the fourth quarter, we think we will have continued mid-single digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the Alternate Site Solutions business.","Scientific Imaging we think will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which is another reason that you maybe get some here in the fourth quarter, we would just have to see, but we are going to assume that mostly that\u2019s going to be the first half of next year. Okay. The next Slide is the guidance update. Turning to page, here is the specifics on the guidance. We are going to go in -- for the fourth quarter we had $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range, probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and how few shares we have. So seasonality in the industrial and energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that and if get normal seasonality, then we will towards the higher end of the range.","The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There was a commitment to get the first three projects completed by January 1 and how that project ramps will have a direct effect on whether we are towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery. We talk of third quarter orders were satisfactory but not carrying immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there is some hesitancy in the industrial and energy markets about exactly when they want things that they are booked and committed to.","The full year guidance, given the fourth quarter addition to our year-to-date results, would give us somewhere around $648 million to $660 million. Most of our internal projections and external projections are on around $655 million to $660 million. Full year cash flow conversions would still be spectacular, 140% or so. And that will allow us despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year.","Next Slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Four standout businesses there. Medical software, tolling and Neptune were really quite good. Because, remember, we got 20 plus negative on the energy side of the business. EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue and our free cash flow was phenomenal.","The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel all electronic tolling project, we really expected to win this for sometime but the news about it, the commitment around it didn\u2019t come until last Friday. So we have been planning for a Q4 kick-off and we will do what we said we will do for them, which is get the first three projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect and it along with the things you can do with On Center in a cooperative way, will be very beneficial for us in 2017.","The cash performance that we have year-to-date along with a brand new balance sheet with a much better credit facility, supports our continued ability to deploy capital. It's the most powder we have ever had and eh opportunities that we see are excellent. So we had outstanding results in the third quarter and we are very well positioned for 2017 and ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital.","Andrew Krill","This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I want to start off on ConstructConnect, this is the second meaningful deal you guys have done recently in Software-as-a-Service after Aderant. So I am just wondering if you could talk about market share within construction, and if there are any unique barriers to entry versus peers for the business.","John Humphrey","Well, this is John Humphrey. So as far as barriers, I mean the barrier of course for a networks business is the strength and size of the network, and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own businesses by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. When Brian talked about 800,000 users and 55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects. I mean the size of the network and the combination that ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of iSqft, Bidclerk and Construct Data, and really turn that into a single integrated platform and that\u2019s truly unique inside the industry.","So from a competitive position. I think for most of those customers, the way that variable to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more, is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that\u2019s really the strength of that in the competitive position. There are a couple of competitors out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side, but on the network and the integrated data, we really don\u2019t think there is anyone of size there.","Andrew Krill","Okay. It is very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Do you have any sense of potential accretion and then I guess kind of where you guys that EBITDA margin could eventually go versus the sort of 33% or so you are expecting next year. Thank you.","John Humphrey","Well, we still have a lot of work to do. I mean we are going to close on the transaction but it is worth thinking about it as probably somewhere in the $0.10 to $0.15 accretive for next year. We will be able to update you on that of course as we finalize the purchase accounting. And the margin profile here is also very good, right.. We are talking about something that\u2019s already in the mid-30% EBITDA margin. And so as it continues to grow, it will grow with high incremental margins. And so that\u2019s how we see the margin progression over time as this network continues to get bigger.","Brian Jellison","I just want to add to the understanding that these acquisitions have a lot of non-cash amortization. So on a GAAP DEPS basis, people are looking at expensing that amortization and depressing what otherwise looks like earnings per share. Reality is, it will be very cash accretive. But on a GAAP DEPS basis it may only add $0.10 or $0.15. I think you get paid as a shareholder for monitoring what's happening to the quality of the cash earnings. The cash earnings of ConstructConnect will be great.","Operator","And we will move next to Robert McCarthy at Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","I guess, first, just talking about the -- again, congratulations at a very strong cash generation quarter. These questions will relate obviously to DEPS. But in terms of the medical cadence for the fourth quarter and energy, could you just expand on your comments about what kind of brought the guide down for the fourth quarter.","Brian Jellison","I think two things in terms of the DEPS. It's just our view of that is that we are not going to get much in the way of seasonality. When we look to the orders that came in the third quarter, we get a lot of footprints and we call them booked and so they are booked with a quarter, shipped within the next quarter. And we didn\u2019t see any uptick that would give us a reason to think we would have normalized Q4 seasonality, but we could be wrong about that, that would be upside that could happen to us. So, I think it's more than any one item and then we have been ready to go on a couple of projects that we expect and we are ready to [indiscernible]. Okay.","Robert McCarthy","Energy is not particularly surprising but the medical cadence. Could you just expand upon that because I think your expectation was kind of high-single-digit growth as kind of an exit rate for fourth quarter?","John Humphrey","Yes. Rob, I think you are right about that. And once again, it goes back to what Brian was talking about. When we look at the product orders, and I am talking specifically around medical products. Well, we expected that kind of last time we talked, that\u2019s exited closer to the 10% growth rate, that\u2019s existing closer to the 5% growth rate, and that combined with the timing of imaging orders and deliveries. So all the life science things that Brian talked about earlier, those are actually very sophisticated instruments and cameras and filters. They aren't as kind of the -- it's not like just machining and creating a pump. So the process in order to be able to turn that from order to delivery can easily be 60, 90, 120 days depending on yield and throughput, particularly from suppliers around some of the centers. And so as we look at the deliveries and the delivery schedule, particularly on the imaging product side and also on the medical product side, that\u2019s where we see a slight difference from what we would have thought before, but we still see this segment exiting at the mid-single-digit rate, very consistent with where it has been over the past 2.5 years.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. So you see no underlying deterioration in the core organic growth rate of that segment?","John Humphrey","No, we do not.","Brian Jellison","No, no.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then in terms of the M&A pipeline, obviously you have transacted on a very interesting deal this quarter. But I mean what's the state of play in terms of how you look over the next, kind of 12 to 18 months in terms of capacities of these deals and the environment to get deals done. Because it has been, in the main, kind of a difficult environment to get deals done.","Brian Jellison","Yes. You know if you go back to January '15, in that 21-month period we have deployed $2.7 billion in capital. I mean in the next 21 month period or much sooner I would think that that kind of run rates are impossible. You know we have got hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of capital to be able to put to work and getting the new $2.5 billion revolver which is [on ] [ph] done, was a big deal because it's given us some flexibility around how much we can deploy at anyone point in time and that\u2019s very helpful. So there are a number of small deals that we are engaged with at the moment and a couple of larger transactions which would be even bigger than ConstructConnect that we are involved with, we think are very attractive. So you never know, in terms of your word, cadence, how that will happen. But I would be very very surprised if we didn\u2019t deploy that capital in the next 12 months.","Robert McCarthy","The final question is just around, you have heard this many times, but would you consider doing something akin to what some of your competitors have done, simply not competitors but public comps, in terms of perhaps just shifting to EPS excluding amortization.","Brian Jellison","Well, there's a lot of smiling in the room because that\u2019s the proper way to measure us. I guess we are not interested in stepping on the SEC. Those people that are doing that, they can continue to do it for a longer period of time and if the SEC doesn\u2019t say anything about it, that\u2019s a smart thing to do, because it's the proper way to measure the business. It's just not the way GAAP measures the earnings. So we had $50 million of amortization in the third quarter and what do we have, 101 million or 102 million of shares, you can do the math. I am apparently now allowed to say what that math generates. EBITA, earnings per share for the company will be and are spectacular.","Robert McCarthy","Brian, you would have banging my head against the wall for that for about 15 years and I am a slow learner. So I will leave it there.","Operator","We will move to our next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen and Company.","Joseph Giordano","Do you get the sense that given where rates are and when you are looking at deals, are you having to stretch a little bit more in terms of multiple because competitors who are looking at the same assets are able to kind of do some funny math with rates being here in terms of returns?","Brian Jellison","Well, I wish it were funny math but it isn't funny math. The difference is, we don't like to go above like four times debt to EBITDA, and those guys are willing to take [that staples] [ph] and banks put on things in non-bank entities, but [on times] [ph] at eight times EBITDA, right. So, they don't deploy much more equity in a transaction that we do, we just don't want to have seven or eight times debt to EBITDA. We are going to remain investment grade and to do that you want to be around four times debt to EBITDA coming back to 3 or 3.5 or something. So you know we are very disciplined about wanting to and guaranteeing ourselves to maintain investment grade status.","The prices that people are paying for things are really bifurcated. Oddly enough, the industrial assets are trading at really more than they're worth in a normalized interest environment in the M&A world, because they don't have a lot of EBITDA even though they all require a lot of capital spending to maintain that EBITDA. So those multiples are interestingly high. Then the asset light business trade at a premium to that but the arbitrage for us on the asset light businesses is more favorable than those people that are buying the more capital intensive businesses. So something like ConstructConnect, it will be a long-term compounder of investment for us which is great as opposed to the guys that are buying the capital intensive businesses thinking that, gee, you know, it looks like I'm paying a lot but there is the nature of their cyclical activity and when there is this higher number, this will happen. We will leave that field to everybody else. It is not where we're going.","Joseph Giordano","Thank you. I just wanted to touch on Neptune as well. I mean the results this quarter, obviously very, very strong. There's this story out there, that has been out there for a while, fair or not, about a lack of investment. You talk about $50 million of M&A. Can you just talk about your positioning there on the highest technology type products, like on the AMI development and how you're capitalizing on your installed base? I mean the numbers speak for themselves but this has kind of been out there for a while and I guess, maybe give you guys a chance to address that.","Brian Jellison","Yes. I think $50 million was what we have done in R&D, not M&A.","Joseph Giordano","Sorry if I misspoke. Yes.","Brian Jellison","In the last three years we have put $50 million of work there. We are also opening a new software development center for Neptune that will really help us and a lot of things we're doing. So we're not going to provide a lot of information about what we're doing but I can just suggest you that we have the best reading technology that\u2019s available and has the highest integrity results. We have an enormous installed base and maybe people forget that the way our 900 product works, we can upgrade that, the AMI status. And there is a lot of ways to collect the technology but if you have got the right core unit that can use multiple ways of gathering the data, you will be a little bit ahead of the game. So we are able to do upgrades for people in the AMI arena that they always, if they ever migrated to it, they do that and we have won a lot of those. Over $30 million of that just in the third quarter.","You saw other things. Mobile activity, you see Verizon picking us as the person that they are working with development on mobile technology. So there's a lot of different things going on and we are not going to provide more information than we have around that but Neptune will have record performance in 2016. So if anybody thought it didn't have some kind of long term reason for performing well, explain to me why they are growing so much.","Joseph Giordano","Fair enough. And last if I could, John, you talked last quarter about, we were talking about Sunquest, some small hospitals, they were taking maybe [indiscernible] and you said that made sense for that size of a customer and your core being large hospitals. Can you just talk about how that went through 3Q? Is that kind of stabilized and then the customer base that you focused on, you remain to be -- the capture rate there is being consistent.","John Humphrey","Yes. It has been consistent. And you are absolutely right, in fact Brian talked about the order intake, right. So remember that fully two-thirds, if not more, of Sunquest revenue is recurring revenue in terms of maintenance on installed software that's already been out there. And so when we look at the order intake, it's a much smaller piece of their total revenue buy. But when they look at their order intake which is about the new Lab 8.0, it's about the new blood bank solution, it's the new outreach solution. So the nurses can start the testing process right at the bedside and be able to start that data flow and workflow to the lab right from the bedside. So all of those upgrades are driving that order intake to be a record level for the third quarter. It is true that on the lower end, the smaller hospitals and integrated solution can make economic sense for them, but the competitive environment and the solution that Sunquest delivers is, it continues to be very good and our competitive position continues to be very strong, particularly in those larger hospitals.","Operator","And we will go next to Brian Gesuale at Raymond James.","Brian Gesuale","I am wondering if you could expand a little bit on Sunquest. You talked about record orders. Maybe just the richness of this product upgrade cycle that we have seen and maybe give us a little bit of a preface as what we might expect in 2017.","Brian Jellison","I think it's early to talk about 2017. We actually have a review coming up with Sunquest in about a month. So we will be talking about not only 2017 but importantly 2018 and 2019, and the plans that they have around the investments there. So one is what I was kind of just mentioning in terms of the continued on the upgrade side around Lab 8.0 and the new blood bank solution. But also wouldn\u2019t ignore the investments that we have made around genetic testing and the workflows associated with that. So you really have the blood side which is the core lab, high volume testing environment that every hospital has to have. And I think of the other side, which is the anatomic technology and the emerging genetic workflows around genetic testing.","That\u2019s where we have made important investments with the acquisition of GeneInsight and continued R&D around to be able to make that workflow as efficient and as quick with getting information back to the doctor as timely as happens today on the blood side. And so for all those reasons, I think the Sunquest and our entire platform of hospital software solutions, which of course includes Data Innovations and CliniSys, and GeneInsight and a variety of other things, all of those businesses really deliver those software solutions to hospitals. I think there future looks very bright as a result of the investments that we continue to make there.","Brian Gesuale","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A pipeline. It sounds robust. You certainly have a lot of dry powder. Can you maybe talk about the quality of those deals? This ConstructConnect looks very asset light, negative working capital. It appears that the quality is actually increasing as the pipeline is. Could you maybe discuss that?","John Humphrey","Yes. You can really see that when you look at that net working capital chart where you are down 5.8, people think you could never get lower and now we are 1.9. Certainly a lot of that as you get deferred revenue and you get paid in advance for work you do and most of the things that we look at these days have those qualities. So I thought, we get to zero ultimately negative at some point but I don\u2019t see us going up. The amount of small niche businesses that work in kind of oligopolies where customer [indiscernible] is critical and then those that have the ability to have kind of a network effect, there are most of those things out there than you might imagine. Because when you are focused on product businesses, you don\u2019t necessarily see some of these kind of things. But all of the people that are involved in transactions and banking businesses and then private equity businesses, kind of meddle what we favor, what we look like. And so the funnel what we have of incoming opportunity is really amazing. And just incumbent on us to sort through that funnel, find the best management teams. So that\u2019s the end market opportunities that are in favorably competitive environments. And believe me, there is more high quality things available that our balance sheet could tolerate. Fortunately, we have got a big enough balance sheet to capture some of them.","Operator","We will take our next question from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Brian, could you just talk for a minute or two about the New York MTA contract. I think you had mentioned there sites should be performed in the fourth quarter, kind of accelerated. Given the size of that contract, are we talking about maybe $20 million to $25 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and then the balance of the sites, the other six sites, does that all fall into the first half of '17?","Brian Jellison","No. No. I think commitment in the contract is pretty specific in terms of what they've been willing to release. And it will be done by November of 2017, is what we're told. There was really even one -- remember you have got the, like ramp, right. So we've been doing some engineering work with them to assure that the overhead kiosk and everything that were being built-in, are going to be okay. So it will start slow. I don't know, maybe we could get $10 million in the fourth quarter of revenue that we have with the rest being -- whatever is it, it's about $72 million for the entire period and it will be really up to them at the pace they want us to do the installation and release of the technology.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Understood. And just then just a last question, I have, just around MHA. There is a lot of noise around drug pricing, both generic as well as branded. And then also I noticed in the Slide that you had, that there was a suggestion that the alternative site solutions business would kind of be a leader here in the fourth quarter. Can you just kind of pull all that together? Has the noise around drug pricing impacted just the revenue stream in the pasture there at MHA, and then also is this alternative site solutions business being kind of the fourth quarter leader? Is there timing there or is there contract renewals or what would drive that in the fourth quarter?","John Humphrey","Yes. Sure. So in terms of its contribution on the growth side, it was up in the 3% or 4% in the third quarter and we expect that to be modestly better in the fourth quarter. From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean you are right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing are really targeted for our being sold to the senior population. Remember MHA is around alternate site healthcare and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that are being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles.","So, we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past but still positive in 2016. We're not counting on an awful lot of drug pricing lift as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand in their solutions in non-drug supply chains, including food and other things around long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that. And then they also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You have seen us make a couple of acquisitions that also serve the alternate site healthcare which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those members and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance, although it does have an impact on our revenue.","Operator","And we will go next to Alex Blanton at Clear Harbor Asset Management. Mr. Blanton, your line is open.","Brian Jellison","Audra, we will have to follow up with Alex, I think.","Operator","All right. And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to management for any closing remarks.","Brian Jellison","Well, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you again in about three months.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation."],"18888":["Roper Industries (NYSE:ROP) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 29, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Brian D.

I will now turn the conference over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.","John Humphrey","Thank you, Kayla, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our first quarter. Joining me this morning is: Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Jason Conley, who heads up Planning and Investor Relations.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.","Now if you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.","Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation and on our website.","For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is a fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $3.6 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business.","And now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, I will turn -- sorry, to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?","Brian D. Jellison","Thank you, John, and good morning, everybody. If we look at the Q1 enterprise financial results, it was an all-time record for the first quarter, most level of orders, highest level of sales, biggest net earnings, the most EBITDA and the highest operating and free cash flow. One of the incredible things about the first quarter is that all of our margins again increased, gross margins, the operating margin, the EBITDA margin and the net earning margins, all established records for Roper.","Our orders at $794 million are particularly strong in that last year we had about $15 million out of the Neptune cancellation, which of course, didn't recur, making that $794 million look even stronger on a comparative basis. Revenue was $741 million and our book-to-bill was 1.07, which is well above our norm.","We have a little over $1 billion in backlog now, which is up 18% over last year at this time. Our gross margin went up 240 basis points to 57.4%. And all 4 segments actually increased their gross margin, so it's not just the benefit of higher margin of Sunquest but execution in all 4 segments.","Operating margins were up 150 basis points to 25.5%. And our EBITDA reached $230 million in the quarter, which was up 210 basis points to 31%, which is a quite excellent performance for our first quarter. Our GAAP operating cash flow was $171 million, representing 23% of revenue. Compare that $171 million to $125 million of net earnings. The free cash flow was $160 million in the first quarter and our diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.27. We felt we had really compelling margins and cash flow, and then the Q1 orders will really drive our full year organic growth.","Next slide. Here, we look at the Q1 income statement. Couple of things here. In the orders, you can see overall orders for the company were up 9%, organic was up 1%. But if you adjust for the $15 million Neptune cancellation, that contract cancellation, organic would have been up 3%, which may explain our tone about feeling better about orders and organic growth for the balance of the year.","Revenue, which was at $741 million, was up 4%; organic, posted down 3%, but most all of that is this Neptune cancellation, again it's over 2%. And the residual was just the continuing softness in the imaging businesses that we expected. So the core really was flat to modest growth on revenue without those 2 particular items.","Gross margin, as we said before, up 240 basis points to 57.4% from 55% last year with each segment increasing their margins. Operating profit was up by $19 million on a $3 million [ph] revenue variance, so our leverage was above 60%. And that included greater than $1 million charge in deal costs we incurred in the quarter but aren't calling out as a separate item for a one-timer. Operating margin, you can see, was up 150 basis points from 24% to 25.5%. Interest was up 6%, as we're paying for the interest related to the new bond offering last year and the interest costs for Sunquest. Other expenses, we had a negative experience at $2.5 million, mostly FX-driven item here. So that $2.5 million plus the $1 million on the deal cost was about a $3.5 million drag. Fortunately, we had a benefit from our tax rate, with about half of that coming from the R&D and other extenders from 2012. And that gave us the net earnings of $1.27.","Next slide. If you look at the EBITDA growth, 2 years ago, our trailing EBITDA at the end of the first quarter was $685 million. Last year, it was $830 million. And this year, we're already up to $950 million on a trailing basis. No pro forma in that, that's just the number. So we're up $265 million in just 2 years. And then if you look at our margin performance on EBITDA, 2 years ago, it was 27.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. Last year, it was 29%. And this year, it closes out at 31.3% and will continue to expand, up 390 basis points in just 2 years. So it's really extraordinary performance on an EBITDA and margin basis by any measure.","Next slide. Our Q1 cash flow, it's again remarkable and it continues to grow as a function of revenue. We had $171 million of operating cash flow. If you divide that by the net earnings, you can see the conversion was 137%. We had $160 million in free cash flow, which is 22% of revenue. And the cash conversion is at 128%. It's really across-the-board improvement in every segment, certainly a record. You can see our cash flow -- free cash flow in the quarter at $160 million is twice what it was 2 years ago at $78 million. And below, you can see the percent of revenue. As I said, cash flow as a function of revenue continues to escalate. 2 years ago, it was 12.1%; a year ago, 18.5%; and this year, 21.7%.","Next slide. We'll get into the individual details, a lot of moving parts here. So let's turn to the first one, which is Energy Systems & Controls. I think these are kind of in order of revenue or orders, so energy system being our smallest segment now at 20%. Here, you had orders up modestly about $4 million, revenue down a little bit and gross margin increased from 54.1% to 55.6%, up 150 basis points. On the items in the quarter, our compressor controls business continues to capture growth. They're benefiting from global project rollouts that had a lot of visibility, too, for the balance of the year and continued to increase their field engineering billable time for people.","Next point is that the lower gas rig count reduced revenue for our engine safety systems businesses and some other people that are in that category. That was about a $3 million drag in the quarter. And the industrial end markets were soft as it related to any instruments and pretty good on consumables. That was another $2 million drag. Margin expansion from the growth in the higher-margin areas and benefits from second half 2012 cost actions helped us out. And you can see the book-to-bill for the segment was 1.08, which is quite strong.","In the second quarter, we would expect relatively flat revenue in the energy systems business but higher margins. And then in the second half of the year, we see higher revenue growth with compressor controls really driving a big part of that, and then more favorable comps for some of the other energy categories. And we're getting -- starting to see what will be a ramping early adoption of some new products around sensor technology that we're introducing in control systems.","Next slide. Here, we'll look at Industrial Technology. While revenue was down, virtually the whole variance is simply the Neptune contract cancellation. That was $15 million and revenue was down about $13 million. So we had flattish revenue exclusive of that. We had very strong growth in our U.S. water meter sales, which was better than expected, that double-digit growth in water meter sales. And that really offset the drag we had in our material analysis business, where we had instrument sales decline somewhat with consumables being steady. But net-net, the contract cancellation wasn't able -- we weren't able to overcome that with other organic growth.","The fluid handling, we had growth in certain niche markets that mitigated the gas drilling activity. The gas drilling activity did hurt our Cornell Pump business a little bit, but the other businesses were strong. Book-to-bill was virtually flat at 0.99. Gross margins expanded in the industrial segment even without the revenue growth. They went from 50.6% up to 51.2%, so a 60 basis point increase. And those very few businesses that delevered did so at a very modest leverage rate.","For the second quarter, we would expect similar market conditions, although we will get sequential growth from the first quarter. We still have the Neptune headwind for another quarter. It was $15 million in Q1. It's going to be about $12 million in Q2. As we get into the second half, that dissipates. So we're back on a normal basis. And you'll see better-looking ratio numbers on the growth pattern.","Fluid handling growth in directional drilling is assured. We've got strong incoming orders and demand for products in that arena. And the energy markets are improving very modestly. Our material analysis comps are going to be relatively easy for us to lap, so we expect to do better there. And the Neptune headwind in the second half, it eases to a single-digit number in Q3, and then 0 in Q4. So that will help us. And our distributor network around water meter sales is continuing to grow as housing continues stronger than it was in the past.","Next slide. If we look at the RF Technology segment, very strong performance here, orders are up $36 million. We had great segment orders, led by toll and traffic, where segment orders were up 18% over the prior year. Two really important projects that we'll have delivery throughout the year but kind of tailored to the end of the year with the Florida Department of Transportation tag upgrade project, and then Virginia's I-66 highway system.","We had revenue growth in toll and traffic projects in the first quarter, which offset lower tag shipments, which were lower than a year ago. And project execution, as we've made some considerable upgrades in the people side at TransCore, certainly paying dividends as we see better operational performance. In fact, the segment overall gross margins went up from 51.8% last year to 53.9% this year, so they're up 210 basis points. We had some growth again in our freight match and iTrade U.S. businesses on subscriber subscriptions. And our book-to-bill, you can see, is exceptionally strong at 1.15.","For the remainder of the year, we see this backlog really positioning us for an assured amount of organic growth in toll and traffic. And then our CBORD cashless systems and integrated security wins, which we're confident about, will also drive growth. We've just won in April a Technolog contract award for gas AMR. This is going to be in the U.K. It will drive improved second half performance for us. It's a 5-year contract and the terms aren't ready to be disclosed. But it will certainly add to our growth profile in the second half of the year.","And then our Inovonics brand businesses, who make wireless sensors for security and senior care and submetering, are doing dramatically better this year. There were better in the first quarter. And we expect them to be substantially better in the latter part of the year, particularly in our senior care applications and submetering as multifamily housing continues to strengthen. And we'll get some continued modest growth in our subscriber bases in our SaaS businesses at the freight matching and iTrade.","Next slide. If we look at Medical & Scientific Imaging, a huge increase in orders, up $59 million. And of course, some of that is Sunquest. Nonetheless, revenue was up 25% over the prior year and operating profit is up 46% over the prior year. And operating margins, on what used to be our most difficult segment, from an OP viewpoint, are up 450 basis points to 31.1%. And our gross margins in the quarter increased by 270 basis points over last year.","So we look at the specific items. Sunquest is on plan. They have favorable order rates, so they're ahead on orders. We do need to increase our ability to get faster implementation processes in place, which we've been talking to them about. Because we have an opportunity to increase our growth beyond their original expectations if we can get the implementation processes to happen faster. We continue to have very weak research markets. And those continue to negatively impact us. In fact, in the quarter, that was a $12 million headwind, and it's hard to make that up. We had a very difficult comp at Gatan because they had kind of a blowout first quarter last year. But the core problem remains very modest activity in the camera borses [ph] with the research funding around the world. Medical devices were a little bit soft as it related to direct sales to U.S. hospitals, but consumable sales were quite good. So on balance, that came out fine. Our book-to-bill for the segment was 1.06.","In the second half of the year, medical is going to be led by this faster uptick on the Sunquest implementation execution. It's the only thing that wouldn't be driving greater growth. And so we're very focused on seeing that improve. It's not bad, it's just that it could be better because we're getting a lot of new business on the adoption of software upgrades for Sunquest. And the speed at which we can recognize that revenue is directly related to our execution capability and the implementation.","We had strength -- in the second half, we're going to have strength in CIVCO's applications. Remember, that's a multimodality business. In radiation oncology, we have some new products that are coming to play, so they'll add some growth in the second half. And while the research markets remain challenging, they have easier comps for scientific imaging in the second half than they did in the first half. And then the MHA acquisition will add substantially to our growth. And I've asked John Humphrey to talk through the nature of MHA, and then I'll talk a bit about why we thought it was a great acquisition. So John?","John Humphrey","Thank you, Brian. Next slide, going to the MHA overview slide. So talk a little bit about this acquisition, which we do expect to close later in the week. So all the regulatory approval has already been obtained on that. So MHA is the largest provider of services and technology and a network for the alternate site health care markets. An alternate site, for those of you on the phone, just means nonhospital settings. So all the places where care is being delivered in a nonacute care, nonhospital type of setting.","What they really provide is a whole suite of tools and technologies, which include GPO services, includes reimbursement tools, software specific to pharmacy solutions and the largest network for processing and adjudicating Medicare Part D claims, and they provide that for all of their customers across multiple classes of trade. And those are delivered with the largest and most comprehensive customer service team, which enables their customers to both increase revenue through getting better reimbursements and faster reimbursements and also to lower costs by being able to purchase more effectively and efficiently across the network that MHA is able to provide to them. They do have the #1 position in all of their served niche markets, which include long-term care pharmacists, home infusion, specialty pharmacy, assisted living locations, all of the places where care is being delivered in a nonhospital setting.","Next slide. Going into a few more of the kind of facts and figures for MHA. When we talk about it being the largest alternate site health care network, this really gives a glimpse of the scale that MHA has with a customer base of about 12,000 different customers, 47,000 different locations. And they enable the purchasing volume for all of those current locations, which exceeds $5 billion annually. And MHA is able to have a share in that, and that's how they're able to generate revenue.","And as I said, they do process almost 35% of all Medicare Part D claims in the country with the network that they're providing for their customers. Over 120 million annual pharmacy and drug interactions that are being analyzed and delivered and the large customer service workforce. And that workforce is more than just sales people. They really act as consultants that enables their customer success, so they're able to run the business more effectively. And that high degree of customer intimacy is one of the sustainable real advantages that MHA has in the marketplace.","On the right side, you can see the breakdown of the customers and the end markets that they're serving. About half of their customers are in long-term care pharmacy. The long-term care facility, that also includes assisted living centers. And that's generally around food that's being purchased but also other things in those long-term care facilities. The alternate site care includes such thing as specialty pharmacy, home infusion, respiratory therapy, et cetera. And then that other smaller slice that says technology is really the network and the other software and enabling tools that MHA is providing to its customers that allows them to run their business more effectively.","Now the end market that we see here has a number of very durable and diverse growth drivers, including favorable demographic trends. Except for the people on the phone, everyone else in the country is getting a little older. And these alternate site care markets are in low-cost care setting. So as more care is being delivered outside of the hospital setting, that's a favorable trend that's impacting this end market. And we continue to expect to see market share gains based upon the value, the scale that MHA has in the classes of trade that they serve and the strong customer service, high intimacy consulting type of sales process that they have. And this niche market still provides what we think are very complementary acquisition opportunities. MHA has done a few of those in their history, and we would expect to continue that process as we go forward.","So there's a couple of slides about MHA, who they are, who they serve and what they provide. And I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk a little bit about the acquisition and how it fits.","Brian D. Jellison","Thanks, John. People always ask us about what our criteria for acquisitions are. And we -- virtually every presentation, we will tell you that these are the things that we're looking at. And just as a reminder, these are the things we look at.","So if you look at the first item, we want our businesses to be asset-light. Many people report EBITDA, and they don't even take the time to tell you what the EBITDA minus CapEx is. And they'll talk about depreciation and CapEx as though it's unimportant. We think asset velocity is extremely important. So in the case of MHA, they have no inventory. That would be 0, nada. And they have negative working capital. So the cash-on-cash growth out of MHA is really quite substantial because it's going to throw off additional cash that we're going to be able to use to acquire companies to augment its own growth.","We're going to -- we always want to focus on market structure and driving forces. We invested more money and diligence on MHA than any deal we've ever had, with 3 different outside people approaching this from very different directions. And we've been looking at this company for quite a long time, waiting to pull the trigger based on a variety of factors. And this research was critically important to us to just see how secure their strategy is and that there aren't externalities that could come out of the woodwork that would be difficult for us.","On customer intimacy and technology, we want those to drive the purchase decision, and we were very impressed. When John talks about the consulting nature, these people virtually prepare for their clients a 3-ring binder that they go through to kind of tell them how they're performing and where they can make decisions that will add to their margins. And these guys that they're serving work on such slim margins that a basis point change could be the difference between whether they're cash-positive or cash-negative.","Management continuity we always value. And in this case, the entire team is coming along. Mike Sicilian is going to run this business. I and his team are on board. In fact, as we say, we like to have incentives linked to commitments from the team. And in this case, we have a 3-year forward execution goals in place already with Mike's team.","We like to still focus on the cubby [ph] idea of preserving core values and stimulating progress. And in this case, the core values at MHA are really outstanding. They have great people and they provide great service. But we're going to be able to get them access to customers and complementary people that we currently do business with in our software activity, both in RF and in medical, which should be quite helpful to Mike as he continues to grow his business.","And then grow what you buy. Well, one of the immediate benefits you get from our ownership is that MHA customers can have much better confidence now because they have a strong company behind it instead of it being a private equity situation. Customers don't have to worry about who might own it in the future and whether that's in or not in their best interest. And they can really focus now on executing long-range strategies, knowing that they have a permanent home. And they really are, both from a cultural viewpoint and end market viewpoint, a great addition to our medical family.","Next slide. So here, we take a look at the 2013 guidance. Next slide. The full year non-GAAP DEPS guidance we're increasing from $5.60 on the low range to $5.76 and from $5.82 on the top to $5.94. That really comes about -- we have $0.05 of negative currency using our 3\/31 currency versus what we said at 12\/31. So that's a negative $0.05. And then we have a positive $0.14 on the low end for MHA and a positive $0.17 on the high end. We raised the low end higher because really the quality of our orders and delivery gives us very little doubt about the low end compared to where we were at the beginning of the year when we had the $5.60.","Tax rate for the rest of the year, unfortunately, it's going to be in this 31% category. MHA is a high tax base business as is Sunquest. Both those continue to grow, and they add several basis points to our tax rate.","Sales guidance, we said at the beginning of the year, we thought we could do somewhere between 8% and 10% of revenue with about 5% of that coming from Sunquest, meaning about 3% to 5% in organic. And we don't see any reason we can't still do the 3% to 5% organic. So we're raising our sales guidance to 11% to 13% for the year, with some of that coming from MHA. And I think that's -- should really -- we're just quite comfortable with those numbers despite a little softness in the first quarter. And I think if you look at the numbers without remembering that you had a $15 million divot from the contract cancellation in the first quarter and a $12 million divot in the second, you might think it's softer than it is.","Q2 non-GAAP DEPS is going to be $1.26 to $1.30. The only way that would improve is if some of these projects for the second half moved into the second quarter. But we don't have any reason to believe they will but they could. We're going to have a much stronger Q3 and Q4. A little bit more EPS coming in the second half of the year from a linearity viewpoint than normal, but that's due to the nature of the things that have happened in the first half of the year in our acquisitions. For our full year, the GAAP operating cash flow, we've raised the guidance to exceed $800 million. And that's fairly prestigious cash flow, we would say. And then we are reminding people in our press release in here that all of the MHA items will be non-GAAP.","Next slide. Here, if we look at the Q1 summary then, we really have had compelling results on all the margins, the cash flow. The niche markets continued to separate Roper from any of these traditional or perceived peers that people used to talk about for Roper. For us, it's always frustrating. Some guy, \"It's a machinery company.\" My goodness, it's certainly not a machinery company, it's an selectable products company. We don't have a single business that's in the NAICS [ph] code electrical products. I mean, this is a diversified growth company getting more diversified with each acquisition, with the biggest piece of our activity now centered around medical and radio frequency and software technologies.","We've achieved record first quarter results in all of these different categories. Our book-to-bill was 1.07 with a backlog up 18% to $1 billion. Our gross margin, as we said, was up 240 basis points to 57.4% and all 4 segments were up. Operating margin, up 150 basis points; EBITDA, up 210 basis points to $230 million; and operating cash flow coming in at 23% of revenue; and free cash flow at 22% of revenue with 128% cash conversion. MHA will close this week. With any luck, it will close on May 1.","And we're really now positioned to capture organic growth for the rest of the year. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For MHA, maybe some additional color on their mix, some sense of how or what percent of their contracts are exclusive. And maybe talk a bit about how much of the revenue comes from performance contracts and how they've done against those historically.","John Humphrey","Yes. So none of their contracts are performance-based. Most of the things you're talking about, this idea of exclusivity is more of acute care hospital type of GPO -- I mean, very little as far as MHA's contracts with their customers are exclusive and none of them are performance-based.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then Brian, I was hoping you can expand on -- and maybe this is just the terminology. But on Sunquest, when you talked about you're looking for faster implementation, is this -- are you talking about integration, new software rollouts? Or just if you could expand on that point.","Brian D. Jellison","Yes. The integration is fine. It's just a world-class organization, and we've had nothing but a marvelous time working with the Sunquest people. But the adoption of the software upgrades that they're getting is occurring at a faster pace, I think, than they expected. And as a result, their ability to execute against those and get the implementation needs to improve. And they're making some structural changes around people and who's driving what so that they can get better focus on that because we could actually escalate their growth if we can get out there to get those new customers onboard. It's a customer integration, not a Roper to Sunquest integration question.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just to clarify on that, what is the growth rate that you're expecting from Sunquest if you factor in these new software upgrades?","Brian D. Jellison","I think we're expecting it to grow at sort of high single-digits.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what type of margins that you've been -- you're getting out of the blocks?","Brian D. Jellison","I'd say they're maybe twice ours.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","One follow-up on MHA, and then I have another question. John or Brian, can you talk about the addressable market size for MHA, the competitive environment, whether you see any disruptive technologies out there to what MHA has?","John Humphrey","We see a lot of disruptive technologies and saw them all during our diligence process. I mean, they have a very high share, and particularly in the long-term care pharmacy space, yes, well north of 50% there. But it's still -- they have the largest share also in the long-term care facilities around food purchasing, but that's a relatively small share. So there's still quite a bit of headroom to grow in the long-term care facility and assisted living areas. And then we just see the positive drivers associated with demographic trends and more care being delivered in nonhospital settings as population ages. So those are positive benefits. And then those share gains, particularly on the LTCF side of their business, are things that we think will drive their growth going forward.","Brian D. Jellison","I think, Matt, that John means that the disruptors that he sees are at MHA, which is...","John Humphrey","Yes, that is what I meant.","Brian D. Jellison","We're seeing a pretty clear pathway of growth there. And we're enabling a lot of people to be successful in a marketplace that probably wouldn't be able to survive without the productivity that MHA allows them to deliver.","John Humphrey","That's right.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then my for my follow-up, just, Brian, can help fill in the blanks a little bit on the organic growth forecast? You start out minus 3%. It sounds to me like you weren't specific, but the second quarter is maybe relatively flattish. That really does imply a pretty big finish to the year. Can you just sort of help bridge how Roper gets there?","John Humphrey","Sure. I mean, yes, you're right, as far as the math and the way that it rolls out. So with kind of down 3% in the first quarter, we're expecting second quarter to be up kind of in the low single-digit range on an organic basis, 1%, 2%, 3%. And then the back half is in the high single-digit range, driven by the orders that we received in the first quarter. So that provides a nice backlog and contracts and projects to execute against in the RF segment. And then just some modestly improving areas, some new product introductions, and frankly, a little bit of easier comps as we get toward Q3 and Q4 in some of the imaging and industrial segments.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a couple of questions, gents. Just again on MHA, is that $95 million EBITDA number inclusive of the D&A that gets created by your acquisition of the company? Or is that its own underlying EBITDA?","John Humphrey","It's actually both. So we will have incremental amortization, obviously, of the intangibles upon acquisition. But the earnings before that amortization and interest in other things is consistent between our ownership and theirs. And just to clarify that $95 million is under the first 12 months of our ownership, not for the calendar year of '13.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So you're saying the additional DA created by your acquisition doesn't -- isn't significant relative to that $95 million number?","John Humphrey","Right. Yes. So we've got the $95 million of EBITDA. And then we're right now estimating that the amortization on an annual basis will be something around $25 million.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And that's included in the $95 million?","John Humphrey","Right. Well, it's actually excluded from the $95 million, so the $95 million is before the amortization. So if you add any amortization, it comes down to $75 million or $70 million.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got it. And just trying to ballpark the revenues of the business, I guess, at the midpoint of your revenue range is you've raised revenues by 3 percentage points, which is $90 million or so for a partial year. You've got some FX headwinds and other things going on. But we're talking about a business that's, I don't know, $130 million, $150 million in revenues. Is that the right ballpark?","John Humphrey","Yes. That's a fair assessment.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then finally, I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail on how the deal pipeline looks now. This was obviously a very significant deal with the pipeline still active. Should we expect anything else this year of this size? Any general color would be appreciated.","Brian D. Jellison","Well, I think a couple of years ago, we said we already knew where the next $5 billion of investment would be. It's just that you never know whether you're going to close the gap or things work out. In this case, having done Sunquest at $1.4 billion in August and MHA at $1 billion this month, at $2.5 billion, we're sort of halfway there. We're hoping that things that we would like to do are still going to be available to us over the next 2 or 3 years. So I don't think there's any question. We've still got another $2.5 billion or $3 billion to go. But I don't think much of that would be this year.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on that organic growth question from earlier, clearly the book-to-bill was strong this quarter, 1.07. What kind of confidence and visibility do you have into that back half of the year growth forecast? And then are there any specific areas where you have concerns in the back half of the year, given what you've seen and what has been a relatively slower growth environment this quarter?","John Humphrey","Yes. That's a really good question. So the areas that we have the best visibility into are the ones where we also had some of the best order growth this quarter. So in the RF segment, which has a little bit longer lead time between order receipt and revenue and project execution, so that's the area that I would say that we probably have the highest degree of confidence in, because most of what we're going to be shipping out and delivering in the back half is largely in backlog already today. And then as we kind of step away from that and see that one of the areas where we have a little bit less visibility because we're faster between order to delivery, those areas are more in our industrial and energy markets. And so we have a number of things that are going on there. Our compressor controls is very similar to RF in terms of its backlog and visibility. But some of the other areas there, it's not unusual to have a order to revenue cycle that would be measured in weeks, not months. But we do have visibility in terms of the new products that we're introducing and what we expect the uptake rate to be there. But I wouldn't say that our view on the second half, as we stand here today, is any different than our view would have been on the second half as we stood here at this time last year. So we have similar visibility today as we would at any other time as we look 6 to 9 months out. And that kind of tries to give some sense of where we have better visibility and things that still have to happen in order to achieve our earnings guidance for the year.","Brian D. Jellison","Let me just add to that, Joe, that the -- our book and ship businesses actually did quite fine. And our book and ship businesses are motoring along. What we wanted to see and we were fortunate to have it occur is that these longer lead time businesses, which really are compressor control and our toll and traffic businesses, in some cases CBORD projects, all are coming in favorably now. That's where -- there was more risk in those things for the year than there are in some of these book and ship businesses. And our bellwethers that would worry us, that would say there's some weakness -- are seeing some of that on the instrument side that's CapEx-related but not anything on the service and parts and consumable side. So we -- that's the reason we were willing to stick with the organic guidance we had here when we raised our overall sales to 11% to 13% for the year.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful color, guys. I guess, one follow-up is given that we have had a little bit of a slower growth environment, has there been any adjustments that you've had to make to your portfolio, either adjusting the cost structure in any way to try to navigate through these relatively uncertain paths? Or has the portfolio essentially been -- remained intact over the past quarter or 2?","John Humphrey","Well, in terms of the portfolio meaning the businesses, they've remained intact. We haven't really done anything about exiting a category. We did a very modest amount of restructuring in the third quarter of last year and even a little less in the fourth quarter. Most of that was in the energy business, which is why energy's first quarter had higher margins and why we're seeing they'll have still higher margins again sequentially in the second quarter. Those businesses that were down, and they were only a few, the big down is just this contract cancellation that -- going through the pipeline here. And so the others aren't down all that much. Where they are down, they're deleveraging at about 30% with gross margins at 50%. So that would tell you that their costs are quite fine in terms of being in line. And since we don't have a lot of heavy assets, if we had to make an adjustment, we can be very nimble compared to most other people because most of our assets go home at night.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So if we're talking about high single-digits in the second half, would it be fair to be thinking about RF as double-digits? Or presumably somewhere there's low double-digits in there and just wondering if we could go a little deeper into any such component.","Brian D. Jellison","Yes. It would be safe to say that RF will lead the organic growth profile by a wide margin. You'll get -- you'll struggle to get past mid-digits in industrial and you'll get high single-digits in energy and medical, and double-digits in RF.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the medical, high single organic can -- what's at the forefront of that? Is there any research improvement or budget flush that you're kind of putting into that?","John Humphrey","It's all relative.","Brian D. Jellison","That's true. It is just relative. The situation there is you do have easier comps for the research market businesses. But we're not expecting anything great out of those. It's just a little better. And they did have a weaker Q1. And what really happens in the medical segment is in the fourth quarter, Sunquest becomes organic. So we acquired it in August, so it's finally going to lap itself and it will drive some additional growth in that segment.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And then just overall in the quarter versus where you came into it, what was the 1 or 2 biggest surprises?","Brian D. Jellison","I think even though we're down 3% organically, it's really all just this contract situation, getting rid of that. And the imaging, which we expected to be soft, I think we were generally encouraged that the consumption stuff with consumables in those businesses that were weaker with instruments was as strong as it was. So it's not suggesting that people are slowing down their activity but maybe postponing their purchases. Our stuff tends to be above MRO and below capital spending. But it's easy to defer the instrument purchases for a period of time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Looking at -- Brian, can you say -- or John, after MHA, what does the balance sheet look like and what's your capacity after it closes?","Brian D. Jellison","You mean our balance sheet, not MHA's balance sheet?","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, correct.","John Humphrey","So on a post-close basis, I mean, obviously, we'll be borrowing -- a substantial portion of our $1 billion will be borrowed under the revolver. And then that will put us kind of at a debt to EBITDA level of somewhere in the 2.5, 2.6 range, very consistent with our existing ratings and with our long-term commitment to continue to be an investment grade-rated company. So I don't really see an awful lot of pressure there. And then also you see we did raise our operating cash flow guidance for the year up to $800 million. So with the vast majority of that being in the U.S., we'll use that to pay down debt through the year and continue to build capacity with growing EBITDA to continue to do what we've been doing for the past 5, 10 years as well.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. I don't doubt that. I guess, it's more -- what will be left in the revolver and how much cash will you have left?","John Humphrey","So it is a $1.5 billion revolver, and this will -- if all of this is drawn, so it'd be $1 billion. So we still have $500 million available under the revolver plus the cash that we'll generate through the year.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So you're not drawing down your cash balance much at all, it's all in the revolver?","John Humphrey","That's a fair assessment, yes.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then looking at the medical and scientific, it looks like -- did research decline double-digits? Is that kind of what we're looking at here?","John Humphrey","That's correct.","Brian D. Jellison","If you call $12 million on its base, the answer is yes. Down double-digits last year, and they're continuing their trend.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","They were down double-digits last year as well?","Brian D. Jellison","They were. Yes.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So then with the rest of medical outside of Sunquest, was it roughly flat? It sounds like that was certainly below...","Brian D. Jellison","All of medical is the duck on the water, right? So everything looks fine. But the feet are moving fast, so there are different product lines that are doing better than others. Anything that has consumables with it is still doing really well. Some of the product businesses are more mixed. So you've got from negative single-digits to modest growth. We've got some new products that are coming on board, so we feel on balance pretty decent about the medical device side of the business.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And finally, can you give us an idea of the size of the orders in the toll and traffic in Florida and Virginia if you can?","John Humphrey","I don't know if we can do that. Let me check. And if we have approval to give any color on the size of those contract wins, then I'll be able to get back in touch with you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on MHA, a follow-up here. Can you just give us a feel for what the purchased volume that MHA has handled -- what the growth rate been there in the last, say, 3 years? And then also what percentage of MHA's revenue comes from an administrative fee on that?","John Humphrey","So the majority -- in fact, the vast majority of their revenue is an administrative fee on that purchase volume. And that purchase volume has -- there are a couple of different parts to that. You've got the long-term care pharmacy side, where the overall purchase volume has probably been flat over the past couple of years, primarily because of some branded drugs that have gone to generic, kind of that big change, particularly around one drug called SEROQUEL happened last year. So that change over the last couple of years has impacted the pharmacy side. On the long-term care facility side, where most of the purchases are around food, that's been growing at a single-digit -- a mid-single-digit rate on the overall purchase. But MHA has been growing faster than that due to share gains.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Is there a deferred revenue component with MHA? Will there be?","John Humphrey","There will not be a deferred revenue component, no.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question. On the RF tech side of the business, given the growth in the second half will come off of some project work, primarily in tolling, would you expect that the EBIT margin for RF -- or excuse me, yes, for industrial tech -- or excuse me, for RF, will work higher on that project-driven revenue than it is in the first quarter?","John Humphrey","You mean the project-driven revenue at RF?","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. So RF will be driven in the second half by these projects in Virginia. I know you have one in California, also the projects at CBORD. But will the EBIT margin in RF tech work higher in the second half? Is there leverage there? Or is the project revenue going to come in at the same general EBIT level?","Brian D. Jellison","There's 2 kinds of leverage here, right? So one, as we said, one of the reasons that we did better in the first quarter in RF is the quality of the project execution that they have, which is service-related. The second is the margin on product sold. So when you look at a particular situation, like Florida has a lot of tag sales, so the margins associated with the Florida order will be higher than the Virginia order, where the Virginia order has more labor content, which is really almost design and build, if you will. So you're not going to have huge margins there, but you do have spread variances on your execution. And I would say not long ago, we put a new President in at TransCore that's a career expert. Tracy Marks is doing an incredible job. And he's really built a very fine team. We've kind of done some structural things to get more attention on contract execution, and that's starting to pay benefits. So I think we'll see in the second half better leverage on contracts than we enjoyed in the last couple of years. But they still will be the lowest-margin businesses we have just because there's so much labor content in them that they're not high-margin businesses.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. All right. So again, off the first quarter EBIT of, say, 27% for RF tech, we'll still get some volume leverage off of that project work and that should -- our EBIT margin should work higher for the balance of the year?","John Humphrey","Time will tell. We'll be able to talk more clearly about that after we have the third and fourth quarter. But I do want to follow up on one earlier question, Rick, I'm sorry. So just to your question around deferred revenue, the answer is no. There's not really a deferred revenue component for MHA. There will be some noise with respect to how purchase accounting treats some of the revenue that MHA has. That's why our guidance is on a non-GAAP basis. We're going to be adding some of that revenue back that will not be recognized due to purchase accounting rules. And after we close on the business, we'll be able to know exactly how much that is and talk more clearly and have some additional schedules available at the second quarter close that will describe that adjustment in detail.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. First, on the book-to-bill, obviously, very strong in RF. I'm assuming as revenue goes up, maybe book-to-bill qualitatively goes down this year. Can you talk to that? And then the second one, within industrial tech, you talked about double-digit metering gains. Is that competitive? Or do you think that's part of the -- with Elster going away? Or do you think that's part of the market coming back in housing, et cetera?","Brian D. Jellison","From what we've heard from competitors, they didn't do very well first quarter and we did quite well. So people will have to sort out whatever they think the forces at work are. I don't know, I just know that we continue to grow with the exception of the contract cancellation and have double-digit growth in the United States in water meters.","John Humphrey","And then with your respect to your other question, John. So the book-to-bill ratio at 1.15 for the segment, I mean, that is above our norm. We would expect that over time to trend to closer to 1. And it will be based upon the timing of project orders in the RF segment as we go into the second half. Obviously, as some of these orders that we just received ship out in the third and fourth quarter, those will start to bring that ratio back down.","Operator","That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return the call back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.","John Humphrey","Okay. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we do look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter as well.","Operator","[indiscernible]"]}}
