My name is Tanya, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Okay, thanks very much, Tanya, and welcome to Harley-Davidson's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our calls are webcast live on harley-davidson.com and you can access the supporting slides on that site by clicking about Harley-Davidson at the bottom of the homepage, then Investor Relations and Events and Presentations.","This morning Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund will provide their perspective on the quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for your comments. Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","With that, let\u2019s get started, Keith?","Keith Wandell","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call. As always we appreciate your interest in Harley-Davidson. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong gains in our financial performance.","Revenue was up 11.5%, net income was up 30.3%, and operating margin improved by nearly four points to 25.8% as the many improvements in operations over the last few years continue to show up on the bottom line. However, retail motorcycle sales were flat overall compared to a year ago and fell short of our expectations in the U.S. in particular, for reasons that John will go into in a couple of minutes.","Given where we are in the U.S. selling season, we don't believe we'll get back fully on track with our U.S. retail plan for the full year. So in this morning's press release, we announced that we are lowering our full-year 2014 shipment guidance to a range of 270,000 to 275,000 motorcycles compared to prior guidance of 279,000 to 284,000. This new guidance has shipments growing about 3.5% to 5.5% over 2013.","The reason for this adjustment is simple, protecting our premium brand is of at most importance and we will continue to aggressively manage and supply in line with demand in order to do so. We believe the flat retail sales numbers are a temporary situation and that the underlying demand fundamentals of the business remained intact, driven by first, the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, continuing outreach momentum in the U.S., international expansion and at the top of the list, outstanding motorcycles.","The Project Rushmore motorcycles have performed extremely well at retail since their launch last August. And we believe they will continue to be a strong draw as riders migrate to these outstanding bikes. And we couldn't be more pleased with how the Rushmore motorcycles have been received, which we believe is a reflection of the strength of our customer led approach.","Late in the second quarter the Street models began to hit U.S. dealer showrooms. Street is designed for a new generation of riders and U.S. dealers report continued strong interest, enthusiasm in sales of initial shipments.","In India, initial sales of the Street 750 have exceeded our expectations, and the initial response in Italy, Spain and Portugal have also been strong. We look forward to expanding Street to other markets in 2015. Speaking of 2015, the new model launch is just around the corner and it includes the return of Road Glide. While I won't get into the specific features and upgrades we anticipate Road Glide customers and others will be excited by the changes that we've made.","We'll share all the news about the complete 2015 motorcycle line in late August when some 5,000 people from our global network of more than 1,400 dealers gather for our annual dealer meeting.","There's also been tremendous interest and enthusiasm for Project LiveWire, the electric motorcycle we revealed last month. The reveal has generated more than 340 million media impressions to-date. And those who have had the chance to test ride LiveWire have great things to say about it. We are taking Project LiveWire to the streets for customer test rides this year and next. We will gain deeper insight into what customers are looking for from Harley-Davidson in this type of motorcycle, so that if we launch it commercially it will deliver on customer expectations and be authentic to the Harley-Davidson brand.","Project LiveWire builds on other successes at Harley-Davidson. In the last few years we've broadened our reach to a more diverse customer base in the U.S. and globally. And we've accelerated time to market with cutting edge products. LiveWire is just the latest example of how we're pushing the boundaries with awesome products and innovation that builds on our market leadership.","One of the things I'm personally most excited about when it comes to our future is all the new products that are under development.","As always, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our employees, our dealers and suppliers who use their abilities and talents everyday to provide outstanding products and great customer experiences. Together we are focused on continuously improving all the ways we serve customers and ensuring an outstanding future for the company. And now, I'll turn it over to John with more details on the quarter.","John Olin","Thanks, Keith and good morning everyone. I'll review the second quarter financial results starting on Slide 11. During the quarter Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was up 11.5% to $2.0 billion. Our second quarter net income improved to $354.2 million, an increase of $82.4 million or 30.3%. Similarly diluted earnings per share rose to $1.62 per share, up 33.9% from the year ago quarter.","Operating income for the Motorcycle segment was $473.3 million, up 32.3% compared to last year's second quarter. The strong increase in the Motorcycle business was driven by 12.4% increase in revenue behind a 9.0% increase in shipments.","Motorcycle segment operating income also benefited from a higher gross margin percent, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A spending. At Harley-Davidson Financial Services operating income was up slightly year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high-interest debt in February. We are pleased with our second quarter financial results and continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns.","Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 12. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were flat to prior year in both the U.S. and international markets. Second quarter worldwide retail sales tracked below our expectations due to prolonged poor weather conditions across parts of the U.S. and soft U.S Sportster sales in the wake of highly anticipated Street Motorcycles, coupled with Street start-up issues which are impacting the timing of Street availability.","Despite the soft Q2 sales results we believe the quarter demand fundamentals for the business remain intact and underlying growth trends are strong when adjusting for the absence of Road Glide.","As Keith mentioned, as a result of the slow start to 2014, we believe it is prudent to adjust our shipment plan for the full year. We now expect to ship between 270,000 and 275,000 motorcycles worldwide which represents growth of approximately 3.5% to 5.5% versus prior year. Our previous guidance was 279,000 to 284,000 motorcycles.","It is critical for Harley-Davidson to support a healthy retail channel and protect our premium brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand as we had consistently done for the past several years.","During the second half of this year, we expect continued success from Project Rushmore motorcycles, increasing product availability of our very well received Street Motorcycles and a very exciting 2015 model year motorcycle line-up, which will be introduced in late August and include our new Road Glide motorcycles.","On Slide 13, let's review the U.S. market where retail sales were flat to prior year in the second quarter. As I stated, we believe the factors that adversely impacted U.S. retail sales during the quarter were, first, as we anticipated the absence of the popular Road Glide models in the 2014 model year continued to impact year-over-year sales results. Road Glide represented about 10% of U.S.'s retail sales in the second quarter of 2013.","Second, we believe that the prolonged weather conditions across parts of the U.S. likely resulted in lost sales which we believe will not be fully recovered in 2014. Dealers also experienced a sharp decline in Sportster motorcycle sales in the U.S. which we believe was a result of even better than expected enthusiasm we are experiencing for the new Street motorcycles.","Some customers are waiting to compare the two product offerings firsthand, however, we are experiencing a slower than expected dealer retail fill of Street due to start-up issues that have resulted in very low product availability to-date. During the quarter we had a market share of 50.3%. Our market share continued to be at near-record levels. It was down 2.6 points on a year-over-year basis. We believe the decline was driven by the absence of Road Glide in the 2014 model year and our share of the small cruiser segment within the 601+cc motorcycle market decline behind lower Sportster sales, as I just mentioned.","Through the first six months U.S. retail sales were up 1.1% compared to last year and market share declined 1.8 percentage points. While retail sales been short of our expectations we remain focused on the many strengths within our business including strong demand for our Project Rushmore Touring bikes. In fact, year-to-date Touring retail sales were up significantly despite the absence of Road Glide.","And with regards to our new Street motorcycle line-up, the bikes have received a great reception from our worldwide dealer network, the motorcycle press and customers. Early feedback from our Riding Academy suggests graduates are excited about the opportunity to purchase the Street as their first Harley. And early customer sales in India and Southern Europe are very encouraging.","Street motorcycle sales to U.S. dealers for use in our Riding Academy were completed late in the second quarter. A total of approximately 1,600 Street 500s were sold to dealers in the second quarter and approximately 2,200 during the first half. Street motorcycle shipments for customer retail sales began in late Q2 in very limited quantities.","As I noted earlier, we experienced difficulties with the start-up of Street which resulted in a slower Q2 roll-out of bikes to U.S. dealers for sales to customers. We now plan to ship each U.S. dealer two Street motorcycles for retail by the end of August. We anticipate that our ability to supply the U.S. dealer network will improve toward the end of Q3 and into Q4. However, start-up costs will continue. While we have \u2013 while we continue to expect to ship between 7,000 to 10,000 Street motorcycles worldwide in 2014, shipments will be skewed more toward the end of the year versus our original plan.","Overall U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 6,600 motorcycles at the end of Q2 compared to the same quarter last year. Inventory was higher than desired due to our soft retail sales during the quarter. As we have discussed many times we are committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand as demonstrated by our shipment guidance reduction. We continue to expect U.S. year-end retail inventory to be up moderately from 2013 levels driven primarily by the addition of the new Street models.","On Slide 14, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 0.1% in the second quarter. In the EMEA region Q2 retail sales were up 7% driven by growth across most countries, in particular Southern European countries and emerging markets in the region posted very strong growth.","During the first six months of 2014, our 601+cc market share in Europe was 12.1%, down 0.4 percentage points versus the same period last year behind the introduction of several new low price competitive models.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 1.5% in Q2, very strong retail sales in our emerging markets offset a steep decline in Japan. We believe that Japan sales tax increase that went into effect on April 1, 2014, pulled significant sales forward into Q1 resulting in a 33% increase in that quarter and drove a 20.9% decrease in Q2 retail sales.","On a year-to-date basis, Japan retail sales were up 1.0%. Emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region posted very strong gains driven by India, where retail sales were more than doubled during the quarter as a result of a very strong demand for the new Street motorcycles.","Latin America region was down 10.4% during the quarter, as last year's very strong growth of 39.2%. Brazil's retail sales have also been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty, and very aggressive price competition. Retail sales in Canada were down 18% in the second quarter, which we believe is due to poor weather conditions and an adverse response to recent price increases by our Canadian distributor initiated to recover unfavorable currency exchange impacts.","During the quarter, we added five new international dealer points as we continue to increase our international distribution. We believe that we can realize strong international growth opportunities by expanding our dealer network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street.","On Slide 15, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 9.0% compared to last year. Second quarter shipments finished at the low end of our expected shipment range of 92,000 to 97,000 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 6.3 percentage points from the prior year as our new Rushmore Touring motorcycles continue to create demand in the market.","Also during the quarter, shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up, however, not as much as we had anticipated given the challenges with Street start-up. We will continue to ramp up Street motorcycle production through Q3 and expect to be up to speed during the fourth quarter of the year.","On Slide 16, you will see revenue for the motorcycles and the related product segments was up 12.4% in the second quarter, behind a 9% increase in shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit increased nearly $1000 from the year ago quarter primarily driven by higher pricing, favorable mix, and favorable currency. On average, our key currencies in the second quarter were stronger against the U.S dollar by approximately 1% compared to 2013.","Parts and accessory sales were up 0.7% in the second quarter. General merchandize sales were down 6.5% during the quarter. As we move forward with our efforts to transform the Harley-Davidson customer experience, we have initiated an aggressive SKU reduction plan across our parallel [ph] product offering. We believe the reduction will better focus dealers on fast-moving products and improve the customer experience with a more targeted assortment of popular styles. We anticipate a couple quarters of flat revenue as dealers sell through discontinued items.","On Slide 17, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 39.5%, which was up 2.6 percentage points compared to last year. Volume, price, mix, currency, raw materials, and manufacturing were all favorable for the quarter. During the quarter, mix was $30.9 million favorable behind a higher mix of Touring motorcycles compared to 2013.","Looking forward, we expect mix will become significantly unfavorable in the second half of the year as Street shipments increase and Rushmore lapse its Q3 2013 introduction. Foreign currency exchange was $17.2 million favorable during the quarter. This favorability was driven by improved revenues behind a strengthening euro and lapping last year's large Q2 foreign exchange losses.","Manufacturing costs in Q2 reflect the benefits from increased year-over-year production, restructuring savings, and lower pension costs, compared to last year's second quarter. On Slide 18, operating margins as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 25.8%, up 3.9 percentage points compared to last year's second quarter, operating income of $473.3 million for the quarter was favorably impacted by highly gross margin, partially offset by slightly higher SG&A spending and an unfavorable comparison to last year's period, which included $5.3 million in restructuring benefit.","We are pleased with our ability to leverage both our growth margin and operating expenses in the second quarter. Going forward, we will remain intensely focused on improving our cost structure and managing the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","Now moving onto our Financial Services segment on Slide 19, in the second quarter, HDFS operating profit of $74.4 million, was 0.4% higher than last year. The three primary factors impacting second quarter results were first, net interest income was favorable $8.5 million driven by increased receivables and favorable interest expense, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition.","Second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable by $5.0 million due to higher retail credit losses and increase in the reserve rate and growth in retail receivables. And finally, HDFS operating expenses were up $3.4 million.","Going forward, we continue to expect pressure on HDFS' operating income as a result of modestly higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing cost.","Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 20. Larry?","Lawrence Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 10.5%, or $95.3 million compared to the same period last year. The higher originations were driven by a 2.2 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the second quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed.","For the second quarter, HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sold in the U.S. increased to 56% compared to 53.8% in 2013. The primary driver of the year-over-year market share gain was the price changes in the prime segment, which were initiated during the second quarter last year in response to increasing competition.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 9.5% compared to a year ago driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans in both the prime and subprime segments. In the second quarter, between 75% and 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime.","Moving onto credit performance on Slide 21, the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at June 30, 2014, was 2.68%, or 7 basis points lower than 2013. The delinquency percentage at June 30, 2014, is the lowest it has been in 13 years. Annual retail credit losses for the first six months increased by 17 basis points to 0.97% compared to 2013, due to lower recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, some changes in consumer behavior, and lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years.","During the second quarter, HDFS continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, delivered solid credit performance, and contributed strong profitability. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Now, let me turn it back to John.","John Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 22. You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.06 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had approximately $1.3 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the second quarter, HDFS accessory completed an $850 million asset-backed securitization transaction at a weighted average interest rate of 0.93%. In addition, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $135.7 million during the quarter. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is the top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now, I will review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 23. I would like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, we generated operating cash of $570.6 million through the first half of 2014, operating cash flow was up $180.9 million from last year primarily driven by lapping last year's pension contribution of $175 million, lower working capital, and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations. And second, the year-to-date tax rate was 35.3% compared to 34.8% in the year ago period. The higher tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2013.","On Slide 24, you will see our overall expectations for the remainder of the year. As previously stated, we now expect to ship 270,000 to 275,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis in 2014, up approximately 3.5% to 5.5% from 2013 shipments. During the third quarter, we expect to ship 49,000 to 54,000 motorcycles, which is approximately flat to down 9% compared to last year's third quarter shipments of 54,025 motorcycles.","Even with the change in shipment guidance, we continue to believe 2014 operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 17.5% and 18.5%, up from 16.6% in 2013. We believe, 2014 operating margin will benefit from a modest increase in gross margin and from SG&A falling as a percent of revenue.","We expect Q3 gross margin to be approximately 2.5 percentage points below Q3 2013's gross margin driven by one, unfavorable mix, as anticipated Rushmore, which delivered strong mix gains since its introduction will be lapping its initial launch in Q3 2013, while at the same time, we believe Street had a much lower price point will be an increasing portion of shipment mix. Two, lower year-over-year production as we adjust our shipment expectations, and three, start-up costs of approximately $5 million for Street.","For HDFS we continue to expect operating income will be down modestly in 2014 compared to 2013. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be between 215 million and 235 million. Finally, we continue to expect our full-year 2014 effective tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.","So to recap, during the quarter, we successfully increased gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in a 33.9% increase in diluted earnings per share, shipped the first all new Street motorcycles, the customers in the U.S., India, and southern Europe revealed Project LiveWire and electric motorcycle experience, which is generating a great deal of customer excitement and delivered shareholder value through dividends and the repurchase of $136 million of company shares.","While we are disappointed in Q2 retail sales, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results and key accomplishments throughout the quarter. We will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns, and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. Now, let\u2019s take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia. Your line is open from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair","Hi, good morning. There is a lot of conversation in the script about Sportster and the potential weakness there ahead of Street. Is there, I know you don\u2019t normally quantify retail sales by family. But could you give us any kind of granular information on how much that did impact retail sales in the June quarter?","And then secondarily, there seems to be increased investor concern over competition particularly from Indian, but it sounds like Touring sales remained very strong, so perhaps if you could give us some color on that?","Keith Wandell","Sure, Sharon. When we look at the Sportster, the impact, again, kind of taking you back, we announced that Street would be coming to market in November of last year. And at that time we knew it would have some adverse impact on Sportster sales. But we anticipated that to be over the very low months and it ended up extending out being through the entire first half. The reception that we've had to Street was much greater than we anticipated and the impact we believe to our Sportster sales was also greater than we had anticipated. And again, we originally expected to have bikes available for sale very early in the second quarter to consumers.","So when we look at the first half, Sportster sales were down double-digit. And in addition, we didn\u2019t ship and didn\u2019t have any significant retail sales that we had certainly anticipated to have with our Street motorcycle. I think for Street for the quarter for bikes available to customers in the United States, we shipped in about a 150, and we retailed a good percentage of those very quickly, but it was significantly lower than we had anticipated. So we really got hit by both significantly lower Sportster sales and the fact that we didn\u2019t have Street available for sale and we believe there is a very strong demand for that product.","Your second question Sharon with regards to competition from Indian. And Indians, most of the bulk of Indian sales are in the Touring segment. I think two of their three models are in the two that are selling the most are in the Touring segment. And again, our Rushmore bikes have done fantastic, and in the first half they were up in double-digits as well. And when we look at overall market share for the first half, we've got, by far the vast majority of that share, were largely flat, Indian was up a bit and the rest of the competition in touring bikes was down a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, there. Thank you for my \u2013 for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one is on just ASPs in the second half. And could you just help us think about that for a second, because with the \u2013 as your Street shipments increase, I would assume that the ASPs would be down year-over-year, but you mentioned that the Road Glide is coming back and your new product launch is coming soon, so just when you put all of the variables together, how should we think about ASPs for the second half?","And then my second question goes back to the market share question, but just looking forward, as you go over the Street, which is a smaller bike, it seems like your comparable market share numbers are going to be skewed, because that part of your production isn\u2019t going to be captured in that area, so I'm just wondering how we should think about that going forward?","Keith Wandell","Okay. The first question Felicia is ASPs in the second half, we certainly expect them to drop or mitigate, and let\u2019s talk a little bit about that. As we saw in the second quarter, ASPs were up $1000. The largest driver of that was mix and then price and to a much lesser extent currency is first time in numerous quarters that we've seen currency actually benefit our ASPs. But the biggest piece of that is mix.","And the mix favorability that we are seeing in the second quarter, which is on our bridge, they're $31 million. It's certainly more than we had anticipated given the fact that we didn\u2019t ship the Street that we expected. And so basically, we pulled some margin favorability out of Q3 into Q2, and also we pulled some of that ASP from Q3 of the back half into Q2.","So even despite the Road Glide coming back, we would expect ASPs to be down a fair amount in the second half just because of the magnitude of the lower selling price of Street and impact on mix the lower profit there as we increased the percentage of our total shipments of Street in the second half.","Now, having said that, we expect, again, from a financial standpoint, overall gross margins to grow modestly on a year-over-year basis. And when we look at mix in total, we would expect mix to be a benefit on an absolute dollar basis to our profits and as a percent of margin, we expect it to be neutral. At the beginning of the year, we expected it to be a little bit unfavorable and now we are expecting to be more neutral because of the fact that we've had very strong model mix within our Touring segment as people are opting for the higher trim limited as well as the Street Glide special.","The second question that you had was on market share of Street. And I'm not sure I completely understand the question Felicia, but I think dealing with is \u2013 when we talk about 500, of Street 500 that will not be picked up in our market share, because the market share is a 601+cc. However, all of the Street 750s will be picked up in market share, so that we certainly could have retail sales growing faster on a company-wide basis than retail sales for the 601cc segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just couple of questions on Road Glide here, you mentioned that it was 10% of the mix in 2Q of last year. That seems pretty comparable with the number you gave in the first quarter. Obviously, it's difficult to tell how many people are holding off until the upcoming Road Glide is released but it seems like that, that rumor is gotten out there. So, I guess at the end of the day, do you think that it was a bigger headwind in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter when you account for switching?","And as I think about the third quarter, I'm assuming that it represented a very small number of your shipments in the third quarter of last year. Was it a significant part of retail for 3Q, just trying to think about sort of hopefully getting to a tailwind from a Road Glide perspective? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, James. Yes, in the first and second quarter it's been 10%. I think we believe that the impact is consistent between the two quarters. We don't see or we don't believe that as we get closer to it more are holding off, again we've talked about some very loyal customer to that type of riding experience and frame. So, I don't think that there is a kind of a curve here that would suggest that as we get closer more are holding off.","We have done some research and looked at the sales that we've had of Road Glide up to this point and a very, very small percentage of Road Glide had been purchased to-date have been by Road Glide, folks that bought a Road Glide in the last five years. So that gives us increased confidence or renewed confidence that most of our Road Glide riders are loyal and are waiting for the return of Road Glide.","In order to answer your second question, into Q3 of last year, Road Glide accounted for 8% of the total U.S. sales, and remember at that time we're just announcing that Road Glide was being discontinued, we didn't talk about when it was coming back. And we had a tremendous amount of activity on customers buying the Road Glide and snapping them up in the third quarter.","That fell continued into the fourth quarter but fell as a percentage of total U.S. sales down to just sigh of 4% in Q4. And then was move out into the first half of next year \u2013 first half of this year is essentially zero.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. John, I wanted to clarify. Did you say that 150 Street bikes were shipped in the quarter?","John Olin","Essentially, in the U.S., well certainly more were shipped internationally.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","Right, and then of those 150, did any of them count as retail units?","John Olin","Yes.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","Either because they were sold to a dealer, who sold it himself or to a customer?","John Olin","Yes, I'm sorry, the 150 I was referring to were sales just for our customers, not for Rider Academy. And I think somewhere about the third of those retails. So they just started shipping out in the last, very last days of the quarter.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","So, how many went into the Rider Academy and then ultimately were counted as retail because the dealer registered that unit?","John Olin","Okay. So, we're talking just the U.S. market.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","Yes.","John Olin","In the second quarter, 1,600, 500s were shipped into the dealers for use in Rider Academy program. All of those are recorded as a retail sale, because that is their use, despite the dealer. And in the first quarter we had about 600 that went into Rider Academy. So in total, in the first-half about 2,200 bikes went into Rider Academy and then again in the United States we're able to ship out, we're on again very strict allocation of Street going forward of two per dealer, but we shipped out somewhere in the range of 150 for sale to customer, and probably a third of those retail within \u2013 the day they're getting on the floor.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","That's great color. Can you just maybe clarify the production issues you mentioned with respect to Street and how you rectified them, thanks.","John Olin","Yes. So, you know what, to understand some of the Street start-up issues that we're experiencing is really the kind of focus on the fact that this is the first time we're manufacturing product internationally and with that the majority of the supply chain is international which is unlike what we have experienced in the past where the majority of the supply chain is domestic.","And not only is that a much longer supply chain but it is with a lot of new suppliers. And, this is important as we start to deliver Street around the world at a price point that we real good about. Anyhow, with regards to that we're going through a learning curve with our suppliers and our expectations around finishes and quality we've struggled with ordering and delivery and the very long supply chain.","So, in essence, Craig, it's those issues we believe are behind us at this point. However, some of the implications are still in front of us and those implications being the fact that we're on a strict allocation of Street through August and we expect to ship to Street vehicles to each dealer in the United States through the end of August and toward the end of the third quarter we'll be up to speed.","And what basically happened is, there are just not enough parts on their way to us and there's \u2013 because of those issue that we've had. Now to mitigate that and to get as many bikes in our dealers hands and to fulfill the demand that's out there is we are experiencing higher start-up costs namely in the wane of air-freighting parts in. And what we're trying to do is to leapfrog supply chain. So from a production and a manufacturing standpoint, we're not experiencing issues that's much more on the start-up and supply-side of that equation.","That's also having an impact on our profitability between quarters because we expected to ship out a lot more bikes in the second quarter and we would have expected a little bit less gross margin in the second quarter and that's going to come out of the third quarter. And as we've talked about Q3, gross margin is going to be down at 2.5 percentage points, largely borrowed from the second quarter and the extreme mix favorability that we've had.","Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Patrick Nolan \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everyone, and thanks. It's Pat Nolan on for Rod. I have two questions, just following up on the walk. First on the manufacturing one, could you \u2013 John, could you give us a little clarity on what the breakdown of that $25 million is? And it seems like restructuring was maybe kind of $4 million to $5 million and then you have a couple of million that you probably picked up from overhead absorption. But it seems like a pretty large number just for the quarter.","And second on the currency of the $17 million. If you could just give us some clarity of, based on where it currently is today, what you expect that impact to look like in the back-half?","John Olin","Okay. I'm not going to break-out, Pat, the individual pieces of manufacturing but we can certainly talk about the buckets of favorability. And you adequately touched on a couple of them.","The large driver is incremental margin, and in the benefit that we're getting out of that incremental production. And I guess, to take a step back and to look at that number and yes it is a big number. And on a first-half basis the $28 million is big number two. But these are the things that we've been working toward for the last several years and all the restructuring that we've done and the transformation and on the product that we're delivering and the margin structure of the new products that are coming out is really, we're seeing the benefit of lot of that hard-work over the past couple of years.","But the biggest driver is incremental margin and you've got productivity and remember this year we worked on surge manufacturing in Kansas City, so that's delivering it. And our plans are running very well. We've got temporary inefficiencies that are starting to dissipate from where they were at a year-ago level. So on a year-over-year basis there's lower temporary inefficiencies and then we've got pension favorability because of the lower discount rate and that that starts to flow through the pension expense.","And then we've got some offsets going the other way in terms of inflation and Street start-up costs in the quarter, but overall, very pleased with that manufacturing number.","The second question that you asked is with regards to currency. And the currency was favorable, $17.2 million. As I had mentioned in the preamble, driven by favorable euro and lapping a year ago losses. When we do look at the quarter we're still experiencing devaluation of our yen, Australian dollar and British riel [ph] on a year-over-year basis. And we would expect that to continue for the reminder of the year and the euro is making up the difference and euro is about 5% stronger.","So when we look at the back-half of the year, we're looking at currency to be flat to slightly negative and our full-year view of overall currency is a bit more favorable than it was at the start of the year which we felt currency would be on the negative side. Certainly on a full-year basis currency will be positive and we think will largely hold the gains that we've seen in the first-half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, everybody. I saw my first Street 750 on \u2013 near Alicante in Spain a week or so ago. I have to admit, it looked pretty sweet.","Keith Wandell","Excellent.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Guys, a question, at first, I think it's admirable you guys are maintaining tightness in the supply chain to protect pricing. I wonder if you can comment on some of your competitors who maybe aren't either willing or is able technically to be as tight as you to the extent that there is softness in the overall market. Are you seeing or are you otherwise expecting increased pricing in competition in the U.S. market in particular? It's my first question.","And I guess, just more broadly you're citing a lot of companies' specific reasons, and launches, and start-up, and timing as to the second-half outlook, which is essentially flat or even slightly down potentially volume year-on-year shipments for all of the second-half. You're suggesting almost all of the company specific, but I'm just giving you a chance to highlight any broader macro or market reasons for the weakness as well. Thanks.","Keith Wandell","Okay. Adam, we don't see any structural change in pricing in the industry as we move forward. What we're seeing in the first-half is the weaknesses that we expressed which is due to weather and some self-inflicted wounds on Sportster and Street and the interaction between the two. And what our volume guidance is basically doing is taking out that miss in the first-half, and we're back on our growth trajectory for the second-half that we originally anticipated with the year, that's just [ph] slightly a higher growth trajectory.","And so as we've said for quite some time is we're going to deal with the issue and take the volume out. We've got too much inventory and I can't stress enough how much these commitments mean to us. Certainly, shipping guidance is one of them. But the other one is our strategy to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and we are going to maintain the integrity of the market and our dealer network and also the premium nature of the brand.","So, a tough and painful decision, you know we could have talked about promoting our way out or growing our way but we got an issue, we're addressing it and we're pulling it out. But when we talk about the first-half, second-half the brand fundamentals remain intact and nothing is changed in any of those between coming out of the first quarter or last year. We couldn\u2019t feel better about the brand. We are very disappointed in the second quarter results.","But the drivers that we look for in the fourth quarter or the back-half of the year in terms of retail growth as well as into the future are the same drivers that got us here over the last couple of years. And those are strong appeal of the brand and while market share is down 1.8% in the first-half it's certainly within our expectations and all explained, and then some by Road Glide, but also Sportster herd is about third of that margin or I'm sure loss is due to Sportster.","When we look at the industry the industry has grown for three straight years coming into this year and in the first-half the new bike industry is up 2% and that's despite the tough weather as well as the fact that Road Glide represents 5% of the industry in the first-half. We're seeing more investment in the industry than we've seen in the last five years in terms of new products, marketing and advertising. And we're seeing it across all segments.","So feel great there, continued success on outreach. International \u2013 75% of international markets are growing very strong in terms of EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Some difficulties in Canada and Brazil, and otherwise the motorcycles that we've brought to market have been fantastic.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thank you. John, you've given some good explanation of the self-inflicted wounds with the miscalculation on both Street versus the Sportster and start-up issues and so forth. But, regarding retail, can you give us as much as possible, any commentary on what you're seeing so far in July. It appears that weather is starting to get a little bit better, any comments from that standpoint?","And then also regarding the Street margin impact cadence, if we're understanding you right are you saying that, that impact should be largest in the third versus the fourth even though your volume mix of Street will be skewed more to the fourth? And then one final would be, recall cost. Any in the current quarter, mainly in the second that you reported or will those fall more in the third? Thank you.","John Olin","Okay. First question is easy as we're not going to provide any retail guidance on July, though our comments are through the end of the quarter. As we look and as I just mentioned we're back on the growth trajectory. We expect the same growth trajectory as we expected, when we started the year and gave our 7% to 9% guidance. We've taken down kind of our miss in the first-half but expect that.","Now, having said that, we know that the retail comps in the back-half are pretty significant in particular in the third quarter. But again the fundamentals are strong and we're moving forward in the second-half. The second question that you had with regards to which quarter Street will have a bigger impact on, is probably the fourth quarter, but largely in the back-half and again as we get up to speed, full-speed won't be until the fourth quarter.","I don't know if mentioned that we still expect to ship to 7,000 to 10,000 units that we originally did in Street except for they were going to be skewed much more to the back-half. And then the final question was recall costs.","The recall costs are booked when the recall is announced and so all recalls are booked in the second quarter and there is nothing anticipated for the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Hovorka from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph Hovorka \u2013 Raymond James","A question I want to clarify on the Road Glide, I think the first time we started talking about it was the third quarter of last year when you took it out of the line-up and at the time you said it was 10% of Touring volume and 4% to 5% of total volume. And now, we've been talking about 10% retail for the first two quarters for domestic. Is the numbers you originally gave were those worldwide and that's why the overall number is lower or is there something else that (inaudible) like what are those numbers (inaudible)?","Keith Wandell","Joe, you're exactly right. When we first talked about Road Glide, we were doing it versus worldwide numbers Touring is skewed to the U.S. And as we started talking more about the impact on U.S. sales, we kind of moved toward what percentage of Road Glide was of U.S. sales. So all the numbers are correct, the difference is some are worldwide and the ones that we've been most recently talking about in terms of the 10% in the second quarter and the 8% in the third quarter coming up here are of U.S. sales of all motorcycle, all retail or all U.S. retail sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Two questions from me. One is just a clarification on the manufacturing issue. Am I summarizing this correctly? Some of these supplier issues you've kind of corrected or you've gotten them sort of in line to where you want them to be. Now it's really just a matter of premium freight going forward and that's kind of the cost that you see kind of trickling into the second-half. That's my first question and then the second one relates to a country that's near and dear to my heart.","What's going on with Canada? I guess, I wouldn\u2019t have expected down a 10 [ph]. Is there something unusual happening there? So those are two for me.","Keith Wandell","Okay, Pat. Number one, is you're absolutely correct. The issues that we've faced largely in the supply chain delivering and ordering of Street parts is behind us. However, there are costs that would catch-up that supply chain because we do not have enough parts in a very long supply chain, basically on the water coming to us.","And given the very strong demand that we have we're going to try to leapfrog that supply chain to get parts in the U.S. plant. And we've been talking about the U.S., we have kept the flow of parts to India, it's much closer to the source, much easier to get parts there and that has been largely unaffected. It's the U.S. plant that we're talking about obviously affecting U.S. sales.","The second question is with regards to Canada. And to understand what's happening in Canada we have to talk about, Canada is a distributor market for us and most other markets around the world we act as the distributor and the distributor's responsibility is to build the brand and manage the dealer network as well as manage currency and credit risk.","And the distributor we had in Canada has always done a fantastic job. And as you know, Pat over the last year, we've seen a strong weakening of the Canadian dollar, I think on a year-over-year basis about 8%. And to deal with that, our distributor pays us in U.S. dollars, so we do not have a currency risk with Canada per se, and that\u2019s why when we talk about our basket of currencies, Canada never comes up.","However, our distributor there has experienced a essentially an unfavorable currency exchange impact for which he priced the motorcycles to recover a portion of that. The rising prices has created a growing gap to competition as well as to bikes, predominantly used bikes, in the United States. And that has \u2013 had an impact on our volumes, as well as the tough weather conditions, but we've also \u2013 a pricing gap there.","Now, the distributor in Canada working with us here in Milwaukee, is working on mitigating that and is put some store level promotions in place in the month of June and carrying that through into July. And we've seen some event [ph] of the trend there, but it\u2019s clearly \u2013 we're disappointed with overall sales results in Canada.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You guys specifically called out India and Southern Europe as being really strong for Street demand. Can you sort of quantify how many units you expect to go over there and whether or not you are seeing an actual end user that is a much broader sub-segment of the population, and maybe you originally anticipated. And then would you guys comment on how you feel the inventory in the channel is the quality?","John Olin","Okay. With regards to on the overall sales, we're not going to break them out. They come in through the, kind of the Street and Sportster segment. But I can tell you that we are ahead of plan in terms of retail sales in India and Southern Europe. And we are finding it in particular in Southern Europe a lot of people coming off of scooters and small motorcycles and things are going on plan to very well, and it\u2019s been very well received in those markets.","Operator","Our last question for today comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great, thanks for squeezing me in. One, first is one quick clarification, when you are saying currency is now a slight positive for the year, that\u2019s at the profit level right now or at the sales level, or is it both?","John Olin","So, on a year-to-date basis, currency is about flat for the first half. So in the quarter, currency revenue was very favorable with $7.6 million favorable, and then we had cost of goods sold $9.6 million of favorable as we lapped year ago losses. So those numbers the $17.2 for the quarter when we look at revenue for the half, it\u2019s flat.","Amy Giuffre","All right, thank you for your time everyone this morning.

For the first 6 months, EPS grew more than 21% on revenue growth of 6.5%.","We also reported continued improvement in gross and operating margin for Motorcycles and Related Products. This financial performance is a reflection of the outstanding job that our employees are doing throughout the organization. Together with our worldwide network of nearly 1,500 dealers and the support of our suppliers, we are working as one team and moving in one direction to deliver great experiences for our customers around the world.","While the U.S. retail environment in the second quarter in the first half proved challenging, given the persistently cool wet spring in much of the country, we once again gained market share, demonstrating the continued strength and appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand.","In the second quarter and first 6 months of 2013, our team achieved a number of milestones. With the April opening in Stuttgart, Germany of our 100th new international dealership since late 2009, we achieved our goal to open 100 to 150 international dealerships by the end of 2014. In late June, new dealership number 104 opened in Salvador, Brazil. Through international dealership openings, we're better able to save customers in emerging markets, key growth markets and other well established markets.","Also in April, we launched our upgraded and expanded e-commerce site in the U.S. to deliver the premium online experience customers expect. While still in its early months, e-commerce is driving traffic and sales of motor clothes apparel, general merchandise and motorcycle accessories. Of course, e-commerce is just one of many ways we're upgrading the retail experience. We are working closely with our global network of independent dealerships to ensure that customers receive a premium customized retail experience with every visit to Harley-Davidson.","In Motorcycle operations, we completed our first year of seasonal surge production at York with great success. This involved bringing a seasonal workforce to scale up production in the first and second quarters, enabling us to be more responsive to customers and dealers.","Our full-time workforce, together with our seasonal employees, did a great job of implementing seasonal surge and then winding it down, all with outstanding product quality and plant safety.","Looking ahead, we will be expanding our ability to surge production in 2014, including at our Kansas City assembly operations at Powertrain Operations in Milwaukee.","Last month, we continued the yearlong global celebration of the company's 110th anniversary in Rome. The Harley-Davidson leadership team joined 100,000 plus Harley-Davidson enthusiasts for one of the largest rallies we've ever held outside of the United States. It was a remarkable event with more than 35,000 motorcycles in some 35 nations represented and a parade of 3,000 riders through Central Rome. And news of the event went worldwide with more than 2.7 billion media impressions.","Next month, our year-long 110th celebration will culminate in Milwaukee over Labor Day weekend, with more than 60 bands and nonstop activities over 3 days. We're expecting thousands of riders from all over the U.S. and around the world reflecting the reach and strength of our brand. We will also be ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange remotely from the Milwaukee celebration on Friday, August 30. All of us at Harley-Davidson look forward to spending time with customers and celebrating with our extended family.","We also look forward with great anticipation to our worldwide Annual Dealer Meeting late next month in December. We've got an exciting new line of new 2014 motorcycles to unveil, including the first products resulting from our product development transformation. Through this transformation, we expect to increasingly bring more new wow products to market in a shorter amount of time and with a greater level of customer and dealer input than ever.","So in summary, it's been an exciting first half, and there's a lot to look forward to in the back half of the year and beyond. We continue to deliver on our objectives including international growth, operational improvement and financial performance. Through our strategies for manufacturing, product development and the customer retail experience, we expect to continue to extend Harley-Davidson's reach to existing and new customers around the world, to grow our market leadership of core customers, young adults and others in the U.S. and further increase the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand.","Now, I'll turn it over to John for the details on the financials.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith and good morning, everyone. I'll review the second quarter financial results, starting on Slide 10.","During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 3.7% to $1.79 billion. Our second quarter net income improved to $271.7 million, an increase of $24.5 million, or 9.9%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $1.21 per share, up 13.1% from the year ago quarter.","Operating income from the motorcycle segment was $357.7 million, up 15.5% compared to last year's second quarter. The strong increase in the motorcycle business was driven by a 4% increase in revenue behind shipments, which were up 1.3%. Additionally, Motorcycles segment operating income benefited from higher gross margin and lower restructuring spending.","Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was down 9.5%, behind a higher credit loss provision resulting from lapping last year's credit loss reserve releases. We are very pleased with the second quarter financial results.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 11. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.2% during the second quarter, driven by an increase in both the U.S. and international retail sales, which rebounded from declines in the first quarter of 2013.","In the U.S., retail sales bounced back to 4.4% growth after being down 12.7% in the first quarter, as a result of very tough Q1 year-over-year comparisons, driven by extraordinary weather in 2012.","International retail sales increased to 6.7% growth after being down 1.8% in the first quarter of 2013. The largest driver of the improvement was positive retail sales in the EMEA region, which had been down for the past 2 quarters. On a year-to-date basis, worldwide retail sales remain down slightly, with the U.S. being down 2.7%, while international was up 3.3%.","As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we feel great about our brand, our business and our future. We expect a strong second half of the year, behind significantly improved product availability; very exciting model year 2014 motorcycles, which will be introduced in 3.5 weeks; and relatively easy year ago second-half comparisons. We believe we're on track to deliver our full year shipment guidance of 259,000 to 264,000 motorcycles or up approximately 4.5% to 6.5%.","On Slide 12, you'll see that retail sales in the United States were up 4.4% in the second quarter. Our share of the U.S. heavyweight market increased 1.3 percentage points to 53.0% in the second quarter, which represents another record quarter of market share. We do believe retail sales during the quarter were negatively impacted by cooler and wetter-than-normal weather conditions in much of the United States. And consequently, we believe that a portion of the volume that was lost in the second quarter will not be recovered by the end of 2013. This will put pressure on our ability to reach the high end of our full year shipment guidance.","On a year-to-date basis, retail sales in the U.S. were down 2.7%, largely due to the very tough year ago comparison of up 12%, driven by some of the mildest weather across the United States in over a 100 years. Dealer retail inventory in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter was approximately 11,300 units higher than at the end of Q2 2012. We believe this inventory increase is appropriate, considering we cut over to a model year 2014 production in late June and do not intend to begin shipping motorcycles until August 19.","Also, recall that last year, retail sales were negatively impacted as inventory was significantly depleted in the period leading up to the launch of our new motorcycles. This year, we believe the overall inventory level is appropriate to bridge dealers to the launch of model year 2014 motorcycles.","As we have discussed relative to last year, we continue to expect dealer retail inventory to be higher in the first 3 quarters of this year and be lower in the fourth quarter as we expect to implement surge production at our Kansas City facility next year.","On Slide 13, you'll see second quarter retail sales in our international markets were up 6.7%. In our EMEA region, Q2 retail sales were up 1.0% despite continued softness in Southern Europe, especially Spain and Italy. While these markets remain down, they have improved from the previous couple of quarters, as we lap the steep declines, which began in Q3 of 2011. Retail sales in the Northern European countries in aggregate were up in the second quarter after being down the past 2 quarters, driven by strength in the U.K., Switzerland and France. Emerging markets within our EMEA region continue to grow, reflecting our investment in the distribution network.","During the first 6 months of 2013, our heavyweight market share in Europe was 12.5%, up 0.6 percentage points versus the same period last year. Our strengthening market share in Europe is encouraging, especially in light of the economic situation, our competitors' promotional discounting and the introduction of additional models with low price points in that market.","We remain concerned with our European business due to the ongoing recession, which continues to result in low consumer confidence, high unemployment and constrained credit. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand across Europe and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets in the region.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 12.3%, driven by a strong growth in Japan and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In Japan, retail sales were up 9.5% despite a challenging economic environment and intense competitive activity.","Latin America region retail sales were up 39.2% driven by Brazil and Mexico. At the end of this quarter, there were 15 dealerships operating in Brazil versus 11 dealerships a year ago.","Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 3.6% in the second quarter. As we have discussed, we are very focused on investing in our international businesses. We can -- we expect to add 100 to 150 international dealer points through 2014. Over the last 3.5 years, we have opened 104 new international dealer points, with 2\/3 being in emerging markets. We're very excited about the growth prospects in our international businesses.","On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were at the high end of our expected range of 80,000 to 85,000 motorcycles and up 1.3% compared to last year. During the quarter, the mix of custom motorcycles increased over the prior year, while Sportster and Touring declined. As a percent of the total, international shipments were about flat to Q2 2012.","On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycle and Related Product segment was up 4.0% in the second quarter behind increased revenues in all business categories. Motorcycle revenue was up 4.2% behind a 1.3% increase in shipments during the second quarter. For the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $413 from the prior year period, primarily driven by favorable mix and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange.","On average, our key currencies during the second quarter were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 3% compared to last year. During the quarter, parts and accessories sales were up 1.5%, and general merchandise was up 8.7% compared to Q2 2012.","Turning to restructuring on Slide 16. In December 2011, we announced our plan to cease wheel manufacturing in Australia and source those components through existing suppliers. We expected that the transition would cost approximately $30 million, be completed by mid-2013 and result in approximately $9 million in annual savings.","Since that time, we have transitioned a significant amount of wheel production to suppliers. We have also optimized the plant to focus on the production of certain complex, high finished wheels. We are now able to produce these intricate wheels in a cost effective and competitive manner, and as a result, plan to retain limited operations in Australia. To support this direction, a new 4-year labor agreement was ratified by the local union earlier this month. The financial implication of this decision was a reversal of approximately $5 million in previously expensed termination costs. This, along with other restructuring favorability, reduces our expected 2013 restructuring expense from an estimated $13 million to approximately $3 million.","Scaling back, our Australian wheel operations will still result in significant savings. We continue to expect annual savings in 2013 from all restructuring activities of approximately $305 million and approximately $320 million on an annual ongoing basis beginning in 2014.","For the second quarter, we recorded a restructuring benefit of $5.3 million versus an expense of $6.2 million in the quarter of last -- second quarter of last year. We also experienced approximately $5 million in temporary inefficiencies versus approximately $9 million in last year's second quarter.","Since 2009, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. As we exit the restructuring, we will continue to focus on improving retail capabilities and strengthening our world-class distribution channel and product development capabilities. We have established a culture of continuous improvement, and we'll continue to look for ways to operate in the most efficient and profitable manner.","On Slide 17, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 36.9%, which was 1.0 percentage points higher than last year. Volume, price, mix, raw materials and manufacturing were all favorable for the quarter, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Motorcycle pricing was favorable largely due to the model year '13 price increases, which were initiated in August of 2012. Mix was favorable during the quarter due to a higher shipment mix of custom motorcycles and lower mix of Sportsters.","Manufacturing costs were favorable to prior year benefiting from restructuring savings, higher production quarter and lower temporary inefficiencies as compared to last year's second quarter.","Foreign currency exchange continue to be significantly unfavorable during the second quarter as a result of a sizable devaluation of the yen, the real and the Australian dollar on both a year-over-year basis and within the quarter. Foreign currency exchange impact reduced our second quarter gross margin by $13.4 million or approximately $0.04 of EPS and reduced our gross margin percentage in the quarter by approximately 0.5 percentage point. As we look forward, we continue to expect foreign currency to adversely impact gross profit in the third quarter.","On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 21.9%, up 2.2 percentage points compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring expense with the reversal of a portion of previously expected termination expenses related to our Australian wheel operation.","As a percent of revenue, SG&A in the second quarter was 15.3% versus 15.8% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect SG&A spending will increase on a year-over-year basis in 2013 and 2014 as we continue to invest in growth initiatives, but decrease as a percent of revenue through 2014.","Now moving onto our Financial Services segment on Slide 19. In the second quarter, Harley-Davidson operating profit decreased $7.8 million or 9.5% compared to last year. The 3 key drivers of second quarter results were: First, net interest income was up $3.2 million resulting from lower interest expense, primarily driven by lower cost of funds; second, the combined change in the provision for retail and wholesale credit losses was unfavorable by $16.1 million on lower credit loss reserve releases and higher retail credit losses on a year-over-year -- on year-over-year recoveries. As we noted last quarter, we lapped $11.2 million of credit loss rate reserve releases from Q2 2012.","Finally, operating expenses were lower by $3.3 million. We're pleased with the performance of our Financial Services business in the second quarter. On a full year basis, we continue to believe HDFS's 2013 operating income will be modestly lower than 2012 as the business benefited from approximately $17 million of 2012 credit loss rate reserve releases, which may not repeat in 2013. Also we expect increased competition will continue to put pressure on HDFS's operating income this year.","Additionally, we expect modestly higher retail credit losses in 2013 due to lower recoveries resulting from fewer charge-offs in prior periods, changing consumer behavior and HDFS's funding of additional loans, which we believe are prudently structured in the near prime and subprime segments.","Finally, key benchmark interest rates increased sharply during the second quarter. We believe HDFS is well positioned to navigate a changing interest rate environment given its diversified funding portfolio, which should delay the full impact of interest rate increases over several years. Therefore, we expect minimal impact on HDFS's earnings in 2013, but we believe rising interest rates will result in some compression of HDFS's lending margins over time.","Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations on Slide 20. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John and good morning. During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 9.9%, or $82.1 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year new retail motorcycle sales and a 2.3 percentage point increase in retail financing market share.","For the second quarter, HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 53.8%, compared to 51.5% in the second quarter of 2012. We are pleased to see this increase, despite increased competition in the prime segment. In response to competitive pressure, we initiated certain prime segment rate reductions in both the first and second quarters, and these contributed to our second quarter market share gains.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 3.4% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in the wholesale portfolio. We believe the overall loan portfolio is solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. In the second quarter of 2013, between 75% and 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime.","Moving on to credit performance on Slide 21. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at June 30, 2013 was 2.75% or 7 basis points higher than 2012. This is consistent with consumer's willingness to take on more debt, as well as our actions over the past several years to modestly increase approval rates in the near prime and subprime categories. As we fund additional loans, we believe are prudently structured. To put this delinquency percentage in the proper perspective, this is only the second time in at least the last 12 years where HDFS has finished the second quarter with retail delinquency below 3%.","Annual retail credit losses increased by 22 basis points to 0.8% in the second quarter compared to 2012, primarily driven by lower levels of recovery. This was expected given that the lower level of credit losses in the past few years has left a smaller pool of potential recovery dollars.","We are pleased with the progress at HDFS, as we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, deliver solid credit performance and contribute strong profitability. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Now, I'll turn it back to John.","John A. Olin","Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 22. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.43 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.42 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the second quarter, there were a couple of transactions related to cash. First, we completed a $650 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 0.71%. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $81 million during the quarter.","As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now, I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 23. I'd like to highlight 2 items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $390 million during the first 6 months of 2013. Operating cash flow was up $101 million from last year, primarily driven by increased earnings. And second, the tax rate through 6 months was 34.8%. This reflects the benefit of the R&D credit, which was reinstated retroactively with the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 at the beginning of 2013. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34.8%.","On Slide 24, you'll see that for 2013, we continue to expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 259,000 and 264,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4.5% to 6.5% from 2012. We believe the underlying demand fundamentals in the U.S. are strong. However, as I said earlier, the impact of the poor weather in the second quarter will put pressure on our ability to reach the high end of our full year shipment guidance.","During the third quarter, we expect to ship between 51,000 and 56,000 motorcycles, which is in line with last year's second quarter shipments of 52,793 units. We continue to expect full year 2013 gross margin will be between 35.25% and 36.25%. As we look forward to the second half of this year, we expect gross margins to come down from the first half levels behind lower production and unfavorable currency exchange. Capital expenditures in 2013 are expected to be between $200 million and $220 million.","Looking back, we're pleased with our second quarter results and key accomplishments. During the quarter, we successfully completed first year surge manufacturing at York, in doing so maintained the highest level of quality and safety as we surged our workforce. Celebrated our 110th anniversary in Rome, with over 100,000 Harley-Davidson enthusiasts from 35 nations, delivered shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases and fulfill dreams of personal freedom for new and existing customers around the world.","We continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Gentlemen, a couple of things here. Could you make any comments on the retail cadence and the potential effect that retail of discontinuing the Road Glide? Secondly, Larry, you talked about getting a little more aggressive I think, in the subprime, and how you've taken steps to mitigate that. Can you contrast your approach to subprime this cycle versus last cycle?","John A. Olin","Hi, this is John. I'll start out with the first question, Tim. each year, we bring models in and out of our lineup as we introduce new models. And this is quite a common practice for us. And we did announce to the dealer network that we would be exiting the Road Glide for the year as we retooled it and refreshed that model. While the Road Glide is a strong model or those 2 Road Glide models are strong for us, they represent a relatively small portion of our overall Touring sales. And we don't expect any large impact from that taking those units out for the next model year.","Lawrence G. Hund","Tim, this is Larry. On the, on your question about subprime and how do we handle it different this cycle versus last cycle. We have invested a lot over the last several years in our data warehouse and our analytical capabilities. And we are much more data driven in the way we approach subprime lending versus, I would say, we're probably more intuitive in the last cycle. So I think that we have provided a lot of training, good tools to our underwriters to use in making credit decisions, and it's driving much more consistent credit decisions versus what we did the last time. It also allows us to test certain things, see how changes perform. And if they don't perform well, then we quickly back out of those. So I think this investment in the analytic capabilities will pay off or us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was going to ask whether you asked the Pope to pray for better weather, but since I only get one question, I'll focus on the opportunity to raise price. The way I see it, you've got a dynamic environment where you've done the right thing to get scarcity back into the brand, reduce inventory, you've got new products coming. But you've also got more competition in this space. Do you still see an opportunity, I guess, to raise wholesale prices given all the work you've done?","Keith E. Wandell","With regards to overall pricing power, we've talked about for quite some time. We have worked hard at making sure that we've got our supply and demand in balance. And the brand has been very strong. For the last 4 years, we've gained share. Matter of fact, out of 15 of the last 19 quarters, we've gained share. And so we will, as always, evaluate the opportunity to raise prices. And we'll announce those with our new model year coming up here in about 3.5 weeks. But in general, we do believe that we possess pricing power as we move into the future.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Guys, a couple of questions. First, can you comment on used bike prices? And also, a couple, two part on the yen. Any impact on the competitive side from the weakening end that you could witness at all, and more tactically, on your results? Could we expect that the FX impact on gross margin could be worse in the second half than in the first half, in particular for the yen as your hedges roll?","John A. Olin","Adam, with regards to used bike prices, we've been in a period of stability since the fourth quarter of 2011. And we do not see again -- both the new and used bike prices have been growing at the same rate or declining at the same rate in the case of the first quarter or the first half of this year. But overall, used bike pricing has been very stable for the last 4 to 5 quarters. The second question is with regards to yen. We have not seen anything directly with regards to competitive price pressures from our Japanese competitors. And again, remind you that when the yen was strengthening, and we didn't see a whole lot of price movement by our Japanese competitors during those years. And we believe at that time, they took out a fair amount of profit. Don't know what's going to happen in this round, but at this point, we are not seeing higher levels of discounting. And perhaps, they're certainly more profitable, but we'll have to continue to wait and watch that, but no signs yet. And in terms of the financial results, clearly, the devaluation of the yen as well as in this quarter, The Australian dollar and the Brazilian real had a significant financial impact. When we look at the second quarter, overall revenue was down $13.7 million, and the yen, in particular, devalued 19% from the year ago second quarter. It did cause a financial hit of $13.4 million. And what I can tell you is #1 is we didn't expect that big of -- unfavorability in the quarter, and there was a significant amount of devaluation that occurred within the quarter. But as we look forward, we do expect currency to be unfavorable. We do not expect it to be at the same magnitude that we've seen in the first half. But again, things are certainly always very dynamic and changing in the world of currency. We do expect it to be unfavorable, but not to the same extent as the first half.","Operator","Your next question is from James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Talk a little bit about the set up as we head into the model year crossover here in a few weeks. I guess first question, I mean you guys have certainly been pretty optimistic in terms of the products that you're going to be bringing to the table. And I think the dealers have certainly picked up on that. You think there's any chance that some of your customers, in anticipation of that excitement, may have delayed some of their purchases during the second quarter? And I guess, secondly, from a competitive standpoint, with the reintroduction of Indian and some other competitive products out there and on the way, how susceptible do you think your customer base is to maybe switching to any American-made competitors?","Keith E. Wandell","This is Keith. I'll just jump in here for a second. We also have -- this is Keith, I'm sorry; I'll jump in here for a second. We also have Matt Levatich here with us too, and he may have a couple of comments about that. But clearly, we're going to launch our new lineup next month. And I think we don't really talk a lot about the products that are in the pipelines. So my guess is that while there might be some speculation on the part of our dealers and our customers, I think it's mostly that I think we've got our inventories pretty well online. And we think we're in pretty good shape in terms of going into this 2014 lineup. I know our dealers will be working hard to get -- to move all of the 2013 products. And again, I don't think there's a massive amount of those in the system. So I think we should be in pretty good shape on that. As far as any of those, you will see. I mean it's a brand that's been in and out of the market a few times over the last 50, 60 years, whatever. And I think the issue is going to be, for them, getting the new products launched, getting them in the marketplace, what kind of a dealer network gets set up and all those kind of things. I mean we take all of our competition very seriously. We're not taking anything lightly, but we believe that the way we've positioned our company and how we've transformed product development and the pipeline of products that we have coming, not just in '14 but '14, '15, '16 and beyond, our job here is to just continue to bring great products to market and make sure that we're winning with great products.","Operator","Your next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just regarding the second half of 2013, you mentioned a few drivers were new product availability, the new products and easier comparisons. I'm wondering which is the maybe the biggest factor. And then also, just from a comparison perspective, maybe just helping us think about the weather in the second quarter to come up with a more normalized trend line. And I know John, sometimes you look at the sunshine states versus the non-sunshine. Is there a way to breakout kind of the, maybe the regions that were not affected by weather, which I know had an impact in a lot of the leisure vehicle companies?","John A. Olin","Okay, Greg, I'm not going to quantify the 3, but as we look forward to the second half, we do think there's 3 very strong things in our favor. And let me go through them each real briefly as they improve product availability. If you recall, last year, and it's particular in the third quarter, we ran dry of product. Pump ran dry. And retail sales were adversely affected in the United States by 5.2%. And as we come into this year's second half, we've got 11,300 more units. And we've got a bridge of period from late June to August 19. And now we've got a lot more products to do it than what we did last year, and not having enough product last year was an issue. And that was -- that's the piece leading up until the trial lunch. And again last year in terms of product availability, when we did launch our product in the third week of August last year, we did not have tremendous amount of firepower. If you recall, we were putting in ERP system in our York facility, and we lost 40% of our July production. So it took us 8 weeks to get back to year ago levels, and we would expect a much quicker replenishment this year. So overall, product availability will be very strong in the second half, and in particular, in the third quarter. The second is the model year product. And as Keith had mentioned in the preamble, we're very excited about it. It is the first product that we've developed since the transformation under a new product development methodology. And we're excited for that. And everyone has got to wait the 3.5 weeks to see what it is. And then finally, when we talk about the year-over-year comps, is the first quarter of last year of 2012 was up 9.3%, and the second half was up about 2%. So just generally, if you look at that much easier as we look to the second half. So all 3 of them, we're very excited about, and we believe will drive a strong second half for us. The second piece that you mentioned is weather. And you asked about second-half weather, but let's talk a little bit about the second quarter. We did have challenging weather as everyone knows, and most of that weather was unfavorable in the eastern 2\/3 of the United States. It was cold and damp, and it was for a very prolonged period of time. When we do look at the pieces that were not affected by weather, which is really the western 1\/3 of the United States, we saw actually in the second quarter, double-digit growth. And we have seen some strong growth in the first quarter, which was pretty unaffected by weather as well, but that accelerated in the second quarter, and we saw double digits. Now when we look at the western states dealers that represents slightly less than 20% of our overall volume. The other 80% of the U.S. was in the low single digits and again, clearly affected by weather. When we look forward, we have no idea what weather will be, but last year's weather from August through December was much more in the normal range. So we don't anticipate any issues with weather as we move forward, but you never can tell.","Operator","Your next question is from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a question regarding the move to surge at Kansas City. And then in Milwaukee, what kind of, sort of disruptions from an operating perspective can we expect, or should we see sort of stepped up temporary inefficiencies surrounding those changes as we get in the second half? And then related to that, maybe you can give us a sense of how the mix will be impacted? I guess since they make the lower mix bikes, might you actually see a positive offset from kind of York products becoming a bigger part of the pie? So really those would be my 2 questions.","Keith E. Wandell","When we look at moving to surge in Kansas City in 2014, we do not expect any disruption with regards to overall production. Remember that Kansas City has been producing similar to the way that we transformed our York facility. They only focus on fabrication of frames, tanks, fenders, assembly and paint, so that's all been set. So there's not a lot that's going need to go on within it. It is more of the same thing that we had to do in York after we transformed the plant, is to bring in temporary workers, get them trained on the line and producing more or further utilizing our factories in the first half. So we feel great about that as we move forward. We had a great experience in York, and we don't foresee any issues in KC. So we expect no impact on operations or productions or the mix of our product. You did mention temporary inefficiencies, and we do expect as we get that operation started up that we will have some temporary inefficiencies with the training of those workers and the hiring and those types of things. So I think this year we've got -- we expected half of temporary inefficiencies to go away from I think, 36 last year to about 17 this year. And we would expect a fair amount of inefficiencies to fall off next year, but they won't go completely away because of such things such as the startup of surge operations in Kansas City.","Operator","Your next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Keith, you reiterated your production guidance, but then you said you wouldn't make the high end. So I'm just confused as to why you keep the high end out there? And I'm wondering, by taking the high end off the table, if there's any gross margin implication from that? And then also, while you've been very clear that weather played an impact on sales in the quarter, I'm just wondering if there's -- and also obviously, the international business is tough. But I'm wondering if you're seeing any impacts on your business domestically at all from the economy? Has anything changed since you last adjust us the last quarter?","John A. Olin","Felicia, I'll take the question with regards to the guidance. Our guidance is 259,000 to 264,000 units. And what we said is the second quarter and the prolonged weather is we lost some sales. We think we'll get some of them back over the remainder of the year, but not all of them. And when weather affects us and it's a month or 2, a customer comes in and markedly has to buy the bike in April because of weather. That's not a big deal. And what we're seeing here is that somebody that may have come in, in March and now it's July, and over half the riding season is done; we may see that person wait until the next riding season. So we do believe that there is an impact on our full year shipments this year due to weather in the second quarter. We did not say that we would not make the high end of guidance. We're just acknowledging the fact that we don't believe all of the volume that was delayed or the purchases that were delayed in the second quarter are going to be sold this year. And therefore, that will put pressure on the upward end of hitting our guidance. And so our guidance is 259,000 to 264,000 units. With regards to gross margin, our guidance there is 35.25% to 36.25%, there's no change. The only impact of selling less in the second quarter would be as we aggressively manage supply and lines met demand if we come down in the range. That would slightly affect some of the incremental margin and gross margin. But again, feel very comfortable with our 35.25% to 36.25% guidance that's out there.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Keith, follow-up to the, on the -- does anyone want to address my economy -- my question about the domestic economy, is this affecting your sales at all?","Keith E. Wandell","Well, I think we've been -- this is Keith, I'm sorry. I think we've been very consistent for the last several quarters in saying that we've been very cautiously optimistic about the economy. If you see things like in June, home sales are higher than they've been for some time, and that's certainly encouraging. I still question whether home equity values are -- have risen to the point where they were before, which we think is something that certainly affects us in the United States, unemployment, underemployment is still rather high. So we think that there's still somewhat of a drag in the economy. And when you look at Europe, you know that I think yesterday, there was some news out of Europe that consumer sentiment had improved somewhat, but was still lower than what it had been over the last couple of years. We know that certainly, the Southern European countries, like Italy and Spain and Portugal and others, continue to struggle quite a bit. So I mean we think it's a kind of a mixed bag. And for us, it's really about -- I mean, when you go and you look at what happened in Rome, and you look at 100,000 enthusiasts being there and 35,000 bikes and the people from 35 different nations, I mean we know that the affinity and the affection for this brand is as high and higher than it's ever been. So our job is to, in spite of the economic drags that we see, our job is to continue to provide great customer experiences and make sure that we're bringing new customers into the family and satisfying their dreams of personal freedom, and we think we're doing that. So we think that's how we're sort of offsetting all those other issues.","Operator","Your next question is from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was wondering why we didn't see better growth in parts and accessories? Why that trailed both motorcycle shipments and retail sales?","John A. Olin","Gerrick, this is John. Parts and accessories, a fair portion of that revenue is driven by repairs and service parts. And what we saw in the second quarter is that report -- repair orders to our dealers were down about 10%. And so basically, with the bad weather, not only does it affect retail sales of motorcycles, but it affects the miles ridden. And as customers are out riding motorcycles, they need new tires and oil, and they need to do their checkups and whatnot. We've seen that being down on a year-over-year basis. So again, the weather impacted the miles ridden this year. And the converse of that is last year's weather was so extraordinarily good, customers were out riding more and needing those things on a year-over-year basis. So in the quarter, we were up about 1.5% which was a little bit lighter than our retail sales at 4.5%. But it was driven by that side of the parts and accessories business.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, so you're not seeing any decline in the amount of customization that guys are doing to their bikes or the amount of accessories they're buying when they buy their new unit?","John A. Olin","No.","Operator","Your last question is from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You guys had mentioned some competitive promotions in Europe. And I'm curious how you guys feel you're holding up with pricing there? And then what do you actually see that international percentage of sales getting to? Can it get to 40% or 50% annually, or do you kind of have a, do you have a long-term goal for that?","John A. Olin","Hi Jaime, this is John. Given the overall environment in Europe, we are seeing a lot of price competition. Harley-Davidson stays away from it, sometimes our dealers do, but we try not to price promote in any way. And it just makes that price disparity between our positioning, which is a super price point position versus some of our competitors a little bit greater. As we look at our European business and understand how tough it is in Europe, this is clearly a tremendous bright spot for us. So we're through 6 months of this year, our share is up 6\/10 of a percentage point, again, given that super premium price point. So it goes to what Keith was saying, the brand is highly desired around the world, and in particular, in Europe as well. And they're willing to pay the price to have a Harley-Davidson and ride the best. But it does affect the consumer decision at times. We keep a close eye on it, and chooses, in most cases, not to participate in any way, shape or form. Jaime, with regards to the overall market share and where we can get, I can't provide a forward look at that. What I can tell you is that 10 of last 11 years we've gained share, the only sure time we did not gain share was last year. And I think we lost a 1\/10 of a point, and that was with the onset of a lot of the issues in Europe. And so again, that's why it feel so good to bounce back a bit here and be up 6\/10 of a point. We feel very strong about the business, we feel very strong about the distribution network that we've built and the overall desire for the brand. But I know we're going to continue to do what we do best and build the brand and the distribution network.","Amy Giuffre","And John, I think a good example of that is what just happened in Rome.","John A. Olin","Yes, absolutely. Maybe the Pope was blessing us.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you for your time this morning, everyone.

Click Company at the top of the homepage, then Investor Relations, and Events and Presentations.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, our President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin will be hosting the call. Matt, let's get started.","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. We set out in 2016 to raise our game and drive demand by leveraging the capabilities we've built since the downturn to solidify our leadership position and attract new riders around the world to our sport.","Capabilities that we've built like our improved time-to-market and enhanced stability to create high-impact new motorcycles; our flexible, responsive manufacturing system designed to meet demand in dynamic global markets; our expanded reach with new dealers in emerging markets and our ability to inspire our outreach customers; young adults age 18 to 34, women, African-Americans and Hispanics to join our sport and brand in the U.S.","While overall U.S. industry performance was soft, I'm pleased with how we raised our game to drive demand and adapt throughout the year. Importantly, we drove market share strength in the U.S. and picked up one full share point on the year with two points of share gain in Q4. In August, the Milwaukee-Eight engine debuted on all of our new Touring bikes along with a redesigned upgraded suspension.","We delivered what matters to riders, more torque and horsepower for a way better ride on our class-leading grand American Touring bikes. We had our best ever retail sales in Asia-Pacific and in EMEA and maintained our number one position in key markets like Japan, Australia and Canada. We increased our reach by adding 40 new dealer points in places like the Philippines, Belgium, Italy, Vietnam, Norway, New Zealand and Croatia to name a few.","We grew ridership in the U.S. by training more than 65,000 new riders through our Riding Academy and we invested in our manufacturing capabilities by retooling our Pilgrim Road Powertrain Operations and by implementing our ERP solution in our Kansas City plant, building our strengths to compete even more effectively in the years ahead.","While we made great progress, our demand-driving efforts only partially offset the impact of the down U.S. market, the U.S. is uniquely important to our business, so our long-term plans reflect the challenges in the market as we must adjust to accommodate what we believe is the new normal for U.S. market performance.","John will go through the final numbers for 2016 and review our guidance for 2017; then I'll come back and provide the long-term view and direction for the company in 2017 and beyond. John?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Today I'll provide additional insight around our fourth quarter and full-year financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of fourth quarter financial results starts on slide six.","During the quarter, revenue was $1.11 billion, net income was $47.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.27. Operating income from the Motorcycles segment was up $2.9 million or up 45.6% from last year. Segment revenue was down 7.4% in the quarter behind an 11.9% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year quarter, as a result of unfavorable currency exchange. SG&A was significantly lower during the quarter. Consequently, operating margin as a percent of revenue improved by 0.4 percentage points.","At HDFS, operating income in the fourth quarter was down 1.2% year-over-year. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. Our results in a very challenging year underscore both our commitment and capability to perform in a much more competitive and dynamic marketplace.","Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are summarized on slide seven. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q4 were down 0.5% versus prior year. Retail sales were down modestly in our international markets during the quarter, partially offset by slight growth in the U.S. The global competitive environment remains intense, but we believe our increased investments in driving demand and product innovation are working. The positive response to our Milwaukee-Eight engine, for example, drove significantly improved Touring sales and overall Harley-Davidson market share gains.","We continue to be encouraged with our ability to stabilize and grow market share across many markets, doing so in ways that leverage our premium brand and protect profitability for the company and our dealers. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were down 1.6% compared to last year. 2016 retail sales reflected significant global competitiveness and very soft U.S. industry demand. 2016 saw increased investment in driving demand and new product development, and consequently, we delivered strong market share in many markets in the face of intense competition.","Let's take a closer look at the U.S. on slide eight. In the U.S., we were very pleased to see quarterly growth return for the first time since world currencies shifted dramatically in late 2014. However, retail sales were below our expectations due to continued weak industry conditions and limited availability of model year 2017 motorcycles.","We remain committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand, including the right mix of product in the marketplace. In Q4, we shipped fewer motorcycles than we planned to support our commitment to hold year-end U.S. retail inventory flat to prior year. Limiting model year 2017 motorcycle shipments allowed U.S. dealers to focus on selling model year 2016 inventory and help reverse the significant increase in year-over-year retail inventory at the end of the third quarter.","Our actions resulted in largely flat Q4 retail inventory compared to prior year. However, we believe that limiting the availability of 2017 motorcycles also adversely impacted Q4 retail sales. We believe U.S. dealers had too many 2016 motorcycles in retail inventory at the end of the fourth quarter, and we will continue to support their efforts to sell through these motorcycles.","Our Q4 market share of the 601+cc market was up 2.0 percentage points, even though model year 2017 motorcycles were constrained during the quarter. For the full year, our market share was up 1.0 percentage points to 51.2%.","We believe our market share growth was driven by our demand-driving investments focused on growing product awareness and ridership in the U.S., sales to outreach customers, which outpaced sales to core customers for the fifth year in a row, and the fantastic response to our 2016 S Model Cruisers, and our new 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine.","In the fourth quarter, U.S. industry was down 3.2%, which was softer than expected, despite what we believe was increased year-over-year discounting by our competitors and given last year's industry decrease of 3.8%.","We believe the industry continues to be adversely affected by weakness in oil-dependent areas and soft used-bike values, compounded by economic uncertainty. We are very pleased that we were able to grow our market share in the U.S with our brand-enhancing actions and product innovation, despite high levels of discounting by the competition.","On slide nine, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 1.3% in Q4. Overall, international retail sales were quite strong with the exception of three markets; Brazil, India and Indonesia. Excluding these three markets, international retail sales would have been up 3.5% in the quarter. For the full year, international sales were up 2.3%.","During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 2.6%, fueled by strong market reception to the S models and the Milwaukee-Eight powered bikes. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were up 5.9% and full year market share in Europe was 10.8%.","In Asia-Pacific, Q3 retail sales were down 0.4% from last year and up 2.0% for the full year. Sales in the quarter were adversely affected by significantly lower sales in India and Indonesia. In India, sales were down over 20%, driven by currency demonetization. In Indonesia, retail sales remained down significantly behind the reset of our dealer network in that market. Three dealerships were opened in Indonesia late in the quarter and we expect to be back to previous levels by the end of 2017.","Retail sales in Latin America were down 14.4% in Q4 and 13.2% for the full year. Sales were down in the region largely due to continued declines in Brazil resulting from a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty, and very aggressive price competition. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 0.2% in the quarter and up 5.5% for the full year.","On slide 10, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments were down 11.9% in the quarter and down 1.6% for the full year. Shipments for the quarter were below our shipment guidance range, in line with our commitment to manage supply in line with demand and protect our brand. Fourth quarter shipment mix skewed toward Touring, reflecting the high demand for the new 2017 Touring motorcycles.","On slide 11, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was down in the fourth quarter, behind lower year-over-year motorcycle shipments. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $546 for the quarter behind higher pricing, a richer product mix, and slightly favorable currency exchange.","For the full year, motorcycle segment revenue was down 0.7%, behind a 1.6% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Parts and accessories and general merchandise revenues were down for the quarter and the full year, due in part to lower motorcycle shipments and lower retail sales.","Our gross margin review is on slide 12. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was down during the quarter driven by unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by increased pricing, lower manufacturing expense and favorable mix. During the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 7% versus our key foreign currencies, resulting in a significant balance sheet re-measurement. Consequently, gross margin was adversely impacted by $14.5 million of currency exchange or 1.7 percentage points.","Mix was favorable during the quarter as we shipped a higher mix of Touring motorcycles compared to last year behind strong consumer demand.","Gross margin was favorably impacted by $9.6 million due to lower manufacturing expense and lower cost in our P&A business. We are pleased that our plans are operated efficiently after the significant inefficiencies that we experienced during the first three quarters of 2016, when we retooled our Pilgrim Road plant, launched the Milwaukee-Eight engine, and as we implemented our ERP system in Kansas City. For the full year, gross margin as a percent of revenue was down 1.7 percentage points from 2015 behind higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable currency exchange and unfavorable product mix.","On slide 13, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q4 was 1.0%, up compared to last year. Operating margin was favorably impacted by lower SG&A, largely offset by a lower gross margin. Last quarter, we announced a reorganization that would streamline our operations to be even more focused, aligned and agile. Reorganization charges for the quarter totaled $18.2 million for the Motorcycles segment.","Fourth quarter SG&A was considerably lower than prior year, as we experienced lower employee costs given fewer employees, lower marketing expenses, and as we benefited from lower year-over-year reorganization costs and other non-recurring items.","For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 14.7%, down from 2015 behind lower gross margin. Operating margin was slightly below our expectations, largely driven by the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter, resulting in unexpected re-measurement losses. Profitability remains a key focus and we believe that we can further leverage our established capabilities to drive profit in the future.","Moving on to HDFS on slide 14. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $0.7 million or 1.2% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting Q4 results were, first, net interest income was up over prior year by $1.8 million. This increase was driven by higher yields, partially offset by higher borrowing costs.","Second, provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $8.5 million, driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance. And finally, HDFS benefited from lower operating expense during the quarter. On a full-year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $275.5 million, a decrease of 1.7% compared to 2015. HDFS' operational results are on slide 15.","For the quarter, originations were up 2.8% compared to last year. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales at nearly 62%. At the end of the year, we had $334.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS.","In addition, HDFS had $1.24 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.","On slide 16 you'll see 30-day delinquency rates. Retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet at yearend was 4.25% or 47 basis points higher than Q4 2015; 13 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of portfolio after the Q2 2016 full securitization of prime receivables. Consistent with vehicle financing industry trends, the increase, on a managed basis, was due to higher delinquencies across the portfolio including oil-dependent areas.","The annual retail credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.83% or 41 basis points higher than 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.80%. The increase was due to higher defaults across the portfolio, including those in oil-dependent areas (16:43) and lower used-bike values at auction.","During 2016, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company, as demonstrated by the $106 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson this month.","The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on slide 17. A few things to note; operating cash flow was up from last year driven by lower wholesale financing and lower working capital, partially offset by lower net income; and the full-year tax rate was 32.4%, which was lower than 2015's tax rate, primarily behind the successful closure of various tax audits. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. Our full-year results are summarized on slide 18.","Turning to slide 19, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We are committed to driving Motor Company ROIC, which falls within the top quartile of the S&P 500 through the disciplined investments that we make. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases.","For the full year, we repurchased 9.7 million shares for $459.1 million, and increased our dividend by 12.9%, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 36.6%. We will continue to look for opportunities to maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand.","On slide 20, you'll see our overall expectations for 2017. In 2017, we expect shipments to be flat to down modestly, behind lower shipments in the U.S., offset by international growth. We expect year-end retail inventory to be flat in the U.S. and up in our international markets behind a growing dealer network. We expect first quarter shipments to be approximately 66,000 motorcycles to 71,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 15% to 20% compared to last year, driven by our commitment to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and continue to focus our dealers' efforts on sell-through of the excess model year 2016 motorcycles in the U.S.","We expect retail inventory in the U.S. at the end of the first quarter 2017 to be considerably lower than Q1 2016. We also expect retail inventory at the end of Q1 to be comprised of an improved balance of 2016 and 2017 model year motorcycles to start the spring selling season.","During 2017, we expect continuing headwinds on retail sales, including a soft U.S. industry driven by weak oil-dependent regions and soft used-bike prices, intense and potentially increasing competitive discounting in the U.S., continuing new product competition, and global economic and political uncertainty and volatility.","However, we expect 2017 retail sales to be positively impacted by increasing global ridership through focused demand-driving investments, continued success with outreach customers in the U.S., new product momentum with the 2017 motorcycles and very exciting and innovative model year 2018 motorcycles and expansion of the international dealer network.","For the full-year 2017, we expect operating margin as a percent of revenue for the Motorcycles segment to be approximately in line with 2016 operating margin. We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to benefit from pricing of our model year 2017 motorcycles and innovative new products that we will launch throughout the year.","We expect our pricing actions to be largely offset by unfavorable currency exchange, higher raw material costs and increased manufacturing expense. Manufacturing expense will benefit significantly by lapping 2016 costs associated with the implementation \u2013 the ERP implementation in Kansas City and the launch of the Milwaukee-Eight engine.","However, we expect this favorability to be offset by higher depreciation from our recent capital investments and significant start-up costs associated with model year 2018 motorcycles, as we increase the cadence and impact of our new product launches.","To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if foreign currency is held at current levels for the remainder of 2017, we estimate that our expected full-year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 1.25% and our gross margin would be down approximately $20 million to $25 million.","As we work hard to support dealer efforts to sell-through 2016 model year motorcycles, our goal is to substantially reduce retail inventory in Q1 2017 versus Q1 2016. To that end, we plan to ship up to 20% fewer motorcycles in the first quarter compared to last year. This effort will have a substantial impact on the timing of quarterly gross margin in 2017.","We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue in the first quarter to be down approximately 2.5 percentage points versus Q1 last year, and to largely recover the un-favorability during the rest of the year. The primary impacts will include; first, fixed absorption will shift from the first quarter into the back half of the year; and second, mix will be unfavorable in Q1 as we ship fewer 2017 Touring motorcycles to allow U.S. dealers to focus on selling model year 2016 Touring motorcycles. We expect mix favorability to return in Q2.","Looking at SG&A, we expect overall SG&A and SG&A as a percent of revenue to approximately in line with 2016. We believe the benefit of savings from the recent reorganization and the lapping of employee separation expenses will be offset by investments we are making to drive the business forward.","For HDFS, we expect operating income to be down in 2017, primarily driven by lapping the $9 million gain on last year's full securitization. We expect higher interest costs and higher credit losses in 2017 to be partially offset by slight lending rate increase, which we implemented earlier this month. In 2017, we expect to spend $200 million to $220 million in capital.","Finally, we expect full-year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%. Overall, we are thrilled with the incredible response to the new model year 2017 motorcycles, which demonstrates our product innovation leadership and reinforces our strategy to invest in impactful new products.","We're on the right path and are disciplined in our execution of our strategies, and continue to make the necessary decisions intended to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.","Matt?","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, John. As I stated in my opening remarks and as John noted in his comments, while 2016 was a difficult year, we made significant progress on our demand-driving objectives. Our progress and achievements in light of the industry headwinds show we have both the capability and the resolve to compete and win now and in the future. We'll continue our demand-driving focus, but we need to do more, particularly in the U.S. to drive industry growth and assure the vitality of the sport long term.","Our long-term 10-year strategy has the headlining goal to build the next generation of Harley Davidson riders worldwide. To accomplish this in the U.S., we'll focus on growing ridership. Internationally, we'll focus on growing our reach and impact. Globally, we'll focus on growing share and profit and let me underscore that we're going to do both. This is not an or but an and condition, an and condition to drive both creativity and discipline in every business decision we make. Our plan has specific, measurable actions in the short and long-term to build riders, increase access to our products, enhance the impact of our products, grow market share, and generate profits to invest back into the business and return to our shareholders. Our plans leverage our growing capability to drive demand for our sport and brand. This long-term strategy is the next chapter in our company's incredible history.","Now, let me outline how we plan to execute our strategy in the near term. In the U.S, we must attract more new riders to the sport, as the leader in this important market we have a responsibility to assure the long-term vitality of motorcycling here at home. We believe there's untapped potential that exists and we're going after it, with greater emphasis on inspiring and training new riders and encouraging one-time riders to return to the sport.","Now more than ever, we're not only in the business of building great motorcycles, we're in the business of building riders. We'll continue to leverage our capabilities to inspire all types of people to suit up and join in. We know we can do this because we're already successful at it. Between 2010 and 2016, sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to outreach customers in the U.S. grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5% and our mix of retail sales to outreach customers grew from 34% to 40% of the total. Harley-Davidson leads in the sale of motorcycles in every outreach segment, and we expect to build on this capability to powerfully speak to new riders throughout the land, and importantly in urban centers.","We're also going to more fully leverage the used-market opportunity. We know we are reaching new and returning riders who are buying used Harley-Davidson bikes. This is a tremendous gateway into the sport, our brand and our dealerships. We're learning more about the buying behaviors of these customers. And our proprietary research confirms that riders who purchase used bikes through Harley-Davidson dealers have great brand loyalty and a very high repurchase intent. Of those who plan to buy another bike, 9 out of 10 plan to buy another Harley, and 90% of those riders would consider buying new.","We believe embracing the used marketplace more fully has great potential. Since riders connect with the brand through our dealers, we're accelerating our efforts to sharpen and strengthen our dealer network. We know what customers expect at dealerships, online and at events. Our dealers know what it takes to provide best-in-class customer experiences. Our dealers are focused on being high performers and will maximize the potential of the network to strengthen this formidable competitive advantage.","Internationally, our plan to grow our reach and impact with customers remains. We're expanding and enhancing the dealer network to support emerging and developed markets. Our plan is to add 150 to 200 international dealers between 2016 and 2020, and you heard me say earlier that we added 40 new dealerships in 2016, well on our way to our goal.","The Harley-Davidson brand is globally recognized not only for motorcycles, but for the experience we bring to life. We believe we can do more with apparel to accelerate brand awareness and reach internationally.","In our developed markets we led with the motorcycles and apparel was a natural extension. We believe we can leverage apparel now to build brand awareness ahead of the motorcycle in certain emerging markets. We'll continue to invest in the future of our brand, our riders and our sport.","We are placing emphasis on profitability and have strong expectations for returns. We plan to continue to deliver strong financial returns, including Motor Company ROIC that lands within the top quartile of the S&P 500 along with continued strong return on equity for HDFS.","Over the last several years, we've invested in strengthening the capacity, speed and impact of new product development. Projects like Rushmore, Street, LiveWire and most recently the launch of the Milwaukee-Eight engine and the redesigned upgraded suspension on our Touring bikes are all potent examples of Harley-Davidson's growing new product capabilities.","Whether it's a motorcycle that honors our heritage or a project that reaches new customers, our bikes make Harley-Davidson the company it is today and our willingness to push our own boundaries thus far hints to the trajectory of the company we aim to be tomorrow.","Our investments in new product development will enable us to reinvent the product segments we compete in today and push us into new segments. If people were excited about the projects I just named, they haven't seen anything yet. We're entering a new era of product development.","Over the next five years, our plan is to launch 50 new motorcycles that will demonstrate the increasing power and strength of our products to change and enhance the way people view Harley-Davidson. These new motorcycles will both attract new customers and keep our current customers coming back for more, all of this within our existing investment and return profile. That's product development excellence and that's what we mean by increasing the cadence and impact of new products.","Our products are what drive brand loyalty and get people revved up about riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. I've never been more excited about our product pipeline in my 22 years here at Harley-Davidson. Our goal, to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders is ambitious, but as stewards of the most powerful motorcycle brand in the world, we're called to preserve the sport by engaging and inspiring new riders.","I want to be clear, building the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders is a long-term play with long-term value. We will provide results and measurements along the way, but progress won't happen overnight. Our plan is the next chapter in building our company's legacy of fulfilling dreams of personal freedom. We're just as passionate about our customers today as our founders were 114 years ago, and we're making a commitment to the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, the millions of freedom seekers looking for a chance to begin their journey of personal freedom on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.","So, with that, let's take your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Jaime, your line is open.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious about the cadence over the remainder of the year of shipments. It seems like you guys might want to back-end-load the new model year shipments, which would indicate that perhaps the back half of the year would be up at a high single-digit pace rather than try to shove incremental 2017 inventory into the channel in the second quarter. So could you help us think about how we should think about shipments going in over the remainder of the year?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Jaime. This is John. As we look at the overall guidance for the year, we are looking at shipments to be flat to prior year to down modestly. As you noted in the first quarter, we are looking for shipments to be down 15% to 20%, and consequently for the ensuing three quarters, shipments will be up on a year-over-year basis.","The reason we're taking down inventory or taking shipments down in the first quarter is to take overall inventories down. As we look at the U.S. industry going forward, we expect it to be a bit softer. We want to make sure that our inventory is as tight to keep the premium nature of the brand intact, and also to help dealers focus on selling through the model year 2016.","Beyond that, Jaime, I can't give each quarter and the growth that we expect across the ensuing three quarters just to say that we're taking it out of the first quarter, that'll also have an impact on our gross margin cadence throughout the year, and pushing it in the back half, and taking the right action at this point to lower inventories as we exit the first quarter, and we would expect inventories to remain below prior year levels quite a bit through the third quarter.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then that Sportster\/Street segment didn't grow as fast as in the past, and I'm curious if there are any trends you guys are seeing emerging on the low end of the market? I mean average selling prices were up, so that was good, and a lot of that was allocated to the increased demand in Touring bikes, but is there anything changing on that low entry-level where you guys were really gaining traction?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, Jaime, in terms of our product introductions, which we certainly wouldn't share. That segment remains very important for numerous reasons. And in 2015, overall, the segment grew in a market that was down 5.2% \u2013 I'm speaking of United States, in the United States. And so, we continue to \u2013 be a very important segment to us and we'll continue to look at investments as we move forward in the small Cruiser segment.","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","I'll just add to that, yeah, Jaime, that when we talk about these segments, it's becoming increasingly important to think about it in a world of motorcycle sales and demand. And the Street and Sportster segment are significantly more important to the company internationally than they are in the United States. And so, when John talked about making investments, we look at it from a global perspective and not everything we do is going to be a homerun, if you will, in demand in the U.S. but it's in a bigger picture that we're doing it.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Greg, your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the impact, if there was any, of sales for Harley retail sales or the industry from the election? And then what's your expectation for retail sales for the U.S. motorcycle industry in 2017?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Greg. It's really hard to parse out what the election caused prior to the election and after the election. As we look at the \u2013 how the year unfolded in 2016, the industry actually was pretty firm through the first four months and it was in May that the industry started the decline. Whether that had something to do with the election, I'm not sure, but the decline was pretty significant.","And coming out of the election, the industry was not down as much as it was when you look at May through October. But again, Greg, we have no way of parsing out what that is or the consumer uncertainty before or after or what it might be.","So, but in general, as we look forward to 2017, we are certainly concerned about the economic uncertainty that exists around the world. From a macroeconomic, from a political and from a consumer perspective, things are somewhat volatile, and so \u2013 and that's factored into our overall guidance.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then second question, how much do you think your sales were? Can you quantify it anyway from just being low on model year 2017 inventory? And if you had the appropriate levels, maybe how many points of sales do you think that would have added?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Yes. Greg, there is no way for us to quantify that. We certainly know that the amount of product that we had in terms of model year 2017 versus model year 2016 compared to the prior year was significantly lower. And as you recall, the way that 2016 unfolded, the way the market softness hit, we ended up with excess model year 2016 motorcycles and very high inventories","coming out of the third quarter. In fact, they were up 9,700 units. And our focus to reduce that and hit our target, which was flat in the U.S., which we did required us to slow shipments of the product that was selling the best, and in particular the Milwaukee-Eight.","So, we're confident that it did have an adverse impact on retail sales in the fourth quarter. We believe that's going to carry through to the first quarter as we continue to constrain model year 2017 shipments. But Greg, there's absolutely no way to parse that out as a percent.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Gerrick, your line is open.","Gerrick Luke Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. So, of the 26,000 bikes sold at retail in the U.S., how many of those were 2016 models? And how did that ratio look compared to 2015? And similarly, of the 2016 models that are currently in U.S. inventory, what is that rate per dealer? So what's a typical dealer have of 2016's versus everything else right now?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Gerrick. This is John. I won't get into specifics as to what that percentage is, but to say that we exited the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter at historically high levels of carryover product, and again that was how the industry unfolded in 2016. So we had significantly more at both those time periods of model year 2016 in terms of overall inventory. And our goal and our focus is to get them flushed out by the end of the first quarter, and that's one of the reasons that we're taking inventory down in the first quarter is to push that focus on to the sell through of the model year 2016, and we expect to end \u2013 the end of the first quarter in line with historical levels of mix between the new product and the old product.","Gerrick Luke Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joe, your line is open.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello. Thanks for taking the question. The first question is I was wondering if you could just \u2013 I know you provided a little bit of additional color on the gross margin. Can you help us understand exactly the trajectory as we go through the year because I know you mentioned better absorption, but then you also talked about significantly higher launch costs for model year 2018? And it would seem also like commodities might become more and more of a headwind as you go through the year. So, how are you thinking about some of those factors?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Again, looking at full-year gross margin, we would expect it to be in line with 2016 and the positives is really in pricing. So, with the Milwaukee-Eight, we are able to price for that value.","And in addition to that, as we roll out our model year 2018, we would expect addition pricing on that. That price favorability, which is obviously a big benefit to gross margin, will be largely offset. The biggest piece of that offset is with currency, foreign currencies. And we're kind of entering into 2017 in a weak spot. We saw a tremendous devaluation of \u2013 or strengthening of the U.S dollar in the fourth quarter of 7%.","To put that in context, going back to the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.S dollar strengthened 6% in that quarter. So it's actually worse than it was two years ago. So, we're concerned about currency going forward and expect that to be a $20 million to $25 million hit if exchange rates stay at the current spot rate levels as they did in the early part of this year. So, that'll be a detractor from the benefits that we get from pricing.","Secondly is commodities, we do expect to turn a bit unfavorable. We've had a good run with several quarters of favorable year-over-year costs, and we believe that we're starting to see some of those commodities turn a bit of what we believe are the bottoms. So, we would expect some un-favorability.","And then, finally, manufacturing expense, we expect manufacturing expense to be somewhat unfavorable. The biggest driver of that is higher depreciation. And given the investments that we made in 2015 and 2016 in capital, those are coming through in higher depreciation in year-over-year basis in 2017.","And in terms of start-up costs, we hit a lot of startup costs certainly in 2016. And, of course, those will not repeat. However, as we look to model year 2018, we're very excited about that. It is a big model year for us, and it will be \u2013 it will come with significant start-up costs as well. And so those tend to negate each other. And as you look at overall manufacturing expense, the biggest driver on a year-over-year basis is higher depreciation, and that we would expect to be in line in terms of overall gross margin with what we saw in 2016.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right, thanks. And then two quick housekeepings. One, can you tell us what you are targeting U.S. dealer inventory to be down on an absolute basis in the first quarter? And then on the credit side, provision for retail loan losses, it's been like a $8 million to $10 million headwind the past couple of quarters. Do you feel you're properly provisioned now, or should that continue to be a headwind?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Great. Joe, number one, on Q1, we will not give a specific inventory level. As a matter of fact, we don't give any quarter at any time the specific inventories out in the dealer network. Sufficient to say that given the fact that we are taking down our shipments by 15% to 20% on a worldwide basis, we certainly do not \u2013 we expect inventories to be down quite significantly, and it will be a large percentage \u2013 on a large percentage basis at the end of the first quarter. We will hold that inventory out for the ensuing three quarters of 2017 and ending the year at about flat inventories as we exit in the United States. We would expect international inventories to grow as we grow that dealer network.","With regards to the provisions, so as you look at 2016 and the provisions that we built on a year-over-year basis was unfavorable by about $40 million. About a third of that is due to higher provisions for forward-looking losses and to answer your question, Joe, we feel very good about the provisions that we've set up and we've got a very robust process to make sure that we're taking into account everything that's happening in the portfolio and we're providing for the future.","And we feel very good about HDFS business, the portfolio that we have. We are looking at various underwriting changes that we made in oil-dependent areas, but we feel fantastic about the business moving forward and it's very well provided for.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod, your line is open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. You outlined a number of pluses and minuses for 2017 that give us the flat margins. I was hoping to just get a couple details first on what the magnitude of the restructuring savings would be that you are expecting in 2017. I know some of that's offset by some initiatives. And what is the magnitude of the commodity headwinds that you are expecting?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Rod. With regards to the savings, as we had talked about, we took a charge in the quarter of about $18.2 million. We would expect the savings of that largely from employee costs, but other things that we did as well to yield about a $30 million benefit in 2017. If you look at our overall guidance for 2017, Rod, it's flat to prior year, generally in line with prior-year SG&A spending. So, somewhat similar that you saw in 2016, which was flat SG&A, but an increase in our investment in demand-driving activities which in 2015 was nearly $60 million.","2017 will be similar as we are going to see flat SG&A on a full-year basis, but we will spend more on our demand-driving activities, which includes marketing, product development and various growth initiatives that we have that'll pay dividends in 2017 and well into the future. With regards to...","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Go ahead.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","With regards to the commodity costs, we've got an expectation but these are markets. We do our best to hedge in the near term to limit the amount of impact in any given year. We don't have a number to provide. Sufficient to say that \u2013 and you can see it in the fourth quarter, we were flat in the previous quarters. We had generated favorability of about $18 million that we're feeling it turn a bit and we would expect it to be somewhat of a headwind as we move into 2017.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And if I could just follow-up, you mentioned used vehicle pricing being tough. There's obviously a pretty competitive environment and rates are starting to rise. How are you thinking about that vis-\u00e0-vis the pricing strategy on the 2017s? Is that something that is a factor that affects the ability to sustain that strategy? And then just a housekeeping number; on HDFS, what was the reserve as a percentage of receivables at year-end?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","The reserve as a percentage of receivables was just under 2.5%. So, Rod, with regards to the used bike question, if I'm understanding right is we are experiencing softness and the industry is experiencing softness on used bike prices. From an industry perspective, we've been seeing that for eight straight quarters, average overall industry used bike pricing has been falling. We know that puts pressure on the top line.","But you're asking about \u2013 our strategy is to come out with the products that our customers are desiring and to add significant value to those products. Rushmore is a great example, certainly the S models, and most recently, the Milwaukee-Eight Touring bikes. For that, we are pricing for the value of the product \u2013 or the features and benefits that we're adding, and a knock-on effect of that is that when you come out with highly innovative product, it pushes used bike prices down, and we're well aware of that. And not only we're doing it, the industry is doing it and coming out with better product, which is forcing used bike prices down.","In the short term, that does put a headwind on new motorcycle sales for both Harley and the overall industry. But there's a lot of good in the used bikes that Matt mentioned in his opening comments of once we bring a customer in to Harley-Davidson, they're in for the duration. Repurchase intent is over 90%, and that comes with a revenue stream as to whether that individual is riding to Sturgis, stopping in dealerships, buying t-shirts, motor clothes, having their bike serviced and the like using our credit card, being a HOG member and all those things that happen.","So, as we see the softening of used bike prices, it is good for the industry overall because it's bringing new people in that might not have not joined motorcycling. And certainly, in Harley-Davidson in particular, our used bikes act as our value brand, and they are competing against the new products, new motorcycles from our competitors, and again, that customer is with us for a long time.","So, we are seeing this price gap widening, and it's because of the value that we're adding to the motorcycles, and it's just part of that new normal in the United States that we're going to have to work through and compete with. And we feel we did a real good job of that in 2016 by gaining a point of market share, with expanded price gaps to the competition, and expanded price gaps between our new and used product. So with regards to that, we feel pretty good as we move into 2017 and our ability to compete.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig, your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. You have to be pleased with your efforts to train 65,000 new riders, but it does suggest that conversion is not where you want it to be. What can you do to improve conversion rates?","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. This is Matt. It's a good point and I think there's a lot of learning going on throughout the network on that very topic. So first of all, there is an opportunity that we have with capacity at existing dealer points. Second is adding more dealers to the Riding Academy program, and then working with every dealer on ways to improve that conversion including, to John's prior point, considering how used bikes can play a role in that dealership relationship and in that long term relationship with the customers.","So there's a good half a dozen things that are going on that the teams are working on, on that very point. And it's probably one of the higher leverage opportunities that we have to identify the right type of people coming in, make sure they're nurtured through the process, and just to give a quick anecdote, my 17-year-old son took Riding Academy and the comment that instructor made to the entire class at the end when they had all passed, he said, you know, you're not qualified to ride around in a parking lot. So there's a lot more learning and it has to go on to be confident and enjoy riding on the road. And some of these things are part of our thinking to bring into the mix to enhance that conversion rate over time. But we're all over it, and we see it as a tremendous asset that we have that's got a lot more leverage in it.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix, Barclays. Felicia, your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So John, in your prepared remarks you put out a few teasers about 2018. You said the increased cadence, there'd be an increased cadence in frequency of the new product launches. And I know I'd be pushing the wrong buttons if I'd ask you to give us some more color, but you brought it up. So I was wondering if you could say anything about that and perhaps demystify what you meant by increased cadence and frequency. And how you're balancing that with making sure you get enough of those out there, with making sure you don't over-ship. And then also can you just help us think about the U.S. international mix for 2017, how we should model that?","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","All right. I'll start with the second question first. I'll let Matt jump in on the new product cadence.","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","If you can hold me back, John.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","If I can hold you back.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Don't hold back.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","We're very excited about not only model year 2018, but over the next several years. With regards to international mix, as we had mentioned in the overall shipment guidance, which we expect to be flat to down modestly, we do expect the U.S. to be another tough slug in 2017 and we expect the U.S. to be down a bit.","And consequently, we expect the international markets to be up. We feel real good about our international business. And in the core markets within our international business are performing very well. We opened up 40 dealerships in 2016, 20 of those, Felicia, coming in the fourth quarter. And if you take those 20 against the total number of international dealers, that represents a 3% increase in dealerships just in the fourth quarter, which we'll get a benefit certainly of that on a full-year basis in 2017. And we've got a lot more dealerships to come, not only in 2017, but throughout the next several years.","So, in terms of international mix, it will become a bigger part of our mix in 2017. And we expect that to continue on, on an annual basis as we go forward. So, again, we feel very good about our international business, and aside from demonetization and a switchover in Indonesia and the dealer network and pricing in Brazil, we feel very bullish on the international opportunities at Harley-Davidson.","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","So, on product, Felicia, I mentioned 50 new motorcycle models in the next five years. And that's a great number and it's an exciting number. What's more exciting about it is the impact of those products. And the comments that I made about what we've sort of delivered so far at being sort of the leading edge of impact in the marketplace, LiveWire, as a concept, obviously, Rushmore, Street, Milwaukee-Eight and the upgraded suspension being the leading edge of what we mean by impacting both our existing riders in renewing their passion for the sport and the brand, as well as reaching into new segments with some of the more atypical products that are in the portfolio.","We're going talk more about this in our Analyst Day in the future, Q1 that we're working on. So, we'll get into more color about what all that means. But your comment about making sure we get the volume right, Milwaukee-Eight and the suspension are great example of what high-impact products do to drive demand in the market. You're also seeing the incredible discipline that we're bringing to make sure that we keep supply in line with demand. We would love to be and we could be absolutely be shipping more 2017 Touring bikes into the marketplace, and everybody would love the numbers. But we're being very disciplined to make sure that we maintain the right balance of inventory at retail in totality and the right mix, model year to model year, and that's going to be a very important discipline as we go forward, particularly because of the impact in the products that we're going to launch.","And so, there's more to come in this space, but product drives our business. We've done a lot in the last five years to really dial in product development not just throughput, not just the time-to-market, not just the capacity, but our ability to put our finger on the point that's going to move customers at retail with the investments that we make. And I also made the comment in my prepared remarks that we're doing all these within the existing investment and return profile that we're committed to doing it right and getting the right kind of product out there that's going to move the market.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But on the cadence?","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Well, you just have to look historically the sort of pace at which we introduced new models and the impact of those new models and what we're talking about looking forward, 50 new models in the next five years, is the cadence.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I thought you meant changing the cadences in the year. Okay, that's helpful.","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Yes, the cadence of the new product introductions.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. James, your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just maybe a clarification. Obviously a lot of discussion about inventories being too high as we exited 2016, but I think, John, you made a comment that inventories for the full year are going to be I guess flat domestically, up internationally. I guess why does that make sense given that we're too high as we sit here today, that we would finish at this same level? I don't know \u2013 does it assume better retail over the course of the year? How should we think about that?","And then maybe just talk about inventory in terms of inventory turns and sort of what the right amount of inventory is. There's a comment that inventories are going to be down significantly coming out of the first quarter. I'm trying to figure out why that makes sense. Is it just a function of the sales being significantly less or is it somehow that you just feel better about your manufacturing being able to get the bikes out there more quickly, or was maybe last year's Q1 way too high on inventory itself? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, James. I'm glad you mentioned this. If I was unclear, I apologize. We do not believe inventories were too high in the United States as we exited 2016. Our inventories were right on, spot on where we wanted them to be, which was flat versus prior year. So, I apologize if there's any confusion with regards to that.","What we did say and I did say is that the mix of the models or the mix of the inventory that's out in the field at the end of the year is skewed higher than normal to model year 2016 motorcycles, which is a carryover model. We got too many of the older versus the new.","So, with that in the first quarter, we're going to focus on helping the dealer network move those motorcycles through the \u2013 sell through of those motorcycles so that we start out the spring selling season or the beginning of the second quarter with a mix of motorcycles that's in line with historical levels between new model years versus the previous model year.","And again, it's very important to our business model, it's always been our business model that we sell predominantly new where our competition predominantly sells old model years. And because of the way 2016 unfolded, we have too many model year 2016s and we've got a lot of focus to sell those vehicles through in the first quarter. And so consequently, we feel fine about the overall level of inventory as we exit 2016 and we're looking to keep U.S. inventories flat in 2017 as well.","I think that's \u2013 anything else James? Did I miss anything?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Tim, your line is open.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and thank you, gentlemen, for the color here on the call today. Matt, if you could maybe expand a little bit on your comment about embracing the used market. What changes are you thinking about that you can share with us related to that? And how does that play into your prior commentary on used prices?","And then, John, just a housekeeping item. Accounts receivable up pretty substantially in Q4; just any color on that if you would.","Matthew S. Levatich - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So, I think we just have to all kind of step back and recognize the tremendous value that the used bike marketplace plays in our business. We have timeless, classic, durable, awesome motorcycles that last a long time and they're part of a consideration set that customers have when they're looking at a new or different motorcycle.","The simple idea here is to just wrap our arms around that because the statistics I shared from our proprietary research about the degree to which the loyalty and commitment exists in our used buyers for, A, another Harley; and B, a new Harley is a tremendous gateway into the brand and right now it's just part of the business that sort of happens that we don't spend a lot of time talking about on this call or with our investors, but it's a very important dynamic that we think if we wrap our arms around we can make better use of. So, that's what's behind it and there's going to be more to come on that, we're just formulating what all that means and how we move forward, but it's something that's very important to our business in the long term.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","And Tim, with regards to accounts receivable, accounts receivables were up at year-end by 15%. Remember when you look at our balance sheet, accounts receivables are international motorcycles. All the domestic stuff goes over to HDFS and is accounted for there. So, when we look at that 15%, that was driven by motorcycle shipments. If you look at the split of motorcycle shipments within the quarter, motorcycle shipments were also up 15%. And so, it makes sense that receivables were up 15% as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. David, your line is open.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, hi. Thanks for the question. Just a really quick one about the impact or possible impact of proposed policy changes, I was wondering if you could help investors sort of frame the percentage of production in the U.S. you guys do that's exported. And on the other side of the equation, what percentage of your COGS are internationally sourced versus primarily U.S. sourced? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thanks, David. With all the talk with regards to potential policy changes, we believe that Harley Davidson is extremely well situated. Whether you're talking about corporate tax policy, infrastructure investment and then some of the foreign trade things that \u2013 or tariffs that might ensue.","To answer your question is, the absolute vast majority of everything is made in the United States, manufactured in the United States and exported. We do a little bit of what we call CKD, which is complete knock down, in Brazil and India where we ship in parts and they assemble, and then a little bit of manufacturing of Street motorcycle in India. But the significant majority of our production as well as the majority of inputs into that production are coming from and sourced in the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Woolf with Northcoast Research. Seth, your line is open.","Seth Woolf - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious. I think in the comments you referred to 1Q as having an adverse mix because of Touring shipments. So I guess when you try to clean up the inventory or right-size it, you're talking about principally a U.S. shipment reduction. I was wondering if you could just give us any color on what's going to happen internationally; help us with the model.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Yes. Good question, Seth. Most of what we're talking about in terms of lower shipments in are driven by the U.S. market. International markets, we do not expect a change in shipment patterns. And again, over the course of the year, we would expect inventories to grow modestly based on the increase in the overall dealer network. But what we are referring to when we talk about the lower inventories and lower shipments is driven predominantly by the United States. And with regards to the mix, it's very difficult to take the best-selling product that you have, and we're going to soften the mix of that a little bit more in the first quarter because the predominance of the carryover is in model year 2016 Touring motorcycles, and that will have an adverse impact on mix in the quarter and ultimately gross margin for the quarter.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David, your line is open.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for squeezing us in here at the end. Just wanted to get your take on any potential market share gains or room to take shares. You've seen a competitor announce that they are going to be winding down one of their product cycle, or products if you will. If you think that there's some opportunity at least there for you from a U.S. retail perspective to gain that share or not? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Thank you, David. David, we couldn't be more pleased with market share in the fourth quarter and market share on a full-year basis that we gained back by spending on equity driven things and not price discounting. So, overall, we feel great about market share. When you look at the exit of Victory Motorcycle, all we can say is that we compete for every customer that's out there. And we welcome folks that have ridden Victory Motorcycles to come over to the Harley family and join the lifestyle that we have here, and we're very happy to compete for those customers going forward.","Amy Giuffre - Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Yes, we are.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","","Thank you, Tanya, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Harley-Davidson's third-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. The audio for our calls is webcast live on harleydavidson.com and you can access the supporting slides on that site by clicking About Harley-Davidson at the bottom of the homepage, then Investor Relations and Events and Presentations.","This morning, Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund, will provide their perspectives on the quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","With that, let\u2019s get started, Keith?","Keith Wandell","","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call, and thanks for your interest and investment in Harley-Davidson.","As we noted in today\u2019s earnings release, the third-quarter financials were in line with our expectations. Our business and financials are strong through nine months, with year-over-year consolidated revenue up while net income and EPS grew double digits.","Retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles grew 3.8% worldwide and 3.4% in the U.S., which topped extremely strong sales in last year\u2019s third quarter. You\u2019ll recall that the launch of our initial Project Rushmore motorcycles in last year\u2019s third quarter drew one of our largest single quarter retail increases in recent years. They were up 15.5% worldwide and 20.1% in the U.S. John is going to cover those details in more detail in a few minutes. ","A strong contributor to this year\u2019s third quarter retail lift was the roll out of our great line up of 2015 motorcycles in late August. Today, we have 36 models in our product line up. There are seven new Project Rushmore motorcycles, including three Road Glides, that mark the return of this popular bike. ","With world-class aerodynamics, ergonomic fit, passenger comfort, and infotainment and audio performance, Road Glide builds on the momentum from last year\u2019s Rushmore launch. These bikes underscore our commitment to delivering amazing motorcycles through customer-led design and the response has been great.","From introduction through the end of the quarter, the new Road Glide models were the best selling 2015 Harleys, and along with continued strong demand for Street Glides and Ultras, they contributed to exceeding the strong sales in the year-ago quarter. Other new Rushmore models include the CVO Street Glide, the Electra Glide Ultra, Classic Low and Ultra Limited Low and the Freewheeler, a trike that\u2019s all about hot rod attitude on three wheels.","Leading up to the 2015 launch, the model year changeover in our plants was the smoothest in recent history, which speaks to our many advances on the manufacturing front and the continued strong results in operating performance. Further driving retail was a rebound in Sportster sales, as well as increased availability of the Street 750 and 500. The response to Street has been extremely positive.","In India, three out of every four Harleys sold in the third quarter were Street, and in Southern Europe, Street has also been performing very well. And Street is reaching the target audiences in the U.S., both outreach customers and those new to the Harley-Davidson brand. We are excited to begin expanding Street distribution to other international markets in late 2014.","We also see great opportunity with Street in our Riding Academy, where enrollment is up this year and bringing new riders into the brand. We believe this bodes well for our strategy of having riders learn on an authentic Harley that they can actually buy. ","And then, there is Project LiveWire. Starting in the third quarter, we\u2019ve taken the Project LiveWire fleet of electric motorcycles on the road, giving more than 3,000 demo rides to a broad mix of Harley and non-Harley riders alike. By a wide margin, those taking a LiveWire demo have told us the experience exceeded their expectations and they\u2019d be interested in buying one.","Project Rushmore, Street and LiveWire all demonstrate how we are staying true to our roots while broadening our reach to new riders worldwide offering cutting-edge products and features in today\u2019s motorcycles and exploring tomorrow\u2019s.","We continue to see the success of our product manufacturing and retail strategies, which are delivering an outstanding customer experience, driving bottom-line improvement and expanding the reach of the brand. Through nine months, sales to our U.S. outreach customers have grown more than twice the rate of sales to core customers. In the third quarter, our share of 601-cc plus U.S. market was a strong 56.3%, the highest to-date this year.","International retail sales were up 4.8% for the quarter and the Asia-Pacific market has double-digit growth in both the quarter and year-to-date. Fueling Asia-Pacific\u2019s growth were India, China, and other emerging markets in the region.","Another indicator of brand strength and connection, H.O.G. membership, is up worldwide and strong in established markets and new markets alike. H.O.G. membership in EMEA hit an all-time high in September.","So, all-in-all, we\u2019ve achieved a lot so far this year and we\u2019re on track for a year of growth and strong financial performance in 2014.","In closing, I want to acknowledge the outstanding work and commitment of our employees, our more than 1,450 dealers in 90 countries and our suppliers. Their efforts to keep the customer at the forefront of all we do and to continuously take our products and customer experience to the next level are key to Harley-Davidson\u2019s strong market leadership.","Now I\u2019m going to turn it over to John with details on the quarter.","John Olin","","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As we anticipated, our third-quarter key financial metrics were down versus prior year. This is a result of a planned shipment reduction to address retail inventory that increased behind soft retail sales in the second quarter. Despite the impact of our shipment adjustment, the business continued to perform extremely well with new product momentum, strong productivity, and focused spending. On a year-to-date basis, EPS is up 20.1%.","With that as background, let\u2019s discuss our Q3 results on slide 11. During the third quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.30 billion, net income in the quarter was $150.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69 per share.","Operating income for the Motorcycle segment was $146.3 million, 16.6% lower compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. The decrease in motorcycle business was driven by a 4.2% decrease in revenue behind a 6.2% lower shipments. Motorcycle segment operating income was also impacted by a lower gross margin percent and higher year-over-year SG&A spending.","At Harley-Davidson Financial Services, operating income was up modestly year-over-year. Also, during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt in February. We are pleased with the strength of the business through the first nine months of the year. We continue to run the business for the long-term and focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at third quarter performance, starting with retail sales on slide 12. We are very excited to report that Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 3.8% over last year\u2019s very strong increase of 15.5%. This quarter\u2019s results were driven by increases in both the U.S. and international markets. As we exited the third quarter, we believe our brand is rock solid and core demand fundamentals were strong as ever, evidenced by solid market share performance, strong U.S. outreach results, a healthy mix of new-to-brand customers and a shorter repurchase cycle.","Third quarter worldwide retail sales also reflected retail momentum throughout the quarter driven by continued strength of our 2014 model year motorcycles and the highly successful introduction of our 2015 model year. During the fourth quarter, we expect continued worldwide retail sales momentum behind Street, Road Glide, and the complete line of Rushmore motorcycles.","On slide 13, let\u2019s review the U.S. market where third-quarter retail sales were up 3.4% compared to prior year. We believe the factors that benefited U.S. retail sales during the quarter were; first, the original eight Rushmore models we launched last year continue to be highly successful at retail this year; second, a strong 2015 model year launch, including the return of Road Glide. The sales were great with the initial Road Glide motorcycles turning very quickly when they hit the dealerships. In addition, we had very positive response from our new Low Touring models, the Freewheeler trike, and of course, CVO Street Glide.","Third, retail sales were robust with improved availability in the third quarter. Early purchaser surveys suggest Street is attracting outreach customers that are new to the Harley-Davidson brand. This is in line with our product strategy and supports our expectations that a majority of Street sales will be incremental.","And fourth, as we anticipated, Sportster motorcycle sales rebounded in the U.S. following retail softness in the first half of the year. We believe the pre-announcement of Street may have caused some customers to hold off their purchases until they could compare the varying features and benefits of Street and Sportsters. We believe that each of these platforms addresses distinct customer needs evidenced by the fact that Sportster sales grew in Q3 and Street sold also very well. ","Now, turning to the market share in the U.S. During the quarter, we had a strong market share of 56.3%. Market share was largely flat to prior year despite lapping significant year-ago share gains and continued headwinds from the absence of Road Glide for most of the quarter.","Through the first nine months, U.S. retail sales were up 1.9% and market share decreased 1.1 percentage points compared to last year. During the third quarter, there was significant progress in bringing dealer inventory in line with demand.","Our dealers\u2019 efforts to sell through 2014 model year motorcycles have been very successful. As we have discussed many times, we are committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand as demonstrated by the reduction in our shipment guidance last quarter.","Quarter-end inventory was up approximately 4,000 motorcycles compared to last year, due in part to initial dealer fill of Street models for retail. We continue to expect U.S. year-end retail inventory to be up moderately from 2013 levels, driven primarily by the addition of the new Street platform.","On slide 14, you\u2019ll see retail sales in our international markets were up 4.8% in the third quarter. In the EMEA region, Q3 retail sales were up 1.7%, driven by growth in the U.K., Spain, and France. During the first nine months of 2014, our 601+cc market share in Europe was 12.0%, down 0.6 percentage points versus the same period last year. Year-to-date share was down 0.6 points as we lapped year-ago share gains and on the introduction of several performance orientated competitive models.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 12.8% in Q3. Retail sales in emerging markets within the region were up significantly, driven by India where retail sales tripled during the quarter as a result of very robust demand for the new Street motorcycles.","The Latin America region was up 7.0% during the quarter, driven by very strong growth in Mexico, partially offset by a modest decline in Brazil. We remain cautious on the Brazilian market as it continues to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty, and very aggressive price competition.","Retail sales in Canada were down 5.8% in the third quarter where we believe currency-driven price increases negatively impacted retail sales. Since 2009, we have added 126 new international dealer points to our distribution network. We believe that we can continue to realize strong international growth opportunities by expanding our distribution network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street.","On slide 15, you\u2019ll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 6.2% compared to last year as we adjusted our production after a softer-than-expected second quarter. Third quarter shipments finished within our expected shipment range of 49,000 to 54,000 motorcycles. ","During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 2.5 percentage points from prior year, as Rushmore models continued to stimulate demand in the market. Also, during the quarter, shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 3.8 percentage points as we ramped up Street production through the quarter.","With our Street start-up issues largely behind us, we have reached our expected production run rate and we continue to expect a significantly higher shipment mix of Street and Sportster motorcycles in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.","On slide 16, you\u2019ll see revenue for the Motorcycles & Related Products segment was down 4.2% in the third quarter behind a 6.2% decrease in shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $228 from the year ago quarter, primarily driven by higher pricing and favorable mix. ","On average, our key currencies in the third quarter were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 1% compared to 2013.","During the quarter, we introduced our new 2015 model year motorcycles. Wholesale and MSRP prices have increased by an average of about 1%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing, net of cost, was up 0.5 percentage point expressed as a percentage of revenue.","Parts & Accessories sales were down 4.2% in the third quarter, due to lower accessory shipments, as we lapped the initial sell-in of Project Rushmore accessories in last year\u2019s third quarter. General merchandise sales were up 4.8% during the quarter. The increase was driven by strong international sales, partially offset by lower U.S. sales, as we move forward with our aggressive SKU reduction plan to help focus dealers on fast-moving products and to improve the customer experience with a more targeted assortment of popular styles.","On slide 17, you\u2019ll see gross margin in the quarter was 34.9%, which was down 0.4 percentage points compared to last year. While gross margin in the quarter was impacted by unfavorable volumes, currency, raw materials and manufacturing costs, margins were not down as much as we anticipated as we experienced better-than-expected mix and manufacturing performance.","During the third quarter, mix was a benefit of $13.7 million, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. While motorcycle family mix was unfavorable driven by higher Street shipments, the mix of models within the families was favorable, as customers continued to trade up the higher content models.","Also driving favorability in the quarter was a much richer mix of parts and accessories and general merchandise products. For the fourth quarter, we expect mix to be adversely impacted by an increase in Street shipments from Q3 levels as we now produce at planned rates throughout the fourth quarter.","Foreign currency exchange was $11.5 million unfavorable for the quarter. This was driven by significant weakening of our key currencies within the third quarter. The euro, yen, Brazilian real, and Australian dollar devalued an average of approximately 7% from the beginning to the end of the quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revaluation of foreign-denominated assets on the balance sheet.","Our manufacturing costs in Q3 were unfavorable by $3.3 million, driven by lost absorption on lower year-over-year production. Manufacturing costs did finish better than expected behind strong productivity gains and lower-than-expected Street start-up costs in the quarter.","On slide 18, operating margin, as a percent of revenue, for the third quarter was 12.9%, down 2.0 percentage points compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Operating income of $146.3 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending.","SG&A was adversely impacted by two recalls announced during the third quarter, which resulted in a one-time charge of approximately $14 million. Excluding recall costs, SG&A spending was lower on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the timing of expenses, which we expect will shift into the fourth quarter.","Going forward, we will remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible, and more profitable.","Now, moving on to our Financial Services segment on slide 19. In the third quarter, HDFS\u2019 operating profit of $77.8 million was 2.2% higher than last year. The two primary factors impacting third quarter results were; first, net interest income was favorable $4.9 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition; and second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable by $7.7 million due to higher retail credit losses, an increase in the reserve rate and growth in retail receivables.","Going forward, we continue to expect pressure on HDFS\u2019 operating income as a result of modestly higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing costs.","Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS\u2019 operations on slide 20. Larry?","Larry Hund","","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 4.3% or $35.4 million compared to the same period last year. The higher originations were driven by increased new U.S. motorcycle sales and a higher average amount financed. HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was largely flat at 59.7% in the third quarter of 2014.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 7.9% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. HDFS continues to provide loans in both the prime and sub-prime segments. Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our retail loan originations were prime. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans in both segments.","Moving on to credit performance on slide 21, the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 3.0%, which was favorable compared to the third quarter of 2013 rate of 3.11%. This was the lowest third quarter 30-day delinquency rate in the last 13 years.","However, as we anticipated, annual retail credit losses for the first nine months increased by 20 basis points to 1.08% compared to 2013, due to lower recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, the impact of changing consumer behavior, and lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years.","During the third quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position, delivered solid credit performance, and contributed strong profitability. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to John.","John Olin","","Thanks, Larry. Now, let\u2019s take a look at cash and liquidity on slide 22. You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.04 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had approximately $1.6 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the third quarter, HDFS successfully completed a $600 million medium-term note offering with a coupon rate of 2.4%. In addition, we renewed our $600 million U.S. conduit facility. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.6 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $169.6 million during the quarter.","As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases.","Now, I\u2019ll review the remaining HD Inc. financials on slide 23. I would like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, we generated operating cash of $966.9 million through the first nine months of 2014. Operating cash flow was up $141.8 million from last year, primarily driven by lapping of last year\u2019s pension contribution of $175 million and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations. And second, our year-to-date tax rate was 34.9% compared to 34.3% in the year-ago period. The higher tax rate reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2014.","On slide 24, you\u2019ll see our overall expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to ship 270,000 to 275,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis in 2014, up approximately 3.5% to 5.5% from 2013 shipments.","During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 46,500 and 51,500 motorcycles, which is flat to up 10% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter shipments of 46,618 motorcycles. We also continue to expect 2014 operating margin for the Motorcycle segment will be between 17.5% and 18.5%, up from 16.6% in 2013. We believe 2014 operating margin will benefit from a modest increase in gross margin and from SG&A falling as a percent of revenue.","For HDFS, we continue to expect operating income to be down modestly in 2014 compared to 2013. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be between $215 million and $235 million. And finally, we now expect our full-year 2014 effective tax rate to be approximately 35.0%, down 0.5 percentage point from prior guidance, due to a higher projected benefit from the U.S. manufacturing deduction.","So, to recap, during the quarter, we experienced increased retail sales and delivered solid market share despite extremely strong year-ago comps; further raised the new product bar with the introduction of our 2015 model year motorcycles; increased retail availability of Street motorcycles in the U.S., India, and Southern Europe; and delivered shareholder value through dividends and repurchase of $170 million in company shares.","As we look forward, we feel great about our brand, the business\u2019 core demand fundamentals, our ability to leverage the company\u2019s cost structure and the success we are experiencing with our key growth strategies.","We will continue to position the company for long-term success by investing in growth through new products, expanding brand relevance to more customers in both the U.S. and abroad, and through international expansion. We will remain focused on delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let\u2019s take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Our first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","","Two questions, I guess. First, on currency, I mean obviously there is a lot of concern among investors about what a strengthening U.S. dollar might mean for Harley competitively and also from a gross margin perspective. So, perhaps you could talk about that maybe longer term into 2015 on the competitive structure on the gross margin. And then, secondarily, it sounds like the Street is doing really, really well overseas and I\u2019m just wondering how many we\u2019re going to produce in India this year and kind of what is the capacity constraint on the India manufacturing plants?","John Olin","","Let\u2019s start with our currency. In the third quarter, we did see a little bit of devaluation on a year-over-year basis, which was unfavorable to revenue by about $1.8 million. The biggest brunt of the decline year-over-year was the revaluation as we saw a lot of inter-quarter devaluation. So, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, if currencies stay where they exited the third quarter, we would expect an impact to revenue in the 1.5% to 2% range. Now, some of that is hedged. So we do expect currency to be unfavorable in the fourth quarter, not to the same extent that we saw in the third quarter, but some pretty significant unfavorability.","And then, as we move into 2015, it really depends on what happens to overall currencies. As we\u2019ve discussed, we do hedge. We hedge typically out four quarters in a stair-step fashion. So we\u2019ve got the most coverage on in the in-quarter, which would be the fourth quarter in this situation, and it kind of steps down over the ensuing three quarters. So, if things don\u2019t change from here, there will be significant currency headwinds next year, which will affect revenue primarily, and then, that will be somewhat offset by the hedge positions that we have.","The second question that you had, Sharon, is with regards to Street and sales overseas. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the way Street is selling both in the U.S. and overseas. As Keith had mentioned, three out of four motorcycles in India are Street. In addition, during the third quarter, we sold more Street motorcycles internationally than we did domestically, and that\u2019s even taking into consideration that distribution in the U.S. was a little bit light.","So, as we look forward, what we\u2019re going to do is start to expand Street to our other markets around the world. We\u2019ll start late in the fourth quarter and shipping a few hundred units into Europe and start to get that dealer network ready. We\u2019ll be in full production for Europe in the dealer fill in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we\u2019ll expand to Japan, China, Australia, and Mexico in the beginning of 2015, and then towards the end of 2015 into 2016, we\u2019ll expand to the rest of our international markets. And from a capacity standpoint, we certainly have the capacity to meet that rollout plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","","Two questions really. One, I was wondering if you could give some indication as to the percent mix between \u201814 and \u201815 model year on, I guess, on the sales, but really more specifically on the current inventory situation in the U.S. And then the second question is, I was wondering if you can quantify some of the hits to gross margin in the quarter from some of the subvention you did with the financing deals during the quarter.","John Olin","We don\u2019t break out sales between model years within the quarter. I guess certainly we like to stress is that overall retail sales were very strong in the third quarter, especially in the United States where we\u2019re getting over a comp of up 20%. We did end the quarter with inventories heading in the right direction. Remember, we took inventory out after a soft second quarter and are focused on making sure that we maintain an incredibly strong brand and an incredibly strong dealership and limit discounting in the best fashion that we can and that\u2019s through managing inventory in line with demand.","We did see inventories fall and we exited with retail inventories up 4,000 units and a lot of those being Street dealer fill. So we made great progress in getting the inventories where we want them to be. By the time we\u2019re out of the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be right back in line with our original plan, which is to have inventories up modestly behind on the Street dealer fill. When you look at overall 2014 versus 2015, carryover is a little bit heavier this year than it was last year, and again, by year end we\u2019d expect to have that in line.","The second question was the impact of some of the subvention that we\u2019ve done on the financials I believe. First of all, let me give a kind of an idea what we did do. In line with making sure that we limit discounting in the network as much we can, we help -- supported our dealers through offering two finance programs with No Money Down and a limited lower rate financing program. They were only offered to our very top tier customers.","Through the quarter, they represented sales of about 5% of the motorcycles in the United States, so it didn\u2019t impact a whole lot of sales. We don\u2019t believe there was a big incremental impact on sales in general, however, it was effective in limiting discounting as well as moving out model year 2014 motorcycles, and the overall hit to the financials was very nominal. Again, it wasn\u2019t on a lot of volume. It\u2019s included in the Q3 results and you\u2019re talking in the probably $2 million to $3 million range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison - Robert W. Baird","Maybe Larry I\u2019ll ask you the question on the sub-prime market. There have been more and more concerns about that particular market. Are you seeing any divergence in how sub-prime tiers are performing? Number one. And then, secondly, you commented that there were lower recovery values. Could you comment on used bike values and whether maybe your production cut has helped stabilize that market?","Larry Hund","First, on the sub-prime market, I think what we\u2019ve seen is sort of what we\u2019ve expected for a period of time, which is, is that market I would say is just starting to normalize. Sub-prime credit had absolutely tremendous performance if you kind of look back at 2011 and \u201812 as far as very, very low levels of delinquency and loss. We think sub-prime is still very attractive. It\u2019s performing very well compared to our models and we are priced for it. But as we expected, we are seeing credit losses starting to, I\u2019ll call it, normalize and increase somewhat in that market.","Second regarding lower recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, I think you are seeing a couple of impacts there. I think Harley-Davidson dealers are taking a lot of trades with all the Rushmore product there selling, so that their need for purchasing repossessed motorcycles at the auctions has declined versus where it was a year ago because they feel they have sufficient inventory of used bikes that they are getting from the trade market, so that\u2019s put a little bit of downward pressure on recovery values. I think it will be interesting to see how that plays out over the next six, nine months as we go into next year\u2019s riding season. Hopefully, that\u2019s bottomed out, but I think too early to call that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Just a few questions. First, housekeeping, just wanted to make sure I was doing some simple math properly. On the $14 million recall expense you highlighted, I\u2019m getting that that was about $0.04 impact to your earnings in the quarter. Second, John, thank you for the color on SG&A. You said that some expenses will shift into the fourth quarter. So, with that in mind, how should we think of SG&A in the fourth quarter? We\u2019re estimating that it\u2019s flat year-over-year. Just maybe some color there. And then, finally, Larry, we just talked about HDFS and your percentage of prime and sub-prime, and I\u2019m just wondering, first, could you just tell us what percentage of non-HDFS financed bikes you think are purchased with cash? And then, if you take your share of those purchases with cash, isn\u2019t it fair to say that your prime profile, if you include cash, is closer to about 90%? Thank you.","John Olin","Okay. Felicia, this is John. Your math is correct. $14 million would be in the neighborhood of $0.04 on EPS for the quarter. And with regards to SG&A, so SG&A was up this quarter and if you take out the one-time recall, we\u2019re actually about $6 million favorable and what we believe is that $6 million is all timing and that will shift into the fourth quarter. We said all year long that we expected SG&A to be up on a year-on-year business, but fall as a percentage of revenue, and with that, we would expect our fourth-quarter SG&A spending to be up probably in the 3% to 5% range.","Larry Hund","So then on prime, sub-prime, this is probably anecdotal because we don\u2019t have perfect information on cash. We\u2019ve always estimated that about 20% of sales are cash. Now, once again, you never know is that coming from a home equity line of credit or some other source, but roughly we\u2019ve always thought that that\u2019s about right. And regarding our mix, you\u2019re right. We do a lot of prime financing, but we are a full credit spectrum lender, and if you look, we\u2019ve been fairly consistent around this 80\/20 mix of prime, sub-prime in loans we financed for a good number of years now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital","I was wondering on Street, your original guidance was about 7,000 to 10,000 shipped in the year, I was wondering if that still holds or if you\u2019ve tightened that up, and maybe how many were shipped in the quarter? And then second question, your Rushmore has been great. We\u2019ve seen a bounce back in Sportsters, but maybe just some conversation as to why Dyna and Softail still a little bit weak? Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks, Gerrick. This is John. [technical difficulty] we still feel very good about that. No change there. And then, with regards to the custom segment, so over the last several quarters, when we show our shipment as a percentage of total, we\u2019ve certainly seen that custom has been down and that is nothing less than what we expected, right? We\u2019ve been investing in the Rushmore line of products and also in the Street, and we would expect both of those to go faster than the custom segment, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in the overall shipments.","And the other thing is, and important to note, when we look at our custom motorcycles, when we came out with Rushmore in line with our Fatten the Tail strategy, it\u2019s purpose was to encourage people to trade up and we are seeing that and we\u2019re seeing folks that have been on our custom motorcycles trading up to products like Street and Street is viewed by customer as a custom motorcycle - sorry Street Glide and now Road Glide, and so we are seeing those folks trade up to our Rushmore product, which is in line with the strategy and certainly more profitable for us.","So, overall what we\u2019re seeing in custom is what we expected, and also to note with regards to custom segment or the large cruiser segment, in the third quarter, as well as on a year-to-date basis, we picked up share of that market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Congrats on a real strong quarter here. John, maybe you could just help us peel back the layers on the gross margin a little bit. You talked about it being down 250 bps headed into the quarter. I'm assuming that currency only pushed you in the wrong direction. You finished down just 40 bps. Firstly, can you quantify the balance sheet devaluation in the third quarter like you have done a couple of times in the past? And then just maybe walk us through some of the individual items. It seems like there was a pretty sizable delta versus how you were thinking about mix in some of these other items. Could you just walk us through why those were so much different than you thought heading into the quarter?","John Olin","","Absolutely, James. Let\u2019s start with the currency piece. Again, when you break up the components of currency, $1.8 million was unfavorable on the revenue line and that leaves $9.7 million unfavorable, largely driven by the devaluation. As a matter of fact, the devaluation marking the foreign-denominated assets was a little bit greater than that and partially offset from some favorable hedge performance that we had on in the quarter. And net debt is unfavorable $11.5 million, which did impact gross margin by about nine-tenths of a gross margin point and you\u2019re right that\u2019s more than we had anticipated going the other way.","The other part of your question, James, was - is that we did expect gross margin to be more unfavorable than it was. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased to see that to be wrong. But it was really driven by the two pieces. One is mix, and we did expect the mix to be unfavorable in aggregate for the quarter and it ended up being strongly favorable at $13.7 million.","And let me go through the pieces of that very quickly, is we\u2019ve talked about the varying pieces of mix and family mix is typically the biggest driver of overall mix, and that\u2019s a mix between the various families that we have. That was unfavorable as we anticipated in the quarter and that goes back to seeing that Street percentage of total shipments rise to 3.8% -- increase of 3.8 percentage points. And it did rise and that was unfavorable.","Where we were pleasantly surprised is in two other areas of mix, one being model mix and we\u2019re seeing strong model mix over the last several quarters and expected that to temper a little bit as we lapped Rushmore on a year-over-year basis, and those are our customers that are trading up within a family and buying higher trim or higher content models, and so that\u2019s a customer buying an Ultra Limited versus an Ultra or Street Glide Special versus a Street Glide. They continue to be very strong in their trading up the higher trim models, again which is a great thing.","And then the last piece of mix that was very favorable that we didn\u2019t anticipate was Related Products mix and that\u2019s in both Parts & Accessories and General Merchandise, and customers just choosing a higher mix of products. For example, in General Merchandise, higher profit leathers and riding gear, and in Parts & Accessories, chassis products, suspension and braking products.","The other area of favorability was in manufacturing expense. While it was unfavorable in [indiscernible] by $3.3 million, we anticipated to be more unfavorable driven by lower production and that lower production is due to us taking out the 9,000 units. Again, however, we had very strong productivity and the plants have been doing a wonderful job, the overall operations have been doing fantastic for the last several quarters and the third quarter was no different, a little bit better than we had anticipated and also Street start-up costs. We talked about last quarter, expected them to be about $5 million. They are a little bit shy of $3 million. So, we feel very good about how the team has dealt with that, and as I mentioned in the preamble, we put the start-up issues behind us and we\u2019re running at full production for Street.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","","Thank you and congrats to everyone on a great execution in the quarter here. Couple of things, John. If you could just revisit here the company-level inventories built here. Can you talk about what's behind that? And then, collectively, just to confirm, I think you just said it though, but you're pretty well done with the Street start-up cost supplier issues, so just to confirm that? And then, two others, real quickly here. The Street, how much did you get into Europe, if any at all, during the quarter? That would seem like it would continue to help what could be a little bit of economic headwinds? And then, finally, any update on timing of LiveWire? You had it in the slide deck, you said your reception was much better than expected in the past. Just any update on the timeline there? Thank you.","John Olin","First question was company-level inventory, yes, if you look on our balance sheet, inventories are up probably in the 15% range. That is driven by finished goods inventory, partially offset by general merchandise inventory being down. We talked about general merchandise, as we prune SKUs, we expect that inventory to come down and it is.","We do have higher company-owned inventory, finished goods inventory on a year-over-year basis and that\u2019s for the sole reason of is, we\u2019re working off the model year 2014 and aggressively managing the supply of units out in the field and so we held back a few thousand motorcycles and those will get shipped in the fourth quarter here.","Next question was Street start-up costs. Street start-up issues are largely behind us. We do expect some nominal start-up costs in the fourth quarter, but nothing that we would expect to even need to report on, but we are running at speed, at originally planned speed at this point, and while a lot of the third quarter - we didn\u2019t have full distribution which probably impacted retail sales, we will be fine by the time we end the year and be ready for the selling season in the United States as well as in international markets.","With that, we would expect the mix of Street in the fourth quarter to increase a fair amount from what we saw from the third quarter as well because we will be producing at full run and again expect that to have an adverse impact on Q4 mix.","The next piece is Street in Europe. We have been shipping into Europe from the initial onset in the Southern European countries of Italy, Spain, and Portugal. We have not shipped beyond those in the third quarter. We do anticipate to ship a couple to a few hundred units here in the fourth quarter, but very nominal overall volumes in Europe. As I had mentioned, most of the shipments for the dealer fill will take place early in 2015.","And then, your fourth question was the timing of LiveWire. We\u2019re still kind of where we talked about the last time we talked is we\u2019re gathering consumer feedback as Keith had mentioned the feedback has been absolutely fantastic. Our plans is to take the demos and expand them from the United States, which we\u2019ve been doing this year and will do the balance of this year, into Europe and Canada in 2015 and so, Tim, we\u2019re going to continue to collect feedback and make sure we understand the requirements of a great electric motorcycle and then we\u2019ll make a decision at that point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Hovorka from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joe Hovorka - Raymond James","Just a couple quick questions. One can you give what Road Glide was, as a percentage of retail, in the third quarter \u201813 and then what it was in the third quarter of \u201814? And then, if I use your 56.3% market share of the 600+cc market, it looks like you sold at retail a little bit fewer than 700 Street 500s. One, I wanted to make sure that number was correct. And two, if I recall, there was almost 1,700 in the second quarter at retail. What's the delta there? I'm surprised that it's gone down by that much?","John Olin","The first question is Road Glide, so as I had mentioned, Road Glide, it still represented a headwind in the third quarter even though it is actually our fastest turning product coming out and meeting all our expectations. A year ago, third quarter, we had 8% of U.S. sales were Road Glide. This year\u2019s third quarter, about half that amount, about 4% is in Road Glide. So we\u2019re coming up to speed and you look at the third quarter, really an inflection point.","So for the three previous quarters, the absence of Road Glide has been a pretty stiff headwind and as we start to move forward over the ensuing four quarters, we would expect a nice tailwind from Road Glide. But in the third quarter, we sold about half as many this year\u2019s third quarter as we did last year\u2019s third quarter.","With regards to the overall Street, we don\u2019t provide a break out of the 500 to 700 and to be honest, the 500 to 750, to be honest, I didn\u2019t completely follow the math, but I think the answer to your question is in the first half of the year, and in particular the second quarter, we shipped a fair amount of 500s in for the Rider Academy training, and they were all shipped by the end of the first half and what you\u2019ve seen in the second half is 500s for consumer use. And if there\u2019s -- any other questions, you can follow up with Amy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on that question, as well as just overall in the fourth quarter. What are some of the puts and takes, obviously, Road Glide becomes a tailwind and you have much easier comparisons in the fourth quarter than you did in the third quarter, but what are some of the other factors we should think about when we are modeling out retail sales for next quarter?","John Olin","Overall, I think we\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of retail sales momentum. We\u2019re lapping a very difficult quarter from one of the greatest launches that we\u2019ve had, and an incredible product and Rushmore and certainly beating that. So, again, as I just mentioned, certainly the third quarter was an infection point. We feel great about the fact that we had flat share and that flat share, just to make sure everyone's clear, is that is one-tenth behind the highest share that we\u2019ve ever had as a company in any quarter. So we feel great about where we\u2019re at from a standpoint of market share. But, Greg as you pointed out, as we start to move forward, we will get a tailwind certainly from Road Glide, but you got to remember that we also added four other models of Rushmore and those Lows are going to open up a whole new audience to a lot of people that couldn\u2019t sit on a touring bike. We\u2019ll have the lowest seat height of any touring bike in the heavyweight category. So we\u2019ve got that.","And then, of course, Street availability. We still were hampered a fair amount in the third quarter in not having enough in the dealerships. We will rectify that as we move through the fourth quarter and again we will end the fourth quarter and be ready for spring selling season with a full array of Street products here in the United States as well as some additional international markets.","Other than that, the core fundamentals of the brand are all performing extremely well. Our outreach sales did fantastic in the second quarter, Sportster rebounding as we had expected, repurchase intent, repurchase cycle, new to brand, the industry is performing very well. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s in front of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","I guess I'm just curious about the Street models. I think originally, they were supposed to act as a drag on gross margin. When do you see those coming more in line maybe with corporate averages? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit more about Latin American performance? It seems like there was a pretty big disparity between last quarter and this quarter. I know you called out Mexico on this quarter's slides, but was there anything else that may have contributed to that? Thanks.","John Olin","When we look at the Street motorcycle, what we have said is that we would expect about half a point of dilutive impact to overall gross margin percent, certainly accretive to profits and that\u2019s just certainly had a lower price point and a lower profit per unit. And as we get those folks into the family, they will quickly trade out of Street into some of our bigger and more profitable motorcycles. But that thinking hasn\u2019t changed.","Given some of the start-up costs that we\u2019ve had, that half a point dilutive aspect is more about three-quarters of a point this year, but once we\u2019re past the start-up issues, we would expect Street to still be a little bit dilute as we continue to sell and grow that business. But again, as we look at the long-term health of the overall business and how quickly people will move from that to other parts of the product and the new folks that is bringing in, we couldn\u2019t feel better that we\u2019re doing great and certainly on strategy.","When we look at what the early performance is of Street, the vast majority of customers coming in are new to the brand as well as outreach customers. So again going back to the Fatten the Tail strategy, you\u2019ve got Rushmore on one side that\u2019s doing a fantastic job encouraging trade up and you\u2019ve got Street bringing in a very large percentage of new and outreach customers. So we\u2019re doing fine, but overall margins, no big change in margins with regards to Street.","The second question that you Jamie is Latin America performance, and yes we are very pleased to see that turn a bit from the second quarter. We were actually down on a year-over-year basis and that was driven by Brazil. We have seen improvement in Brazil from the second to third quarter, but Brazil is still down modestly in the quarter and the gains that you\u2019re seeing at 7% up is largely driven by very strong performance in Mexico. The business in Mexico has been performing well for quite a while, as was Brazil and Brazil economic situations changed a bit, consumer confidence has shifted a bit. So we\u2019re a little bit cautious on Brazil, but seeing improvement from the second to third quarter there.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. On the inventory front, obviously you\u2019ve spoken to, for a while, increasing inventories as a result of the higher SKU count. Now you\u2019re specifically talking about the Street, but I guess help me walk through how to think about the rest of your line up, there\u2019s a lot of new skews year-over-year that you\u2019ll finish this year with versus where you were last year. You had all the new incremental Rushmore bikes and then there were some mid-year introductions as well. Are those just going to displace other retail units at retail or should there potentially be some incremental inventory as a result of that? And I guess, sort of bigger picture, do you expect to finish this year at the right amount of inventory or do some of that carryover into 2015 where there might be some incremental inventory fill?","John Olin","We expect to finish exactly where we\u2019ve always intended to finish this year. And again, I can\u2019t stress enough that we are completely committed to keeping a very clean dealer channel and aggressively managing the supply in line with demand and that\u2019s what prompted our actions last quarter. And we will be back on track by the end of the year and made great progress in the third quarter.","So to answer your question, we do expect year-end retail inventory to be up moderately behind dealer fill in Street. The last majority of any increase will be due to Street. We would expect the rest of the line to be flat to slightly up in overall inventory. We\u2019ve always got models coming in and out of the lineup, James, and we feel that we got the right inventory levels and they can manage with what they have there. Street\u2019s being a little bit different being a new platform and those we need to get more slots into the dealership for. So, inventories will be, but primarily driven by Street.","Amy Giuffre","All right, thank you, everybody, and thanks for your time this morning.

Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information on this call.","Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin. Matt, let\u2019s get started.","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. You saw in our press release this morning that we will be sharing our accelerated strategy next Monday. We are eager to share the specific details with all of our stakeholders, because we\u2019re excited about the impacts of our plans to strengthen this great company and accelerate growth. Though we\u2019re not getting into the details today, I would like to talk about what we\u2019re driving toward and how we approach the development of the plan.","First, I want to thank the team for the great work they all did to put Harley-Davidson in a position to accelerate our strategy for growth. As employees, we all know we\u2019re are stewards of an incredible legacy, with unmatched passion and loyalty from everyone who associates with our brand. This universal passion is perhaps, our greatest strength. We\u2019re also keenly aware of the headwinds that Harley-Davidson faces today and into the future, and we are undeterred. We are driven by these challenges. We\u2019re fueled by the passion of our founders who set our true north back in 1903, as they were pioneers of a new kind of freedom back then, so we are today.","Our plan is Harley-Davidson through and through, and we\u2019ll redefine existing boundaries of our brand, reaching more customers through new types of products and channels and doing so in a way that reinforces all we stand for as a brand and as a company to secure the legacy of Harley-Davidson freedom for generations to come. As we set out to develop the strategy, we started with a realistic assessment of the risks, opportunities and capabilities needed to stabilize and strengthen our base business, reinvigorate the U.S. business, accelerate the pace of international growth and drive value for the long-term.","We leveraged our data-driven insights and leaned into our substantial competitive advantages. We\u2019ve been clear focused on all it will take to grow ridership by both inspiring new riders and keeping our current riders engaged. Last year, when we established our objectives to build more riders, our most important step was to put riding and the rider first in all of our thinking and in all of our actions. This rider-first focus is the backbone of our strategic planning and frankly, all of our work. We know global consumer needs and interests are shifting, and we knew we needed to shift our thinking to bold actions, to change our trajectory and better leverage our vast capabilities and competitive firepower, excellence in product development, manufacturing, brand and our great dealer network.","We know we must deliver more compelling new products more quickly for our current riders and to inspire a new generation to join motorcycling. Product innovation and speed-to-market is a capability that we firmly established, and we continue to drive. This is the core of what we do and it\u2019s the very essence of our objective to launch 100 new high-impact products by 2027. We must also reach more customers. Our brand appeal is universal but access is limited. We need to rapidly expand the reach of our brand and products to capture hearts and fuel the passion of freedom-seeking people the world over.","Our plan is intended to create broader access through an integrated multichannel customer experience for Harley-Davidson products that meets consumers where they are and how they want to engage, whether online or in store. And we know we must improve Harley-Davidson customer experience. Our dealer network is a clear advantage today, and will continue to be the hub of customer experience going forward. Customer expectations are incredibly dynamic, and we need to further strengthen our dealers to meet new customer demands and rapidly evolving retail expectations. We will enhance our performance driven approach to dealer network management, allowing the best-performing and most entrepreneurial retail partners to drive network innovation and success for themselves and Harley-Davidson, with exceptional customer experience at the core.","In addition, continued expansion and improvement of our international dealer network is key to providing better access to global growth opportunities. In sum, our strategy is designed to accelerate our efforts to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders by delivering new products, creating broader access and strengthening our dealers. We plan to drive revenue growth and expand operating margins, and we challenged ourselves to fund strategic opportunities, while keeping intact our current investment and return profile and capital allocation strategy. The entire team is energized, and we look forward to sharing our accelerated strategy in a few days.","Now back to the objective of this call and some of my perspectives on our second quarter. Overall, our performance was in line with our expectations and plans, and our efforts to strengthen our business remained on target through the second quarter. Great work continues on our manufacturing optimization, and we expect our expansion in New York, Pennsylvania and the transition from Kansas City to be complete in 2019. We are proud of our manufacturing legacy and our employees\u2019 commitment to safety, quality and global competitiveness.","And let\u2019s be clear, as we said in our 8-K, when tariffs were enacted by the EU in the second quarter, it put further pressure on our business, and we made the best decision given the circumstances. The best decision for our customers, our dealers and our business in this critical market. We will continue to make the best business decisions for Harley-Davidson and our stakeholders based on the facts and circumstances before us, and we will continue to build Harley-Davidson motorcycles for our U.S. riders in United States, as we have for our entire 115-year history.","Retail dynamics remain top of mind, as we continue to be vigilant in managing supply in line with demand to maintain premium value for riders and dealers. To support retail sales during the quarter, we invested in marketing and sales support, with targeted programs to encourage trial, purchase and to build new riders. Our efforts drove traffic into dealerships, increased access to the brand and drove global sales. In Q2, we experienced increased international retail sales, improved the rate of Riding Academy participants who purchased Harley-Davidson motorcycles and expanded access to our products in emerging markets through new dealerships and apparel and lifestyle boutiques in urban shopping areas.","Improved and enhanced marketing investments drove millions of engagements with the Harley-Davidson brand. Visits to our website alone were up 29% in the quarter. Here are some additional Q2 marketing highlights by the numbers. We drove nearly 37 million social media impressions from Motorcycle Monday, 10 million social media views of #FindYourFreedom intern content and 6 million Facebook views of Freedom Stories and Harley Asia. Millions of points of inspiration for existing, new and future riders. We are acting now, and for the future, to provide clear leadership, as the global motorcycle industry continues to serve up challenges.","Industry weakness in certain global markets is being met with additional marketing support and intensified focus. We are responding in real time in a dynamic world with smart agility, all while we intensify our focus on improving the strength and prospects of our business for the long-term through accelerating our strategic action. I am proud of the team, our employees, our dealers and suppliers, and I want to thank our loyal and passionate riders who we all worked tirelessly to serve. We are ready to welcome them to the birthplace of Harley-Davidson, as we celebrate our 115th anniversary here in Milwaukee over Labor Day weekend. If our 115th party in Prague earlier this month was any indication, it will be one hell of a good time.","And now, John will review the financial results for the second quarter. John?","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. Our second quarter financial results are in line with our plans. In the face of ongoing retail sales headwinds in the United States, we remain focused on reducing U.S. retail inventory, reducing costs and investing in our strategy to drive value for our riders, dealers and shareholders. The summary of our Q2 results is on Slide 8. In the second quarter, revenue was down modestly despite a significant decrease in shipments. We plan to lower shipments in the quarter to support reduced year-over-year retail inventories in United States.","As planned, motorcycle operating income was down as a result of lower shipments, a $12.4 million restructuring charge and increased operating expense. Financial services operating income was down 1.7%. Consolidated net income was down 6.4% due to lower operating income, partially offset by the benefit of a considerably lower tax rate. Earnings per share was $1.45 for the quarter. When excluding manufacturing optimization costs, EPS was $1.52. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term, despite near-term headwinds.","On Slide 9, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q2 were down 3.6% versus prior year. Sequentially, the year-over-year Q2 retail sales rate improved compared to the Q1 2018 sales rate, which was down 7.2%. We were pleased to see the year-over-year U.S. industry rate of decline improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2018. However, as we expected, U.S. retail sales in Q2 continued to be adversely impacted by very weak U.S. industry sales.","In international markets, we experienced retail sales growth behind strength in Europe and emerging markets. For the full year, we continue to expect retail sales to be down in United States, while international retail sales are expected to grow. During the quarter, we were encouraged by a strong revenue growth for motorcycle. International retail sales growth, our U.S. dealers inventory position and certainly by the actions we are taking to build ridership.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the U.S. on Slide 10. U.S. retail sales were down 6.4% in Q2, which is in line with our expectations. Retail sales started off very weak behind unseasonable weather in April. We experienced a good rebound in May and June, partially aided by increased promotional support intended to spark Spring sales momentum. The U.S. industry was down 6.3%. We believe the new motorcycle industry sales continued to be adversely impacted by soft used bike prices.","Sales of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles continued to outperform sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Also, Q2 used Harley-Davidson wholesale prices at auctions were in line with year-ago levels and pricing services such as NADA and Black Book continued to publish higher retail values year-over-year for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Additionally, used Harley-Davidson motorcycle prices in our dealerships increased for the fourth straight quarter. Stronger Harley-Davidson used bike prices reinforced our disciplined focus on driving premium value for our riders, dealers and the brand.","Moving on to new motorcycle market share. Harley-Davidson\u2019s share in the quarter remained a very healthy 48.4%, largely flat to last year\u2019s Q2 despite a highly competitive marketplace. We remain very competitive in the segments in which we compete. Harley-Davidson\u2019s market share in the Touring and Cruiser segments, which represents approximately 75% of the 601+cc market was up in both the quarter and year-to-date. We believe our discipline to reduce supply and improve model year mix in the U.S. retail channel delivered its intended results. U.S. inventory was down approximately 14,100 units compared to a year ago.","On Slide 11, international retail sales were up slightly in the second quarter, driven by growth in emerging markets, which were up 3.5%. We experienced significant growth in several emerging markets, including China, Brazil and Mexico, partially offset by declines in India. We were pleased to see growth -- our growth trajectory and emerging markets continued to accelerate for the second consecutive quarter.","In developed international markets, Q2 retail sales were largely flat to prior year, a result of 4.3% growth in Western Europe, offset by continued weakness in Japan and Australia. Europe sales were fueled by strong demand for our new Softail motorcycles. Retail sales in Japan and Australia continued to be weak in Q2 behind contracting industry sales and competitive new product introductions in segments outside of touring and cruising.","We continue to support our dealers in these markets with incentives and a strong focus on national test ride campaigns. Year-to-date market share in Europe was 10.4%, up 0.9 percentage points versus the prior year quarter.","Finally, we continue to expand our international dealer network and added 12 new dealers during the quarter. We remain confident and committed to the great potential that international markets offer Harley-Davidson. We continue to leverage our brand, products and distribution opportunities to drive sustainable growth in international markets.","On Slide 12, wholesale motorcycle shipments were down significantly in the quarter and were at the high-end of our shipment guidance. Mix in Q2 reflects strong global demand for our new Softail motorcycles.","On Slide 13, revenue for the motorcycles segment was down 3.3% in the second quarter, despite year-over-year motorcycle shipments being down 11.3%. Revenue during the quarter benefited from a $1,244 increase in the average motorcycle revenue per bike. This increase was driven by a richer product mix, higher year-over-year pricing and favorable currency exchange.","Both P&A and general merchandise revenue growth outperformed motorcycle retail sales growth during the quarter. We were pleased to see a very profitable mix of products again in the second quarter. We are working to grow our business and remain focused on our approach to optimize profitability and maximize brand value.","On Slide 14, gross margin in the second quarter was down as a result of lower shipments and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by strong mix and higher pricing. Mix favorability was driven by a shift to higher trim models within our product families. The financial impact of currency was flat during the second quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar benefited revenue by 1.5%. However, this benefit was largely offset by a loss, as we remeasured our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. Raw material costs were higher during the quarter behind increased deal and aluminum prices. Finally, manufacturing was unfavorable versus prior year, driven by lower absorption on lower production and shipments and higher depreciation.","On Slide 15, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q2 was 16.0%, down 4.1 percentage points compared to last year. Operating margin percent was adversely impacted by lower gross margin, higher SG&A spending, as we invested in higher levels of marketing and product development and a $12.4 million restructuring charge related to our manufacturing optimization. Profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus. It is our objective to further leverage our established capabilities to continue to drive profit, cash flow and tap top quartile ROIC into the future.","HDFS Q2 operating income, shown on Slide 16, decreased 1.7% compared to last year behind lower net interest income, offset by a favorable provision for loan losses. Net income \u2013 net interest income was down $6.3 million due to higher borrowing costs. The provision for retail loan losses was favorable by $5.9 million driven by a lower credit losses and a reduction in the reserve rate compared to rising reserve rate in Q2 2017.","HDFS\u2019s operational results are on Slide 17. Q2 originations were up 7.2% versus prior year despite lower new retail sales in the U.S. Market share was up 1.6 percentage points during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, there was $351 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $817.7 million of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities. During the quarter, HDFS issued medium-term notes, totaling $800 million.","On Slide 18, the 30 day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet at the end of June was 3.09% or 16 basis points lower than Q2 2017. The annualized retail credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.56% or 15 basis points lower than 2017. We were encouraged to see a year-over-year decline in credit losses for another quarter, after having experienced an extended period of increases, as credit losses normalized. HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company.","The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 19. Year-to-date operating cash flow was up $108.8 million or 17.3% from last year, driven by lower wholesale financing. Our effective tax rate was 24.1% year-to-date, which was considerably lower than last year, largely due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act. And finally, regarding liquidity the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","We believe the charts on Slide 20 demonstrate that we benchmarked very well against various peer groups in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders for the period of 2015 to 2017. One of the five objectives guiding our business strategies and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by Motor Company ROIC and the top quartile of the S&P 500 and by a best-in-class return on equity at HDFS. Harley-Davidson is a leader in ROIC At The Motor Company and ROE at HDFS and is the clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders.","Slide 21 illustrates our recent history of returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter of 2018, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and repurchased $38.2 million of our stock. Share repurchases during Q2 were limited, as we halted trading of our stock for company insiders and company share repurchases due to our work on the accelerated growth strategy.","We intend to resume our share repurchase program, after we provide more information on our plans. Driving superior value for all our stakeholders is our top priority. We will continue to look for opportunities to grow value through investments that maximize the performance and long-term potential of the company and the brand. We have a robust and disciplined process for our investment decisions. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and share repurchases.","On Slide 22 is a summary of expectations and year-to-date actual results for our multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative. We continued to expect our efforts to result in a reduction in operating income of $170 million to $200 million through 2019, of which, roughly 30% will be non-cash write-downs of existing assets. We also plan to invest approximately $75 million in capital and expect annual ongoing cash savings of between $65 million to $75 million after 2020.","During the second quarter, we incurred $12.4 million of restructuring expense, driven primarily by accelerated depreciation. We also incurred $2.4 million in temporary inefficiencies related to our manufacturing optimization. We believe these investments have very attractive returns, when completed we expect this initiative will simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus in our operational investments and improve gross margin by approximately 1.25 percentage points.","A summary of our expectations for 2018 is on Slide 23. We are confirming our 2018 guidance with the exception of operating margin in HDFS operating income. Previously, we expected operating margin as a percent of revenue for the motorcycles segment to be approximately 9.5% to 10.5% for the full year of 2018, which was down approximately 2 to 3 percentage points compared to 2017, primarily driven by our planned manufacturing optimization expenditures of $120 million to $140 million in 2018.","As a result of the recently enacted tariffs, we expect to incur approximately $45 million to $55 million of increased costs. This includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum and approximately $30 million to $35 million for EU tariffs. We expect to absorb a significant portion of these incremental costs through disciplined business management.","However, given the magnitude of these unplanned cost, we are adjusting our full year 2018 operating margin guidance. We now expect operating margin as a percent of revenue for the motorcycles segment to be approximately 9% to 10% for the full year 2018. Behind HDFS\u2019s strong first-half results, we now expect Financial Services segment operating income will be flat to up slightly in 2018.","In the third quarter, we expect to ship approximately 45,500 to 50,500 motorcycles, up 9% to 21%, first half shipments were down 10.5%. Consequently, to achieve our full year shipment guidance of down 2% to 4%, we expect back half shipments to be up roughly 6% to 12%. We believe the shipment gains will result in appropriate U.S. retail inventory through the selling season, including an improved level of carryover inventory at model year changeover.","Timing of shipments is expected to result in flat year-end retail inventory in the U.S. and it supports our disciplined supply strategy, which we believe is delivering its intended results. Finally, we expect the shipment cadence will also impact the timing of our operating margin in the remaining quarters of 2018. Finally, during Q3, we expect to incur approximately $25 million in manufacturing optimization costs, including $18 million in restructuring expense and $7 million in temporary inefficiencies.","To wrap up, we will continue to be disciplined in our management of motorcycle supply, drive premium value for our riders, dealers and our brand, amplify our costs management efforts and relentlessly focus on our long-term objectives. We look forward to announcing our accelerated strategy to build the next-generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally on Monday. We will continue to focus our investments, deliver strong returns to our shareholders and drive growth for our company for the long-term.","Thank you. And now let\u2019s take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Thank you. So my first question is, I was just wondering, John, if you could just call out for us the impact of EagleRider and the rental sales on the domestic retail registration in the quarter? Or to word it another way: How many EagleRider rental units were sold in the quarter? And just remind me, last year, the benefit was in the third quarter, and maybe it\u2019s the second quarter this year. And then I have a follow-up.","John Olin","All right. To remind everyone, EagleRider is a partnership for rentals of our motorcycles that we established about a year ago, second quarter. And over this period of time, we\u2019ve been signing up dealers, and things are going as expected, and we\u2019re very pleased with that relationship. When we look at the first half results, Felicia, with EagleRider, this year versus our authorized rentals last year, overall sales of -- I\u2019m sorry, shipments and retail sales are about flat with each other. So the first quarter was neck and neck as to where we were.","When we look at by quarter, in the first quarter this year, we shipped in a little bit more and, in the second quarter, a little bit less, but nothing of large numbers. Last year -- you had mentioned what happened last year. Last year, we got the partnership started in the second quarter, and we had a higher level of shipments in the third quarter last year. And remember that overall EagleRider only represents about 2% of our annual sales.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, so it doesn\u2019t seem like it really affected the results in the quarter.","John Olin","No, it did not, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then I think in the past, maybe if you said it, I might have missed it, but in the past, you had talked about growth in the portfolio including new plus used bikes. So I was wondering if you haven\u2019t mentioned that. Or can you -- if I missed it, can you just quantify that?","John Olin","Yes, when we look at, what we call, total demand, which is the combination of new sales and used sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, remember, that information is lagged by a month, and through May, we\u2019re seeing that used sales was about flat, you see, but our new sales were down during that period of time. And so net total demand is down a little bit for the -- through the first five months of this year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Do you expect that to improve for the rest of the year?","John Olin","I don\u2019t know. I think that when you add in the month of June, it will improve. As far as the rest of the year, we\u2019ll have to see.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, if you add in June, do you think it will be up or just -- or flat?","John Olin","We don\u2019t provide that type of forward-looking, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning. First off, John, you said that May and June rebounded. What does that mean? Does that mean May and June grew or were just down less?","John Olin","In aggregate, they were down less, Gerrick. When we look at April, April was down in the mid-teens, May was largely flat, and June was down a little bit.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, great. And then on your marketing metrics. They look impressive, but it seems so far, they\u2019ve failed to drive growth in sales. So is there a disconnect? And why is that perhaps, not resonating?","John Olin","No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a disconnect at all. We\u2019re doing a lot on the marketing side to bring in the next generation of riders, and what we are facing, Gerrick, is very strong headwinds in the overall industry. We\u2019ve got a strong undertow and despite the marketing efforts and great product that we\u2019re bringing to the market, we are working through a very difficult industry conditions.","Gerrick Johnson","All right, thank you. I have a bunch more. I\u2019ll get back in queue and I'll let others to ask, thanks.","John Olin","Thank you, Gerrick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. I guess, I was intrigued by a comment in the slides about the Thailand facility and the potential of a lower pricing to some international markets. Can you talk about when Thailand\u2019s up and running and, kind of, what percent of your international markets might be seeing lower retail pricing as a result of that?","John Olin","Thanks, Sharon. When we look at our Thailand facility, which will come online in -- early in the fourth quarter, the purpose of the facility, like we have in Brazil and India, is to be able to provide a lower price to our consumers, and -- one that is not burdened with excessive tariffs. And so when we start up to produce out of Thailand, we\u2019ll be able to lower our price to the dealers and our dealers to -- on to our customers, and we feel that the affordability of our products will increase. That\u2019s happening largely, Sharon, in our ASEAN markets, which, at this time, are not a huge part of our volume but certainly, a significant portion of our future growth opportunity.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. And have you confirmed that Thailand\u2019s where you\u2019re going to manufacture the EU bikes?","John Olin","No, we haven\u2019t. We are looking at all of our options there. We\u2019ve got three international facilities, and we\u2019re looking at the best opportunity to supply the EU out of those facilities.","Sharon Zackfia","So when should we expect a decision on that?","John Olin","When we have it, and it is appropriate time, we\u2019ll provide it to all our stakeholders.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Matt, I know you\u2019ve invested in Big Data to understand consumer trends in the U.S. I\u2019m wondering whether you\u2019re making similar investments in the European and maybe other international markets and how your strategy might be influenced by similar Big Data investments.","Matt Levatich","Yes, thanks, Craig. And clearly, the U.S. being the most significant market for us, that\u2019s where our efforts were first, and we have and continue to build a knowledge base of data assets that are helping us understand participation and migration trends. Collectively, we call that the rider migration knowledge base, and we\u2019re leveraging that in focusing our actions in the near-term and for the long-term. As you point out -- and we also suspect that developed markets globally, probably have some of the same trends and tendencies, so we\u2019re investing now to build that knowledge market by market. It becomes more challenging to do so, given different country laws and so forth and availability of data. But obviously, data is key to smart decisions, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re placing our investment as well as we roll forward.","Craig Kennison","And then as a follow-up on your European market, I know you\u2019ve announced plans to absorb that tariff impact, something like $2,200 per bike. Curious how dealers have reacted to that decision and how you would characterize the attitude towards Harley-Davidson more broadly in Europe.","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Craig, the response, I initially got directly from several dealers in Europe was it was one of the proudest days of their long association with the brand, for the company to see and protect their investment and the stability and ongoing growth of their market. And so that continued as well for the folks at the company that were in Prague. We had 110,000 people from over 70 countries in Prague, and the dealers that were there, many of them were there, they also reiterated time and time again their appreciation for the solidarity that the company has with them as our business partner. And that was a very key part of our decision when the tariffs went into effect, to protect the marketplace and our customer value equation as well as our dealer business model, which is so key to our growth as we roll forward.","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So the second quarter shipments were obviously at the high end of your guide. Maybe talk a little bit about Europe. I would think that there was probably some buy ahead, at both the real -- retail and the dealer level, just given that the tariffs were, I think, widely anticipated at the beginning of 3Q. Maybe talk a little about that. How that maybe impacted your numbers? And how we should think about that for 3Q? And then I have a follow-up.","John Olin","Hi James, this is John. We did not see any discernible shift in the patterns -- sales patterns in Europe throughout the tariff period. Matter of fact, our sales in Europe were not as strong as they were in the first quarter, when there was no talk of the tariffs. So we don\u2019t see it. It could have happened a bit, but nothing that we could discern.","James Hardiman","But you didn\u2019t try to get any of those bikes out on the water to maybe\u2026","John Olin","I\u2019m sorry, I misunderstood. Yes, absolutely. As we learned about the potential for increased tariffs in the region, we did our best to move product into Europe. And as you can see, our overall company inventory is up quite a bit. A piece of that is company-owned inventory.","James Hardiman","Got it. And then, maybe on the margin front, you\u2019re lowering your operating margin by about 50 basis -- well, exactly 50 basis points, I should say, at the high end and the low end. Maybe a little bit of a bridge. I mean, the $30 million to $45 million from tariffs, it seems like it would actually be more than that 50 basis points. And then the $15 million to $20 million you mentioned for steel and aluminum, I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s the same $15 million to $20 million that you talked about three months ago, or if that\u2019s incremental. Maybe a little bit more clarification on the puts and the takes there.","John Olin","Great, good question, James. So I want to make this as clear as possible. When the tariffs first happened, we believed that there would be an impact to raw material costs of $15 million to $20 million, and we have not changed that. The markets have done what they\u2019ve done. They haven\u2019t changed much, and -- nor has our perspective of the cost of incremental steel and aluminum costs. That is $15 million to $20 million. With regards to the tariffs, and that is the tariffs in European Union going from 6% to 31%, we believe that will be $30 million to $35 million.","In our 8-K, we had a broader range for just that piece of it. And the reason for that was that, your previous question with regards to inventory, and we were looking to see what the inventory situation would be when the tariffs got enacted. And with that, we\u2019ve got a much finer number, and that is $30 million to $35 million. So in aggregate, we believe that the cost of tariffs this year will be $45 million to $50 million. And you\u2019re absolutely right, when we look at our operating margin, we\u2019ve come down 50 basis points, which does not -- which only represents about half that amount.","We are doing everything we can as a company to absorb on the costs that we can, and as we look forward, we can\u2019t eat the whole $45 million to $50 million or can\u2019t cover it in other parts of our business. And for that, we are bringing down our guidance by the 50 basis points.","James Hardiman","Perfect, really helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So given your commentary on tariffs earlier in this call and the fact that Thailand is likely to open at the end of the year, and your decision to reallocate production is probably coming before that time frame, is it right to think that all of the exposure to tariffs will be off of the table by year-end? And then that motorcycle operating margins, sort of, resume whatever a normalized rate is?","John Olin","No, that is not safe to assume at all. The annual ongoing impact of the margins is $90 million to $100 million. And it is our aim to mitigate those over time, but this is going to take some amount of work, Jaime, to get this done. We\u2019ve never contemplated moving our European volume out of the United States. Consequently, we are analyzing the capacity options that we have, manufacturing costs, supply chain logistics in an effort to optimize it and to reduce and mitigate those tariffs. This will go into 2019. And again, we are working on the overall plans, and when we have them, we\u2019ll provide more information. But you should not expect that those costs will be mitigated fully in 2019. You can expect that some portion of them will be mitigated but not the full amount.","Jaime Katz","That\u2019s really helpful. And then I saw that used bike prices were up again in the commentary. This is the fourth straight quarter. Can you talk about the spread between used and new? And how maybe you think that\u2019s impacted demand? Thank you.","John Olin","Well, overall, when we look at -- so we\u2019re very pleased that over the last several quarters, four quarters, that we\u2019ve seen in our dealerships in the broader market, we have seen used bike prices rise, but they have a long way to go. When we look at previous of those four quarters, used bike prices had fallen for 13 straight quarters. And so we still have price value -- or price dislocation in used to new, but it is getting better as we see used bike prices rise. We\u2019re going to continue to be very diligent in our supply of motorcycles, which is the only lever that we have to pull, but we\u2019re pleased to see those prices rise.","Jaime Katz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joseph Spak","Thanks, good morning. John, I just want to make sure I understand because it sounds like you\u2019re saying the impact from the tariff this year was -- you put a finer point on the annualized number that $90 million to $100 million didn\u2019t change. So is that because you were able to get some more bikes out this quarter, but -- so there\u2019s a -- as we think about the first half of 2019, we should expect sort of a giveback of that?","John Olin","No, no. You should expect an annualized impact of $90 million to $100 million. That number didn\u2019t change because the tariffs are very easy to understand, right, 60% to 31%. What was tough for us was just this year, and that was the inventory position that we would have when the tariffs were put in place. And so we\u2019ve got a fine number on that. So there is no change. The way to think about it is: If there is no mitigation of tariffs by the company into 2019, you would expect $90 million to $100 million.","We are making every effort to mitigate the costs of those tariffs. That $90 million to $100 million represents the vast majority of profits in that market. But we don\u2019t have that plan yet. And when we do have that plan, we\u2019ll take that and fine tune that $90 million to $100 million for 2019, and that will come down. And again, when we have the plan, we\u2019ll provide it to you.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And then, I know you\u2019ve historically, shied away from giving absolute daily inventory or even day sales metrics. And I don\u2019t really expect you to start now, but given the magnitude of the de-stocking and also the soft retail environment, I was wondering if you could help us just on a relative basis, how you stand now versus historically?","John Olin","It\u2019s down a lot. It\u2019s -- we took 14,100 units out, and that is a significant percentage, well into the double-digit percents. On top of that, a year ago, we took out 7,100 units. So in aggregate, coming out of the second quarter, we\u2019re down about 21,000 units. And we have significantly tightened things up, and that will help us when we get to the model year changeover. And we\u2019re seeing the intended results of that, and that is putting upward pressure on those used bike prices.","Joseph Spak","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Beckel","Thanks for the question. On the topic of mitigating factors or potential mitigating factors, there\u2019s been some, I guess, scuttlebutt on Twitter about certain mediating factors or potential olive branches to certain industries granting them exceptions. Have you been able to work with the U.S. government at all to try to figure out a way to keep production in the U.S. without also suffering the tariff charge?","John Olin","We are working with the administration. We are working with all governments we can to do the best we can to get these tariffs removed, and that\u2019s all I can say about it. We are very engaged and got a dialogue and a constant dialogue going on with the respective parties that we need to.","David Beckel","Great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, your expectation of flat inventory in the U.S. at the end of the year in combination with your overall goal of maintaining supply discipline. Does that more or less imply you expect sales to be either flat or maybe slightly up in 2019?","John Olin","No, that doesn\u2019t imply anything. We\u2019ll provide 2019 guidance in January of next year. The smallest quarter that we have in inventory is the fourth quarter, and we also need that as a jump-off spot for production to get over the seasonal aspect of our business. So we will bring inventories back to year-ago levels at the end of the year, and that will provide us the opportunity to supply the next year selling season, but it shouldn\u2019t be taken as anything except that inventories will end up flat in the United States on a year-over-year basis.","David Beckel","Great, thank you so much.","Amy Giuffre","David, are you still on?","David Beckel","Yes.","Amy Giuffre","Were you asking about U.S. sales for 2018, or assumptions for that?","David Beckel","No, just heading into 2019.","Amy Giuffre","Into 2019. Okay, thank you, just wanted to be sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you and good morning. Wanted to ask the same question regarding timing of shipments or anything that you\u2019re seeing in Canada. Same question was asked relative to the EU. And then, John, also, any update, given we\u2019ve had some significant moves in the dollar, and maybe given the back of late here the last few days, but \u2013 on FX impact for the year.","John Olin","All right, I\u2019m going to start with the second on first, and that\u2019s with regards to currency. It was an \u2013 somewhat of an unusual period or quarter for currency. On a year-over-year basis, when you look at our basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar was weaker by 4% versus a year ago. And therefore, we had a favorable revenue impact of about $23 million, and that represents about 1.5% of overall revenue, a pickup of revenue because of currency. However, when you look at our gross margin walk, you\u2019ll see that currency was largely flat.","So what that means is that $23 million was absorbed and what \u2013 why it was absorbed is largely on remeasurement losses. And so while on a year-over-year basis, our currency is \u2013 the U.S. dollar is weaker, and that is favorable to us, during the quarter, we saw a substantial increase or strengthening of the U.S. dollar of about 5 percentage points. With that, we remark our balance sheet assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter, and therefore, there was a loss that offset that.","So consequently, very little financial benefit, certainly none at gross margin. The second question, Tim, I\u2019m not completely clear what you mean shipments of \u2013 or timing of shipments into Canada. If you\u2019re referring to tariffs, there has been \u2013 we have not been included in any talk of tariffs in Canada, Mexico or India. And therefore, we have not changed our shipment patterns as per usual into Canada or any of those other markets.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. And just the Canadian, also from this perspective of maybe a little bit of lag and, even more so, from a weather perspective, any adjustments you had to make there from shipment timing?","John Olin","No.","Tim Conder","Okay. Last question, dealer \u2013 international dealer outlook, in the overall multi-year perspective, you gave that the 12 dealers added during the quarter. In total, what do you \u2013 just an update, what do you expect to add in this year and then just any change on that long-term perspective?","John Olin","No change on our long-term perspective or excitement for our international markets. So we talk about our strategies next week, we\u2019ll talk certainly more about international. We don\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t provided the full year number of dealer openings through [indiscernible] I wouldn\u2019t expect much of a change from what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years in that respect.","Tim Conder","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas","Thanks. First one is just to kind of clarify on that European pre-buy issue. John, you mentioned that there was, that you did make an effort to get some bikes on the water. I\u2019m just curious if you could quantify was that revenue recognized in 2Q, or is this a spillover into 3Q. And maybe, the amount there.","John Olin","No, there is no change in revenue recognition. It was just the way that the authorities measure whether the product is subject to tariff or not. Has nothing to do with sales. We did not sell them into the dealer network.","Adam Jonas","So those bikes are not \u2013 so those bikes were not sold yet, or they \u2013 or were they sold?","John Olin","No, they were not sold on to dealers.","Adam Jonas","But they will not be subject to the tariff, is what you\u2019re saying?","John Olin","Correct. We took them \u2013 yes.","Adam Jonas","So you will get a bump in 3Q?","John Olin","I don\u2019t know what you mean by a bump. We have higher inventories on our balance sheet for increased amount of finished goods inventory. We do not believe that retail sales were dramatically affected by the tariffs. We do not believe that our shipments were not affected. Where we recognize revenue is when it leaves the \u2013 arrives in our dealerships in Europe.","Adam Jonas","Understood. I understand because you are able to slip in the bikes ahead of the tariff whether they\u2019re \u2013 whether that could lead to an unusual level of sales in 3Q that then creates a bit of a hangover later in the quarter into 4Q.","John Olin","No, Joe, we are keeping prices flat. We are not pricing for the tariffs. So what that does is it reduce our costs, and that\u2019s why in the 4-K, we had a bigger range than we expected to be. So that\u2019s a savings to the company.","Adam Jonas","Okay, understood. And just as a follow-up, on a longer term, your efforts to build new riders is, obviously, recognizing and is meant to face up to some pretty powerful demographic shifts. It seems like it\u2019s more secular rather than cyclical given the health of the economy. So I\u2019m just wondering if you \u2013 I can\u2019t think of many examples in business where a company through marketing efforts really successfully execute a strategy of, kind of, creating its own demand, I \u2013 without front running too much what you\u2019re doing next \u2013 and what you\u2019re going to announce in a few day \u2013 next week, just, can you give us some examples of what you\u2019re looking at from \u2013 that you might have studied that helped your team execute the strategy? Thanks.","Matt Levatich","Hi, Adam, this is Matt. I just would encourage you to tune in next Monday. We\u2019re going to talk about the issues that we\u2019ve identified as we laid out our 10-year objectives last year about the need to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders across the globe, and how we\u2019re going to accelerate those efforts, how we\u2019re going to leverage, as I mentioned in my remarks, our products, access and stronger dealers do that. But yes, this is what we\u2019re after in our strategy, and we\u2019re accelerating our efforts, and we\u2019re excited to share that next week.","Adam Jonas","All right. Look forward at that, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joe Altobello","Thanks, hey guys, good morning. So two quick questions for you. I guess, first, was curious about the success you guys have had with Freedom Promise. In a most recent dealer survey, a few dealers mentioned it fairly positively. So thoughts on that and maybe extending that beyond August 31. And then secondly, a balance sheet question. Inventories, I guess, year-over-year up almost $100 million. So help us understand what\u2019s driving that. Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks Joe, We\u2019re very excited \u2013 first of all, we\u2019re very excited about the Freedom Promise. At this point, we are not looking to extend it. But it has met our expectations and is a great bridge for a new person coming in to Harley-Davidson and buying the first motorcycle and their ability to trade in on their next motorcycle at the same price that they bought in at. But again, I\u2019m very pleased with that.","Secondly, inventories are up on our balance They\u2019re up $93 million or 25%, which is a lot. There are three areas of increase. We\u2019ve talked about one of them, is finished goods-made motorcycles. That has increased, and that\u2019s just an issue of timing. We talked about one of the reasons for that timing, and that is certainly, putting more bikes into Europe.","The second piece of it is raw materials. And matter of fact, raw materials is about half of it. And with the activity that we have going on in our plants, largely, we are reloading our Kansas City plant manufacturing into our York plant. We are holding a lot of duplicate inventories as we start the \u2013 start up production in the third quarter here in York for our Softail motorcycles.","And then secondly, as we have talked about, we have a plant in Thailand coming on. We\u2019re starting to bring raw materials into that plant as that production will start up later in the quarter, and ultimately, start shipping in early fourth quarter. The third piece of it is our related products. Related products is up for two reasons. Number one is increased availability, largely through general merchandise also please to see in the quarter that general merchandise was up almost 9%, but we did increase overall availability of general merchandise with our dealers.","Second piece of it is parts and accessories, which is up as well. And as you know, last year, we came up with a new Softail, which had three other models to go away: V-Rod, Dyna and our old Softail. And with that, we need to do what\u2019s called life-of-parts buys because those parts we need to continue to service well into the future. So that is also pushing up inventory. So those three, in aggregate, total up to the $93 million. We would start to \u2013 expect to see that to come down somewhat by year-end.","Joe Altobello","Great. Thanks, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. You mentioned that the European dealers responded positively on your decision to shift manufacturing. Have you got any feedback from your U.S. dealers or U.S. consumers on that move as well?","Matt Levatich","Yes, I think that the \u2013 I think mostly the U.S. dealers understand the nature of the decision to protect the business model within Europe and can see that if somehow the shoe was on the other foot, that we would do the right thing to take care of them. So first and foremost, the dealers have a great global connection to one another. We assemble them annually at our annual dealer meeting. They\u2019re in the same business. We approach the business in the same way wherever we do business in the world. And so, as they see through the challenge with the tariff situation, they see us doing the right thing for our customers, our dealers and our business, and they would appreciate us doing that for them if somehow, again, the situation was affecting them.","Greg Badishkanian","And then U.S. consumers [indiscernible]","Matt Levatich","Yes, we have done actually quite a lot of consumer research and not just with sales as we closed out the quarter but just direct consumer research on the impact of the matter, and we see no discernible shift in the sales patterns and no discernible favorability to the brand. So we\u2019ll continue to make sure we monitor it, and we\u2019ll do the right things to emphasize what Harley-Davidson stands for and why and correct errors and interpretation that seem to pop up from time to time. But we are on it and paying very close attention to it.","Greg Badishkanian","I guess, just one final. $1500 rebate introduced in May. How did that resonate with consumers?","John Olin","Remember, we talked about the way the quarter unfolded, and in April, we were down quite significantly. We did two things, Greg, at that time. One, in the beginning of April, we came out with a finance offer. I think it was 1.99% for a short period of time, two weeks. And the other piece of it was we offered a trading incentive. That was a private offer mailed to \u2013 through our precision marketing team to customers that we thought maybe ready for the purchase of a new motorcycle. And that we offered in May and in June. And, I think, between those two, it really helped pull us out of the poor sales that we had in April, and we finished the quarter in line with our expectations. So overall, we feel very good about the activity during the quarter and ending up on track for the full quarter.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Rolle with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning, it\u2019s David MacGregor here. I guess, John, did I hear you say that used bike dealer inventories are up? And, I guess, my question is whether dealers are committing more of their limited working capital and their willingness to finance the used inventory and therefore, putting a financial squeeze on their ability to support new bike inventory.","John Olin","David, you did not hear me say that used bike inventories were up, or if I did, I did not intend to say that. So when we look at \u2013 overall, new bike inventory was down. I will tell you that used bike inventories in our dealer network were up slightly during the quarter. But when we look over time, the last 14 quarters actually, used bike inventories in our dealer network have been down 10 of the last 14 quarters, but they were up a little bit in the second quarter. Overall, it\u2019s in line with what we would expect.","David MacGregor","And just as a follow-on to that. Your originations were up 7.2% versus the second quarter of last year. Can you break out new originations versus used originations?","John Olin","We don\u2019t typically break those out but actually, both were up. Used were up well into the double digits and even in the U.S., where sales were down, were up. And again, we had a very powerful mix of products, and that helped drive the value of those originations up in the United States. And we haven\u2019t talked much about that during the call, but you talk about the resilience of this company and the ability to offset the tough headwinds that we\u2019ve got in the United States. When over 75% to 80% of your revenue is made up of motorcycle shipments, and they\u2019re down over 11%, and revenue ends up only down 3.3%, it\u2019s pretty powerful, and we\u2019re very pleased with the mix shift.","But that\u2019s also aiding in those origination numbers that you\u2019re seeing in HDFS. And by the way, we haven\u2019t talked about HDFS. They had a fantastic quarter, they\u2019ve had a fantastic first half. We feel great about the portfolio. Credit losses are down for two quarters in a row, and originations are up. So things are going very well at HDFS.","David MacGregor","Good luck.","John Olin","Thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Amy Giuffre.","Amy Giuffre","Thanks, Heidi and thanks everyone.

Harley Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning our CFO, John Olin and President and CEO, Matt Levatich will be hosting the call. Let\u2019s get started, John.","John Olin","Thanks Amy, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll provide additional insight around our first quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. The summary of our first quarter financial results starts on Slide 4.","Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter performance. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. During the quarter, revenue was $1.75 billion, net income was $250.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.36. Operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 3.8% from last year\u2019s first quarter. Segment revenue was up 4.4% in the quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. As anticipated, gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange in addition to higher year-over-year start-up costs. SG&A was also up in the quarter as we significantly increased our investments in demand driving marketing and product development. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q1 was 21.1%. At HDFS, operating income was down 12.8% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization.","Now let\u2019s take a look at retail sales on Slide 5. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley Davidson motorcycles in the first quarter were up 1.4% versus prior year, an improvement from being down 0.6% in Q4 2015. Retail sales were up in our international regions and down slightly in the U.S. During the quarter, we made progress against our long-term growth objectives. We are driving demand in an environment of intense global competition. We believe Q1 retail sales benefited from our demand driving marketing investments and a strong reception to our new 2016 model year motorcycles.","Starting in the first quarter and throughout 2016, we plan to invest an incremental $70 million to drive demand. We expect our 2016 year-over-year investment in customer-facing marketing to be up 65% and product development investment to be up 35%. Our new 2016 model year motorcycles continued to sell well during the quarter. [Indiscernible] sales were strong driven by our two new Softail S models and our two refreshed sportsters. Touring sales also benefited from the new Road Glide Ultra.","While retail sales were up on a worldwide basis, we continue to experience headwinds from intense competitive environment and challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world. We are confident in our strong brand and our ability to grow in this highly competitive environment without engaging in brand-damaging discounting.","Let\u2019s take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 6. In the first quarter, we saw a slight decline in retail sales of 0.5%. As we anticipated, retail sales improved from recent trends despite the increasingly intense competitive discounting and declines in oil-dependent areas. During the quarter, we significantly increased our marketing investment focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. Retail market share for the first quarter continued to stabilize, down slightly compared to the same period last year. The industry continued to grow up 0.8% in the first quarter on top of the 9.0% increase in Q1 of last year. Finally as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 4,900 motorcycles at the end of the quarter compared to 2015, largely due to the initial dealer fill of our new 2016 models. We continue to be diligent in our efforts to manage supply in line with demand, and we\u2019re comfortable with the dealer inventory at the end of the quarter.","On Slide 7, you\u2019ll see retail sales in our international markets were up 4.5% in the first quarter, driven by sales increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Canada, partially offset by weakness in Brazil. In fact, excluding Brazil, international markets were up a strong 8.9%. EMEA region retail sales were up 8.8% in Q1, reflecting the significant increase in demand driving investments in that market. All major markets across EMEA were up in the quarter, with strong gains in France, Switzerland, Italy, and emerging markets in the region. First quarter market share in Europe was 10.3%, up 0.5 percentage points versus prior year, which is an improvement in recent market share trends. Market share growth was driven by increased investment and a great reception to our new motorcycles.","Asia-Pacific retail sales were up 6.6% in the first quarter, our best-ever first quarter. This growth was accomplished despite the adverse impact of temporarily exiting retail sales in Indonesia as we replace the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience in that market. Latin America retail sales were down 26.5% in the quarter as a result of declines in Brazil, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Brazil\u2019s retail sales continued to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices approximately 20%. While profitability per motorcycle improved, we expect retail sales to be down for the year. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 16.3% in the first quarter. We believe the market continued to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model.","In support of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added five new international dealerships in the first quarter.","On Slide 8, you\u2019ll see wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 4.3% compared to last year, at the high end of our expected range for the quarter. During the quarter, we shipped a higher percent of cruiser motorcycles compared to last year, given our product investments in model year 2016 motorcycles launched last August, as well as the Low Rider S and CVO Pro Street Breakout which started shipping toward the end of the first quarter.","We exited 2015 with increased motorcycle inventory on our balance sheet. This increase was aimed at supplying more motorcycles earlier in the year than typical in order to support our 2016 marketing plan and investments. While Q1 company inventory was down from year-end, it was still up versus prior year to support the selling season and our increased investments in marketing. Throughout the second quarter, we expect elevated year-over-year inventory as we anticipate lost production in the third quarter associated with the implementation of our ERP system at our Kansas City plant.","On Slide 9, you will see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was up in the first quarter behind a 4.3% increase in motorcycle shipments. Q1 revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange, which reduced revenue growth by nearly a percentage point. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was up slightly for the quarter behind higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. During the quarter, P&A revenue was flat and general merchandise revenue was up 6.3% behind stronger sales of riding gear. Both P&A and general merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange during the quarter.","On Slide 10, you\u2019ll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 1.7 percentage points versus last year. Gross margin was supported by favorable volume, price and raw materials offset by unfavorable mix, foreign currency exchange and manufacturing costs. During the quarter, overall mix was a headwind of $14.8 million driven by a shift in both motorcycles and related product mix. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable behind the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. On a combined basis, the euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollars devalued an average of 4% compared to the prior year quarter. In the first quarter, gross margin was adversely impacted by $10.6 million as a result of lower revenue.","Manufacturing was unfavorable by $15.6 million driven by higher year-over-year start-up costs, including the cost related to the implementation of our ERP system at our Kansas City plant, which we expect to be complete by the end of Q3. In addition, we experienced lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower production in Q1 versus the same period last year.","On Slide 11, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was a very strong 21.1%, but down 1.8 percentage points compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $332.5 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher SG&A. While SG&A spending was lower than we expected due to a shift in timing of spending from Q1 to Q2, SG&A was up $13.0 million year-over-year driven by our increased investment in marketing and product development and costs associated with managing our Canadian operations, which we acquired in August of 2015. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible, and more profitable.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our financial services segment on Slide 12. During the quarter, HDFS\u2019 operating profit decreased $8.3 million or 12.8% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were: first, net interest income was up over prior year by $1.6 million, driven by higher receivables partially offset by higher interest costs and lower yields on receivables due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity; and second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was increased over prior year by $12.9 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance for retail credit losses.","HDFS\u2019 operations are summarized on Slide 13. During the first quarter, HDFS\u2019 retail motorcycle loan originations increased 8.9% compared to the same period last year. In the first quarter, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% sub-prime. As a predominant industry lender to sub-prime customers, these originations represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. For the quarter, HDFS continued to have a strong U.S. retail market share of new Harley Davidson motorcycles at 56.8%, up 3.5 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, we had $344.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. This quarter, HDFS issued $1.2 billion in medium term notes and paid $140 million dividend to Harley Davidson Inc.","On Slide 14, you\u2019ll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter was 2.88% or 24 basis points higher than Q1 2015. The delinquency rate was up particularly in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquency remained at low levels. Annual retail credit losses increased by 42 basis points to [indiscernible] compared to 2015. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing sub-prime performance, and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company.","The remaining Harley Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 15. The company generated operating cash of $41.1 million during the quarter, down from last year driven by increased wholesale lending and higher working capital. Also, the tax rate was 34.5%, which is in line with last year\u2019s rate. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 16, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. During the first quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.31 to $0.35 per share, up 12.9%. In addition, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our stock for $144.6 million. Looking forward, we expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases.","On Slide 17, you\u2019ll see our overall expectations for 2016. In 2016, we continue to expect to ship 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles, an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect second quarter shipments to be approximately down 3% to up 3% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. U.S. dealer retail inventory is expected to be up at year-end 2016 to support incremental models and increase marketing investment. For the full year 2016, we expect operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be between 16% and 17%. We believe 2016\u2019s gross margin as a percent of revenue will be down year-over-year driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable mix, and higher year-over-year start-up costs associated with the implementation of our ERP system at our Kansas City plant.","To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held their recent exchange rates for the remainder of 2016, we estimate that our expected full-year motorcycle segment revenue would be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. We would expect an unfavorable impact to gross margin of approximately $50 million driven by lapping last year\u2019s hedge benefits, an unfavorable impact to gross margin of nearly 1 percentage point on a full-year basis.","During the second quarter, we expect gross margin expressed as a percent of revenue to be down on a year-over-year basis, driven by, first, unfavorable currency exchange. Currency is expected to adversely impact gross margin by $25 million to $30 million in the quarter primarily due to lapping a year-ago hedge gain of $20 million, lowering gross margin by approximately 1.5 percentage points. Next, we expect shipment mix will continue to be unfavorable in Q2 behind a stronger shipment mix of cruisers and sportsters, supporting the strong demand we have seen in these segments and our recently announced new product introductions. Finally, we expect manufacturing costs to continue to be unfavorable behind higher year-over-year start-up costs.","Looking at SG&A, while we will invest a significant amount more in marketing and product development, we expect full year spending to be flat to up modestly from 2015. As a percent of revenue, we expect SG&A will decrease.","For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of increased borrowing costs and higher credit losses partially offset by increased revenues. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure, most notably the implementation of an ERP system. Finally, we continue to expect our full-year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 34.5%.","We are pleased to deliver a return to retail sales growth and stabilizing market share in the first quarter. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long term.","Thank you for your investment in Harley Davidson. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt.","Matthew Levatich","Thanks John, and good morning everyone. As we shared in January, our plan for 2016 and beyond increases our focus, investment and resolve to drive increased demand for our exceptional brand and products. I\u2019ll share with you some highlights on how we\u2019re progressing with the plan, but first I\u2019d like to provide my perspective on our first quarter results.","As John mentioned, we saw overall growth in worldwide retail sales reach 1.4%. It demonstrates the initial success we\u2019re having with our strategy to drive demand and deliver results in a highly competitive environment. As I\u2019ve said before, competition is a great thing for the entire industry and the customer. It drives us to be better than we\u2019ve ever been in every respect to grow our leadership position and run a strong and profitable business while we do so. We don\u2019t expect the current environment to change; in fact, we view it as the new normal, so we\u2019ll continue to take steps necessary to further strengthen the company and compete effectively in our quest to lead in every market.","As I reflect on the quarter, international continues to be a real bright spot with great results in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Canada. Our international retail sales have continued to grow and we anticipate growing international retail sales at a faster rate than in the U.S. over time. While retail sales were down half a percent in the U.S., they were an improvement over recent trends and we\u2019re working with diligent skill and commitment to maintain and enhance our leadership position here in the United States. Importantly, while we recognize we\u2019ve made progress in the first quarter, we also recognize we still have more to do and more to deliver.","So let\u2019s get to the key elements of our demand driving strategy. Harley Davidson enjoys customer loyalty and brand appeal that would be the envy of any business, and the core goal of our plan to drive demand is to build an even stronger, deeper bond with our existing loyal customers while creating powerful connections with new customers. To do this, we set our focus on four key areas: first, increase product and brand awareness; second, grow new ridership in the United States; third, increase and enhance brand access; and finally, accelerate the cadence and impact of new products. We kicked off a number of initiatives in these four areas at various points in the first quarter, some of which influenced first quarter performance and others we anticipate will bear fruit in the months and years ahead.","To increase product and brand awareness, we\u2019ve stepped up our advertising and PR presence in every region, taking full advantage of digital and traditional media to tell our story and the stories of our customers. We\u2019ve also increased our presence at major events and increased the number of demo opportunities for riders to experience firsthand our motorcycles, accessories and apparel that offer unlimited potential for them to make a unique and bold statement about who they are.","Nothing reinforces the fundamental appeal of our products and the many enhancements we\u2019ve made to our motorcycles in recent years better than a demo ride, so we\u2019ve been dialing up our demo opportunities around the world. In EMEA for example, the Discover More touring campaign more than doubled demand for demo rides during the first quarter compared to the same period in 2015. In Asia-Pacific, our increased media investment is driving greater awareness for the brand and our demo events with encouraging results. In Japan for example, demo rides are up 57% over last year, and Australia and New Zealand are seeing a substantial increase in demo rides year-over-year as well.","In the United States, we\u2019ve stepped up our presence at key events such as South by Southwest, the X Games, and of course Daytona Bike Week where we engaged riders and connected them with our great dealers. During Bike Week, we saw a 30% increase in the number of demo rides and a 27% increase in total retail sales of new motorcycles through local dealers as compared to 2015.","In mid-March, we launched the Live Your Legend integrated marketing campaign. This global campaign highlights real-life stories from current Harley Davidson riders, dealers and employees to encourage new riders to get out and live their legend. What is most powerful about the campaign is the message. It\u2019s a rallying cry to inspire the next generation of riders to act now and invest in the experiences that define their legacy. The emotional appeal of our brand crosses borders, cultures and generations. It\u2019s more than just a motorcycle; it\u2019s a way of life and a personal expression for millions of riders around the world, and it\u2019s inspiring others to pick up the sport and learn to ride on a Harley Davidson motorcycle.","Growing the sport of motorcycling in the United States is also about increasing our investment in the Harley Davidson Riding Academy. In the first quarter, we increased the number of dealers offering the program by 8% and the number of classes offered by 35%. Through March, our dealers trained over 8,000 students, a 37% increase from last year. A big driver of that increase is our incredibly successful Learn to Ride for Free program, which we\u2019re offering to current and former members of the U.S. military and first responders throughout 2016.","Increasing access to our brand through our dealers also remains an important demand catalyst, and we\u2019re continuing our progress in expanding and enhancing the dealer network, which we believe is the absolute best in the world and a key competitive advantage. During the first quarter, we opened new dealer points in Belgium, Brazil, Hong Kong, India and the Philippines. By 2020, we plan to add 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally.","Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about some awesome products. Our first quarter results reflect the strength and impact of our new 2016 motorcycles, including the refreshed Iron 883 and 48, as well as the S-series cruisers and the Road Glide Ultra. We announced the Low Rider S and the CVO Pro Street Breakout cruisers this quarter and started shipping them to dealerships in March. Just yesterday, we unveiled the new Harley Davidson Roadster to the world at a media event in Marseilles, France, and the reaction has been fantastic. This new model joins the Dark Custom line-up and is featured in the Live Your Legend campaign. We have included a link to the latest spot in today\u2019s earnings release, and I encourage you to check it out.","What I\u2019ve outlined here is just a sampling of the all-in comprehensive nature of our work to drive demand, work that leverages all the great and strong dimensions of our brand, further strengthening and reinforcing our incredible foundations of industry-leading products, experiences, customer passion and loyalty that are wrapped up in the Harley Davidson brand. These are investments that deliver the near-term results that will drive long-term performance and value for all our stakeholders. We\u2019re confident that our investments will generate interest, drive traffic and drive sales. We\u2019re also confident that they will enhance our already unrivalled industry and brand leadership and business performance too.","Before we move on to questions, I\u2019d like to share some important customer information with you. As you know, one of our strategic objectives is to grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of core customers and growing outreach at a faster rate. As highlighted in today\u2019s press release, for the eighth straight year we remain the number one seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to young adults age 18 to 34, to women, African Americans and Hispanics, as well as Caucasian men ages 35 and up. This is the case in the 601-plus cc segment and across all on-road motorcycles of all displacements. We continue to sell more Harley Davidson motorcycles to today\u2019s young adults than we did to the baby boomers when they were young adults, and we\u2019re bringing new riders of all ages into the sport. Over the last five years, an increasing number of on-road first-time riders in the United States has purchased new Harley Davidson motorcycles. In 2015, one-third of new Harley Davidson purchasers in the U.S. had not owned a motorcycle previously.","We know we\u2019ve got more to do and more to deliver. We\u2019re confident in the strength of our strategy, the passion of our people, and the power of our brand. The Harley Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength we\u2019ve built during our continuous 113-year history. No one else has a network of dealers like we do, made up of individuals who get up every day with the sole purpose of delivering exceptional Harley Davidson experiences. No one else has employees like ours, who take such great pride in creating and building legendary Harley Davidson motorcycles and delivering our unique experiences to every corner of the planet.","Our inspiration and our drive comes from our customers, millions of riders who yearn to experience personal freedom on their individual terms. This is what we do, and we do it like no one else.","With that, let\u2019s take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Go ahead, your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Morning, thanks for taking my question. With respect to the $70 million in redeployed spending, how will you measure success? I\u2019m guessing there may be a volume bogey that you need to reach in order to ensure the Harley-like ROI you\u2019re used to.","John Olin","Craig, this is John. We\u2019ve got numerous measures to measure the effectiveness, all the types of things that we\u2019re doing with regards to the $70 million. Again, that\u2019s made up of customer-facing marketing in things like Live Your Legend that Matt just talked about, Heroes Ride Free. We\u2019ve talked about training military folks and police and fire for free. We\u2019re seeing great results on that - as Matt mentioned, that\u2019s up 37%, so one of the measures is are we increasing the number of people we\u2019re training, and overall sales are up quite significantly when you look at graduates that are buying motorcycles, so that is clearly a volume measure there.","We\u2019ve also give Discover More Demos, and demos taking place all over the world. You know, the metrics on that is are we getting people on motorcycles, and we certainly follow through with those sales--or those demos to make sure that they\u2019re turning into sales and doing the follow-ups.","The other big thing that we\u2019re investing in is Battle of the Kings, which accentuates and highlights our customization and personalization, which is unique to Harley Davidson. So, all of these things are what we\u2019re doing to drive demand versus the alternative and the easy way out, which is the discount. So we\u2019re taking the high road on this, we\u2019re doing what builds the brand and creates customer loyalty, and we\u2019ve got measures across all of it. But you\u2019re absolutely right, Craig - at the end of the day, it\u2019s measured in are we selling more motorcycles to our customers.","Craig Kennison","If I could just segue to the new bikes that you\u2019ve launched recently in March and in May, what bikes are most likely to have the largest impact on volume among those three?","John Olin","Those three are all fantastic motorcycles. They will all have a big impact on motorcycles. You know, Craig, when we looked at the 2016 model year, we talked about a focus on cruisers, and we added a lot of power with a high output 103 engine across all [indiscernible] and Softails, and we came out with a couple S models at that time and refreshed sportsters. We\u2019ve now fortified it with three more models, two that began shipping at the end of the first quarter, the Low Rider S and the Pro Street Breakout, and then just announced yesterday the Roadster. They\u2019ve all got a place in the portfolio, and we\u2019ve talked about the tail strategy as we look to segment our customers and deliver what they\u2019re looking for, and so all of those are aimed at doing that and they\u2019re all going to be additive to the overall portfolio in driving the entire business forward.","Matthew Levatich","I\u2019ll just add to that, Craig - this is Matt. The other thing that new products like this do is they generate interest and they drive traffic, and that\u2019s a key part when we talk about the cadence and impact of new products. You\u2019re seeing both unfold in these three announcements. They generate interest, they drive traffic, they lead to sales of other motorcycles and overall the demand for Harley Davidson.","I\u2019ll just share a personal anecdote. On Facebook this morning, it was just lit up with people sharing the latest news about the Roadster, as well as the spot that we\u2019ve put out on that which is really cool, and just people are buzzing about Harley. So this is all part of the mix of driving demand.","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead, your line is open.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Just a couple here. John or Matt, any color that you can give us on used prices trends within each of the families, and then as it relates to HDFS, we\u2019ve been getting several questions, especially given what\u2019s going on in sub-prime auto which is clearly a different situation, but several questions regarding sub-prime. Where do you see that maxing out as a percent of your loan mix, and also maybe your level where you want to see delinquencies or credit losses max out.","John Olin","Tim, this is John. Talking about used prices, whenever we talk about used prices, we\u2019ve got to be clear on what market we\u2019re talking about. There is really three different markets the way we look at it. There is the market that bikes are sold in driveways, on eBay and those types of things. About two-thirds of the used bikes are sold in that market. We do not have a lot of data with regards to what\u2019s happening to used bike prices, supply-demand driven, very local. The other part of the market is used bikes that are sold in our dealership. About one-third of the used bikes go through our dealer network, and that we do have more data on. Then finally is the repo market. It\u2019s a very small market, only about 7% of overall used bike sales go through it, but an important market in that a lot of the services take that data and try to project it forward under retail prices, and it obviously has an impact because we sell repossessed motorcycles on our credit losses.","So when we look at the dealer network, we\u2019ve talked about through the better part of 2015, prices held up very well. We saw a little bit of softening in the fourth quarter, which we talked about last quarter. That softness has continued into the first quarter, and it\u2019s not out of line with what we\u2019re seeing in the industry, but it is a little bit softer. To answer your question on what\u2019s driving it or the lead of it is cruisers. Cruisers are falling more, and that\u2019s what we would expect because that\u2019s what we\u2019re investing in. We certainly saw it when Rushmore came out - you know, it was the touring bikes that fell more, so we\u2019re adding a lot of content with power in the new models and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing more softness, but that\u2019s also where we\u2019re adding a lot of the content.","Tim, the other question that you asked is on HDFS. I think the question was around sub-prime, and sub-prime has been about 20% of our portfolio. Over time, sub-prime has represented between 15% and 25%. Sub-prime is a fantastic business for us. We have tremendous returns on it and sell a lot of incremental motorcycles, and we are seeing sub-prime normalize a little bit. But the fact of the matter is for the last seven years, sub-prime has not behaved like sub-prime. It has performed extremely well and we have priced our models for more of a normalized sub-prime performance, and we are starting to see more of a normalization which we\u2019ve talked about in the last several quarters.","Overall, sub-prime is at about 20%. We do not have a target on sub-prime. Our objective is to do well-structured loans and we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to improve, but we do not have a target per se.","Tim Conder","Okay, and John, just to clarify that then, driving the higher losses, is that more the sub-prime or lower used prices? How would you characterize, I guess, the double buckets of driving the higher loan losses and delinquencies?","John Olin","Yes and yes. So the losses are up in the quarter, and they\u2019re driven by three things, Tim. Number one is weakness in the oil-dependent areas. Remember, a lot of local economies are in recession and there\u2019s a lot of layoffs in those areas, so we\u2019re seeing higher losses in oil-dependent areas of the United States. Number two is we see a continued normalization of sub-prime, and again sub-prime is starting to behave a little bit more like sub-prime, nothing of great concern because we\u2019ve priced for that. And then the third area is lower used prices that we\u2019re seeing at the auction, and we saw again softness in the first quarter at auction; however, they firmed up quite a bit in the month of March, so we\u2019ll keep a close eye on that. But it\u2019s all three.","But again, Tim, I want to reiterate that we\u2019ve talked about this for several years that we\u2019ve expected credit losses to normalize coming out of what has been a very great credit loss performance, and we\u2019re just starting to approach average levels of credit losses, so we feel very good about where we\u2019re at. We feel very good about the entire portfolio. It remains incredibly profitable and it\u2019s doing what we expected and what we guided on at the beginning of the year, and we expect HDFS income to be down modestly because of rising credit losses and higher interest expense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Go ahead, your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. I just wanted to get a little bit of color on your 1 to 3% shipment growth guidance. Obviously international is very strong, U.S. is a little bit soft, but how do you see that--and improved, by the way, the U.S. But how do you see that progressing throughout the year? Do you expect that difference to kind of narrow, that they become more similar in terms of their growth rates to achieve that 1 to 3% shipment growth guidance?","John Olin","Greg, when we look at the overall drivers, as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s certainly the brand fundamentals. The brand fundamentals have been strong over the last couple years and still remain very strong in the first quarter, and we\u2019d project that for the remainder of the year. Model year \u201916 is doing great. We\u2019ve got model year \u201917 line-up coming out here in several months. Outreach continues to grow faster than core, and we\u2019ve got $70 million of incremental money that we\u2019re spending. And as you pointed out, international growth is doing very well.","We expect both international and U.S. to be up in retail sales. U.S. is still down a little bit. We\u2019re very pleased to see a significant improvement from the way we exited last year to this year. We\u2019re not going to break out the split between the two, but again we feel very good about both our U.S. business and international business.","Greg Badishkanian","Just a follow-up - is there anything in, let\u2019s say, Europe or Asia, any best practices, any of the investments that you\u2019ve made that you think you could implement in the U.S. to accelerate sales here, just given the performance in those markets?","John Olin","Good question, Greg. You know, we\u2019re doing a lot of things across the world, and we talked about a lot of them - Live Your Legends, a worldwide campaign, Discover More demos. So what we\u2019re seeing in Europe is great blocking and tackling in terms of getting people on motorcycles and demoing them. We saw strong share improvement during the quarter in Europe - it was up half a point after several quarters of being soft because of a lot of new product entries. Battle of the Kings is a worldwide effort of dealers in Europe, Asia-Pacific and certainly in the United States, so we\u2019re always taking learnings that we\u2019ve got from any market and fast adapting them around the world.","But we are very pleased to see that Europe is up almost 9%, Asia-Pacific was up, and Japan within Asia-Pacific was very strong, which is great news especially after we took down about 25% of the dealers out of Japan last year, and felt that that would give us great footing moving forward and a better customer experience. We\u2019re seeing that pay off. So things around the world are going very well in the dealer network.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead, your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","Thank you, good morning. The increase in dealers offering Riding Academy, what was that on an absolute basis? Did you have 200 last year, so a net gain of 16 or so? And then also, I want to ask you, John, you were pretty quick in your commentary. Did you shipments will shift from 3Q to 2--sorry, from 3Q to 2Q owing to the Kansas City ERP implementation? Thanks.","John Olin","Okay, I\u2019m going to start with the second question, Gerrick. We are implementing an ERP system that will go live right after the end of the second quarter, so that will be implemented in the month of July, very similar if you remember when we did this in our York facility a few years ago. With that, we will lose a fair amount of production in the month of July. Production will be down about 30% in the month of July, so what you will see throughout the second quarter is a higher level of inventory because we\u2019re going to lose that production in July that we cannot make up in the rest of the third quarter.","Leading up to that, we\u2019re going to experience start-up costs in readying the organization and the plants to receive the system. It is a big implementation. It\u2019s bigger than what we did at our York facility. Primarily it\u2019s at Kansas City, but there\u2019s other aspects to the launch, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in manufacturing expense in the first quarter and you\u2019re going to see it for the next several quarters. So a lot of it gets capitalized, but there\u2019s a fair amount of expense that goes on and on a year-over-year basis is showing unfavorability, and that is to ready the organization, the training, the tabletop exercise, a lot of the testing that goes on, so we\u2019re going to see that for the next several quarters. But it will launch in the third quarter, and we will lose some production in July.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay.","John Olin","I think the other question that you asked, Gerrick, was with regards to the number of dealers that have Riding Academy. It\u2019s around 200, and we\u2019ve increased that by 8% in the first quarter here.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open.","Rod Lache","Good morning everybody. A couple questions. One is just to clarify the manufacturing $16 million headwind on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. Should we be expecting a similar magnitude in Q2 and Q3, given what you mentioned about the ERP implementation, and is there some kind of quantifiable return that you can convey from that investment as we look out beyond this year?","John Olin","Thanks Rod. Yes, we would expect manufacturing expense to be unfavorable in the next couple quarters, about the same level. Again, on a full-year basis, our operating margin will be between 16 and 17%, so we figured all of that in. There is absolutely a strong return associated with the investment, both in expense and start-up costs as well as capital. We\u2019ve seen that at our York facility and we\u2019ve continued to talk for the last several years about the strong productivity levels that are delivered. Certainly the ERP system is a part of delivering that productivity. We\u2019re getting common with facilities and certainly the systems that run them, and we\u2019re very excited and the folks in Kansas City are excited to receive this system and, again, continue to drive productivity forward.","We don\u2019t provide specific investment returns on the investments that we make, though.","Rod Lache","Okay, but at the very least it sounds like there\u2019s a non-recurrence of the $16 million a quarter when we look out to 2017.","John Olin","Absolutely.","Rod Lache","Okay. Just thinking about the $70 million increase in product development and marketing, I think that you guys were suggesting that this is a new normal level of investment. So should we just kind of plug that in, in addition to the normal relationship of 80% variable and 20% fixed on the SG&A? And also on the SG&A, you mentioned that you shifted some spending from Q1 to Q1. Can you give us some color on how we should expect Q2 to look, or what\u2019s the magnitude of the shift that you implemented?","John Olin","Yes, so when we look at the investment spending that we\u2019re doing to drive demand, again as Matt had mentioned, we are competing against wider price gaps and we\u2019re not going to compete by discounting. We\u2019re going to compete by driving equity into the brand, and with that we believe we need the $70 million to grow the business despite wider price gaps that we expect to continue into the future. Having said that, Rod, we expect that $70 million to continue on into the future.","A lot of that was funded out of taking other fixed costs out of our SG&A base, so overall we don\u2019t expect a big shift when we look at what\u2019s variable and fixed in SG&A because of this shift. It\u2019s going to be a part of our ongoing spending. We\u2019ve taken another $70 million out of our ongoing spending, and therefore there is not a big shift in the 80\/20 when we talked about fixed\/variable on SG&A.","Again, in the preamble we talked a little bit about a shift in timing. We expected there to be more SG&A--to be more unfavorable in the first quarter. It was $13 million higher, and we would expect certainly the second quarter to be higher and shift some of the spending in the first quarter into the second quarter. In aggregate on a full-year basis, we would expect SG&A to be about flat, up modestly, but we are going to see more of that spending taking place in the first three quarters because that\u2019s when the motorcycles take place and a lot of our marketing investment will happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, your line is open.","Joe Spak","Thanks for taking my questions. The first one centers around the new\/used you talked about. One would be if you could [indiscernible] that used to new ratio, and then what percent of new Harley purchases come with a Harley trade-in, because if the used prices continue to fall, are you at all worried about how that\u2019s going to manifest itself in terms of purchasing power go-forward and mix of new bikes?","And then the second question just relates to what\u2019s going over in Japan. What you know as of now, are there any disruptions to your supply chain, and then maybe you can remind us how in the past some of your Japanese competitors have reacted in the marketplace when they\u2019ve experienced production disruptions.","John Olin","All right, so the first question, Joe, was the used to new ratio. That has been about 2.4 to 1. It\u2019s up about a tenth of a point since 2014, so 2015 we had a shift in new to used. New sold at a faster rate than used, and that affected that ratio by about a tenth of a percent. As we\u2019ve talked about, we don\u2019t expect to see that ratio to change much. It inflected and it changed a fair amount in the downturn, and that is just more of the new normal. We would expect it to be in the 2.2 to 2.5 range for the long term.","The second question is with regards to, I think, our mix of sales in the United States is what you were asking. So right now, 33% of our sales is to folks that are new to Harley Davidson and new to motorcycling, so we call it new-new. They\u2019re new to the sport and new to Harley Davidson, which is one of the key focuses as we look to grow ridership in the United States. So we\u2019re very pleased with it, we believe it\u2019s a very strong percentage. When you look at that worldwide, that percentage is up in the 60s, so overall we\u2019re bringing a tremendous amount of new people in.","You know, we\u2019ve talked at different times and Matt mentioned it today about outreach. About 40% of the folks that buy a motorcycle in any given quarter or month are outreach customers and important to keep the business moving forward. So there is--on the percentage, I do not now it off the top of my head, which is folks that come with a trade-in. That has not changed dramatically on a year-over-year basis - that\u2019s part of the business and one of the reasons we\u2019re investing in motorcycles is to encourage people to trade up.","The third question that you asked was with regards to Japan, I think referring to the recent earthquakes in Japan. First of all, all of our employees and our dealers and their families are well. We sustained a little bit of damage to some of the dealerships, but it is an incredibly resilient country and they\u2019ll work through it. We do not see any disruption in the supply chain coming from Japan at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Go ahead, your line is open.","Jaime Katz","Thank you. Can you quantify maybe how much weaker the oil producing regions were performing relative to the aggregate performance across the enterprise, or is there a way to let us know what percentage of either sales or loans are coming from maybe Texas and western Canada together?","John Olin","Thanks Jaime. We talked about oil-dependent regions. I think in the last couple quarters what we\u2019ve seen in 2015 is softness starting in the first quarter, and that continued to deteriorate in the four successive quarters in 2015. It topped out at about low double-digit decline in retail sales in the fourth quarter. The good news is that it has not gotten worse in the first quarter; the bad news is it hasn\u2019t gotten better. So it has leveled off here, at least in the first quarter, and hopefully as we start to lap the successively weaker first quarter performance in 2015, it will get a little bit better here.","Overall, it does have an impact on our U.S. retail sales probably in the range of a percent and a half of retail sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays Capital. Go ahead, your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning, and thanks. Hey John and Matt, you guys have talked about the new marketing campaign and all your efforts there. I was just wondering how much of your total budget has been allocated to marketing that\u2019s run thus far?","John Olin","We don\u2019t provide an absolute dollar. I think in the 10-K, it provides what advertising expense was, Felicia, but if you\u2019re referring to the $70 million, the majority of that is increased customer facing marketing, which will be up 65%. So to try to give you a flavor for how impactful that would be, is all of the marketing spending that we do that impacts the customer and reaches the customer in some way, shape or form is up 65%, and then the smaller piece of that is an increase in product development. Again to dimensionalize that, that\u2019s about a 35% increase from levels that we will have had in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Hovorka from Raymond James. Go ahead, your line is open.","Joe Hovorka","Thanks. Actually, I\u2019m not sure if that is what Felicia just asked or not, [indiscernible]. How much of the $70 million was spent in the first quarter for the increased marketing?","John Olin","We do not--you know, we don\u2019t provide a breakdown of marketing spending by quarter, Joe. Sufficient to say that marketing spending was up quite a bit, over 50% increase, and again on a full-year basis we expect to be up 65% when we look at customer facing marketing. Then the other piece that you can see in the financials is product development spending was up a little bit over 7% in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Go ahead, your line is open.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Sort of a two-part question here on the inventory front. I guess first on the retail side, it seems like a pretty big number, and I know you\u2019re attributing that to new models. It seems like you\u2019ve got some new models every year and they normally sort of displace other models. I understood when it was Street, which was a whole new sort of line of bikes, but maybe walk us through just why the magnitude of that inventory build at retail. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re saying that any of it has to do with the third quarter production thing and sort of shipping out in front of that, but maybe walk us through that.","Then on the factory inventory side, up 30% in the fourth quarter, up 15% in the first quarter. Presumably that was a sizeable benefit to the 4Q gross margin as you get the higher fixed cost absorption. How should we think about that impact in the first quarter, and then as those inventories come back in line with prior year levels, maybe help us out with the impact and the timing of gross margin impact from inventories coming back in. Thanks.","John Olin","Okay. The first question is with regards to retail inventory, and it\u2019s up 4,900 units. When you look at the--you\u2019re right, James, that years we have models in and out, but when we look at from a year ago, there are five incremental models that we shipped. So with that, there are 730-ish dealers that need to have models on the floor, and if you do the math, it\u2019s, I think, less than a couple models for each of those. So that is the driver of why inventory is up, and those dealers need the models to sell.","In addition to that, though - that\u2019s the primary driver - is that we are carrying higher inventory because we are increasing marketing spending by 65%, most of that coming in the early part of the year. We want to make sure that the availability is there, and as we talked about, we pulled forward a lot of the production and we made some more in the fourth quarter of last year so that we could get out to a quick start. Part of the strategy has been to spend more marketing money in the south and get units there quicker, because they are not in--you know, their springtime happens a lot earlier than in the north. So we did that, and it\u2019s been effective.","With that, though, we had, as you pointed out, a higher level of inventory on the balance sheet at the end of the year, and it was up $137 million or 33%. That\u2019s come down significantly at the end of the first quarter. I think we\u2019re up 15%. That is driven by finished goods inventory, and we do have a higher level of inventory in finished goods at the second quarter. That is based on wanting to be able to supply the market as we invest more, and the fact that we have an ERP system that is coming at the end of the second quarter.","So overall inventories that we have, whether they be on the balance sheet or in the market, will be elevated in the second quarter because we\u2019ve got to get that trajectory to have enough inventory to bridge the ERP implementation and deliver the model year \u201917 motorcycles in the third week of August, so you will see it higher. That inventory will come out as the year progresses.","We did shift more production into the fourth quarter last year, and we had talked about some of the inefficiencies and the time that our workers were off and we put that in. That should be viewed as more of a one-time adjustment and that production will be at similar levels in the fourth quarter of this year, so you\u2019re not going to see a big impact. The impact was in lower production in the first quarter here, which is part of the unfavorable manufacturing expense as we did not produce as much in the first quarter because we carried forward more from the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Go ahead, your line is open. Mr. MacGregor, please unmute your line and go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes, sorry about that. Thanks. Just a quick question on the $70 million promotional spend. Does this investment support market share stabilization, or should we see growth from this?","John Olin","The $70 million supports retail sales, supports market share and all those types of things. This is the way that we are going to combat expanded price gaps without discounting, so--and it is going to drive our business forward. You know, when we talk about overall market share and what we talked about, I believe, last quarter is we\u2019re looking to stabilize overall market share in the United States, and over the last couple quarters we have seen U.S. market share stabilize and Europe as well. Matter of fact, Europe is growing in the first quarter here. So the idea is to first stabilize market share and then is to grow at retail.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Neel Mehta from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, your line is open.","Neel Mehta","Thanks and good morning everyone. Just two questions. First off, moving forward in the medium to long term, where should we expect the bulk of the product development spending to be going? Do you see potential to expand your lower priced offerings in the street\/sportster segment to accelerate growth, particularly in emerging market customers and younger demographics?","And then just a second question on HDFS. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for average loan term and loan-to-value for bans financed through HDFS, and how that\u2019s been trending over time, and maybe if you have any color on what the competitors are doing on the financing front. Thank you.","John Olin","All right, Neel. I\u2019ll take the second question first, and then Matt will finish up with the answer to your first question. HDFS average loans over the last year or two have been largely flat. We have not seen an expansion of that, we have not changed our terms in terms of length of loans for, I\u2019d say, 15 years, so there hasn\u2019t been a change there.","Matthew Levatich","So Neel, with respect to product, we\u2019ve talked over the last several years about our product investment strategy being focused in a balanced way on three different growth and performance categories, and they\u2019re customer categories. One is with our traditional core customers, one is with international growth opportunities in customers, and the other is with outreach. What we do with the product development investment is seek to put the right balance across those three customer-led strategies and make sure we have an offering that is going to drive the growth and performance of the business from a customer perspective in those three categories. So it will vary year to year or within a year, but over time we\u2019re looking for that balance to grow the impact of the business where the market for Harley Davidson is strongest.","Amy Giuffre","All right, thank you guys, and thank you everyone for your time.

Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC.

Matt, let's get started.","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019ve closed out our third quarter with results that included EPS and operating margin that were ahead of expectations and in addition, we made noteworthy progress which I\u2019ll get into here today. ","As we shared in September, we\u2019ve sharpened the focus of our objectives to build riders in the United States and made clear how we plan to invoke the power of our brand in new ways to deepen the commitment of riders now and into the future. ","Our strategy and commitment to build riders is driving deeper understanding and broader capabilities that are and will continue to propel our company forward and our operating discipline along with our dealers\u2019 efforts continue to bring increasing business stability in this dynamic marketplace. ","Guiding all our efforts is deeper analysis and insights on why people engage, participate and disengage from riding. Our advanced analytics capabilities and rider migration database have evolved into a powerful asset and a wealth of information and inspiration for us. ","We know more than ever about how to attract people to riding and keep them engaged to build committed riders and we know how this applies, no matter what their experience level, age or life stage. ","We have two primary focus areas, attracting more people to riding and keeping riders riding. Our execution might be different for young adult versus a returning rider. But the essence of our work is the same across the customer spectrum. ","We are bringing precise focus to how we influence each customer at their decision points to build the total number of committed Harley-Davidson riders, where we\u2019ve previously had an objective to build 2 million new riders in the U.S., we now know why, where, how and what we can do to work both sides of the equation attracting and retaining to increase the total number of riders. ","We\u2019ve done the math considering demographics in used bikes and we\u2019ve set targets for new riders we need to attract and retention rates that we need to achieve 4 million total U.S. Harley-Davidson riders by 2027. ","Reframing these objectives helps us sharpen our work on both increasing the pools of incoming riders and better activating passions of new and existing riders. This is an important refinement that underscores what we\u2019ve said for several years now. ","Our mission is about activating riding. The power of this refinement is in the focus that our entire enterprise has on building new riders and keeping all riders in the saddle and enjoying the ride. ","In September, we also shared that we are directing investment, building capabilities and structuring the organization to activate the Harley-Davidson brand more powerfully. We are intensifying our rider-centric approach to spark passion that deepens rider commitment. In line with this focus, we\u2019ve added Amplified Brand as a growth catalyst in the More Roads to Harley-Davidson\u2019s plan. Our brand efforts will bolster the existing growth catalyst of new products, broader access and stronger dealers. ","We activated this additional growth catalyst during the quarter and started to embed it in all of our work. We are digging in and focusing investment to faster model culture and build an even bigger, more passionate community of Harley-Davidson riders across all aspects of the riding journey. ","In Q3, our marketing spend was up over 30% and our efforts included LiveWire and LowRider S television spots running in major markets across the United States, which helped to generate over 700 million impressions. ","We also continued rolling out a refreshed brand look at major events during the quarter including Sturgis, World Surf League and Spartan races and we announced we will be the presenting sponsor at next summer\u2019s hotly anticipated Hella Mega music experience tour featuring Green Day, Weezer and Fall Out Boy. ","During the quarter, we also sharpened our objective to grow our international business to 50% of annual HDMC revenue by 2027. Previously the growth measure was motorcycle unit volume. As we see the opportunities we have for growth globally, unit volume of traditional products will be less a proxy for revenue that it has been in the past. ","Revenue better captures all our efforts including things like e-bicycles, and a refreshed apparel approach. We remain very focused and optimistic about our growth prospects outside the United States. We have the research insights momentum and even sharper plans to create new pathways to Harley-Davidson and expand access and appeal for more people around the world. ","Simply put, we are working to make riding matter more to more people and we are building on a position of strength. Never have there been more Harley-Davidson riders. In 2018, there were over 1.3 million in international markets and 3 million in the United States. Compared to 2010, in the U.S., we saw growth across all ages including young people. ","In fact, contrary to some perceptions, the data shows a 1.5 times incident rate increase for 18 to 29 year olds in 2018 versus 2010. We know more about these riders than we ever have. A research helps us understand why and when people become riders and why and when along their riding journey they leave, which has informed our work to activate riders along the participation lifecycle. ","Our insights inform not just our opportunity in the U.S., but the focus of our efforts around the globe. We see a significant opportunity to interact with tens of millions of people around the world who are curious about Harley-Davidson or interested in becoming a Harley-Davidson rider. As we strengthen our focus to attract new riders and deepen rider commitment, we\u2019ve got more in our product pipeline than ever before. ","We are also honing our research in international markets and will continue to use geographic and rider insights to drive targeted actions at the local and market level. In the slide deck, you will see a revised graphic that depicts the key structural elements of our strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders. ","As shown, the catalysts are interconnected and working in concert. To meet our objectives, we must successfully leverage all catalysts. A perfect example of this, an initiative that touches every aspect of our More Roads plan is our leadership in the electrification of motorcycles. ","Our work to further Harley-Davidson and the industry is generating valuable learnings and cultivating capabilities that are both exercising the organization and propelling us forward. It\u2019s tough and rewarding work and we are hungry for the challenge. ","As I\u2019ve mentioned before, our grit defines our culture as does our unrelenting drive to deliver for our riders. During the quarter, we crossed a historic threshold when the first LiveWire motorcycles made their way down our new production line at our facility in New York, Pennsylvania. And today, LiveWire motorcycles are being produced and delivered to dealers and customers across the U.S. and Canada. ","Leading in this new space requires agility, and a clear commitment to the first principles of quality and integrity and we are demonstrating both. We are deploying rigorous protocols for product quality and integrity and facing first mover challenges head on. ","Since day one, it\u2019s been essential that we set the bar for what high-performance, no excuses electric motor cycle should be and the media have all but crowned that achievement. We take pride in the rigorous quality standards and controls we employ in our drive to lead the industry and deliver the world\u2019s best motorcycle. ","We know our dealers and customers are eagerly awaiting LiveWire and we are ensuring it will exceed their expectations. LiveWire is an exceptional motorcycle. Our expectations for retail sales consider the premium nature of this product and the premium sets the bar for the industry and paves the way for the balance of our electric product portfolio we will introduce over the next several years. ","A portfolio designed to appeal to customers who will enjoy the thrill and ease of 'twist-and-go' acceleration across a range of price points and design features suited to a variety of uses. We have something in our plan for almost everyone starting with three year olds. ","And on that note, during the quarter, we delivered to our dealers the first IRONe electric-powered two-wheelers for kids, a result of our StaCyc acquisition earlier this year. The thrill of riding is now being appreciated by kids and their families. It\u2019s incredible to witness and our U.S. dealers are powering up family fun activations. ","This is a demonstration of our strategy, a comprehensive approach to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders. ","As we attract new customers, we continue to reward existing riders and brand fans. In Q3, we also brought to market a terrific array of 2020 motorcycles and gear to ignite their passion. We are seeing strong demand for the Low Rider S and CVO Tri Glide and great response to the significant technology we added to class-leading model year 2020 motorcycles. ","The team is laser-focused on building riders today and preparing us and our dealers to welcome a broader array of new riders moving forward. ","Positive momentum in Q3 from our broader access and stronger dealers, initiatives was driven by a stronger mix of value-driving equity marketing as we dial in and dial back sales incentives and further improved capabilities such as dealer digital programs and lead management tools deployed across our dealer network.","Stronger dealers retail marketing and dealer operations consulting teams continue their onsite dealer visits and operations evaluations in the U.S. and international markets to assess and provide the tools and process support dealers need to take their business to the next level. Participating dealers are seeing improved results across many areas of their business including sales of new and used bikes, P&A and apparel. ","In addition to product sales improvement, dealers who engage in operations consulting are seeing a 10% increase in service revenue compared to other dealers in their district and retail marketing consulting is driving a 20% average increase in unique website visits for participating dealers. We and our dealers continue the groundwork to be nimbler and more responsive to market and customer demands. ","Our efforts in Q3 drove increased business stability with predictable performance in most areas of the business and we are encouraged by trends in retail sales results globally. We are confident our strategy and sharpened focus will drive even more positive results going forward. ","In the U.S. and in all our markets, we continue to maximize value while we invest in future strength and growth. We are walking this line in all we do with keen awareness and focus. We will do more with the Harley-Davidson brand drive relevance, inspire ridership and make riding matter more to more people. ","So with that, I will turn it over to John to discuss the financial results for the quarter. John?","John Olin ","Thanks, Matt. In the third quarter, we were pleased to deliver EPS and Motorcycle segment operating margin ahead of expectations. The worldwide retail sales rate improved during the quarter versus the first half of 2019. We also made good progress as we continue to execute our More Roads with the Harley-Davidson plan to drive future growth. ","The summary of our Q3 results is on Slide 13. In the third quarter, Motorcycle segment operating income was impacted by lower shipments, higher year-over-year tariffs and unfavorable mix partially offset by lower year-over-year SG&A and the benefit of our manufacturing optimization initiatives. ","Financial services operating income was down 13.0%. Consolidated net income was down versus prior year due to lower operating income. EPS for the quarter was $0.55. When excluding restructuring plan cost and the impact of recent EU and China tariffs, adjusted EPS was $0.70. ","We remained focused and disciplined on tightening retail inventory, aggressively managing costs, generating cash from operations, and delivering strong shareholder returns over the long-term.","On Slide 14, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the third quarter were down 1.2% versus prior year. International retail sales were up 2.7% driven by growth in both our developed and emerging markets. ","In the U.S., Q3 retail sales were down 3.6% versus prior year, which represents an improvement in the sales rate over recent quarters. Our retail sales benefited from our actions and the tempering of the industry\u2019s retail sales declines. We expect our business to remain under pressure as the U.S. and developed international markets continue to face substantial headwinds.","The global competitive environment remains intense with aggressive promotional activity in the U.S., and worldwide new product introductions. We expect to overcome these market challenges by focusing on our intensified efforts to execute our More Roads plan and to build committed riders. We believe that we have a strong plan for the future and we are executing with great urgency. ","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the U.S. on Slide 15. In the U.S., Q3 retail sales were down behind lower, but improved industry retail sales performance and softer market share. Third quarter industry retail sales were down 1.7%. The industry\u2019s third quarter performance represents the lowest year-over-year rate of decline in the last fourteen consecutive quarters. ","On a year-to-date basis, the industry was down 3.9% versus a decline of 8.7% during the same period last year. Similarly, Harley-Davidson\u2019s year-over-year retail sales rate of decline tempered in the third quarter as compared to recent quarters and was in line with our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, Harley-Davidson\u2019s retail sales decline of 5.6% compares favorably to last year\u2019s decline of 10.2%. ","We believe this improved rate of decline was driven by improved industry performance, our focus on stronger dealer growth catalyst and increased marketing investments. ","During the quarter, our market share of new bike registrations in the U.S. was 49.8%, down 1.1 percentage points and stronger performance in segments which we do not currently compete but plan to compete in by the end of next year as we execute our More Roads plan. ","Harley-Davidson gained 2.2 percentage points of market share during the quarter within our Touring and Cruiser segments, which represents approximately 70% of the total 601 plus CC industry. In the second and third quarters, we increased the execution of our stronger dealer growth catalysts and increased brand marketing, while dialing back on our short-term focus sales incentives. ","During the third quarter, we reduced our year-over-year sales incentives, but did offer a two week finance incentive on carryover motorcycles aimed to driving dealership traffic in conjunction with the arrival of our new Model Year motorcycles and to further reduce our dealers\u2019 carryover inventory. We tightly manage shipments of new motorcycles into the dealer network in the quarter. ","This resulted in the quarter end U.S. retail inventories decreasing approximately 550 motorcycles versus prior year. We were pleased with the dealer inventory levels and the mix of our new product, our new model year bikes at the end of the quarter. We believe this market discipline is important in maintaining consumer and dealer value and will ultimately result in stronger retail sales of new motorcycles. ","On Slide 16, third quarter international retails sales were up 2.7% versus prior year. Q3 retail sales were up in both our developed and in our emerging markets. Emerging markets retail sales were up 4.7% during the quarter led by growth in ASEAN markets. ASEAN markets benefited from reduced pricing, which was enabled by the elimination of tariffs due to supplying these markets from our plant in Thailand. ","Strong growth in these markets was partially offset by softness in India and Mexico. Retail sales in developed markets were up 1.8% during the quarter. Our developed markets\u2019 Q3 retail sales rebounded from the second quarter, which was down 13.6%. During the quarter, we delivered solid retail sales growth in Australia, Canada, and Japan, which all have been down over the past several quarters. ","We believe that strength in Japan was partially aided by an increase in the country\u2019s consumption tax which went into effect on October 1st. Western Europe retail sales were down slightly, but significantly improved from the decline in the second quarter. ","Our year-to-date market share in Europe was 8.9%, down 1.5 percentage points versus prior year. Our market share was adversely impacted by lapping last year\u2019s strong Softail results and by lower sales of Street motorcycles due to the impact of implementing the Street recall. We remain confident in and committed to the great potential that exists in our international markets. ","We believe our More Roads plan supports the strength of our brand, products and distribution to this \u2013 drives growth \u2013 sustainable growth internationally. ","On Slide 17, wholesale motorcycle shipments in Q3 were down 5.8% and roughly at the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, family mix shifted from Touring to Cruiser Motorcycles versus last year\u2019s third quarter.","On Slide 18, revenue for the Motorcycles segment was down 4.9%, behind a 5.8% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Average motorcycle revenue per bike was essentially flat. A less rich product mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange were offset by higher year-over-year pricing and reduced sales incentives. ","Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing of our new model year 2020 motorcycles increased approximately 0.5%. Adjusting for the cost of the new content, pricing increased approximately 0.2 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue. ","On Slide 19, gross margin in Q3 was down as a result of lower shipments, product mix and unfavorable currency, partially offset by favorable manufacturing expense and slightly higher pricing. Product mix was unfavorable by $18.5 million in the quarter driven by family, model, P&A and general merchandize mix. ","Q3 gross margin was adversely impacted by $3.8 million of unfavorable currency. Q3 revenue was down nearly 1 percentage point due to stronger U.S. dollar, which was largely offset by hedge gains. ","In Q3, manufacturing expense was favorable versus prior year driven largely by savings resulting from the implementation of our manufacturing optimization initiatives, partially offset by lower absorption and lower production and shipments. In addition, Q3 tariffs impacts of $21.6 million were up $11.3 million versus prior year. ","On Slide 20, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q3 was lower compared to last year, driven by lower gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A and restructuring expenses. SG&A was lower than prior year as we continue to aggressively manage cost and reinvest savings in our More Roads plan and in increased marketing investments.","Restructuring charges for the manufacturing optimization totaled $7.6 million in the third quarter, down $7.2 million from prior year. Profitability was strong. Profitability and cash flow remain a key focus. It is our objective to further leverage and build our capabilities to continue to drive profit, cash flow and top quartile motor company ROIC. ","Financial Services segment third quarter operating income shown on Slide 21 was $72.9 million, down 13.0% compared to the prior year. Net interest income was up $1.1 million due to higher year-over-year receivables and favorable interest rate yields, largely offset by higher interest expense. ","The provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was $11.4 million unfavorable in the quarter, driven by higher credit losses and an increase in Q3 2019 reserve rate compared to a decrease in the reserve rate in Q3 2018.","Operating expenses were up versus prior year as a result of a Q4 2018 reporting change in which Harley-Davidson Dealer Systems business moved from the Motorcycle segment to the Financial Services segment and due to higher depreciation as a result of our investment in a new loan management system, which was implemented in January 2019.","HDFS' operational results are on Slide 22. Q3 retail originations were up 0.8% versus prior year driven by an increase in used bike loan originations. HDFS\u2019 market share was 67.6%. At the end of the quarter, there was $380.3 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $1.33 billion of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities. During Q3, HDFS paid dividends of $50 million to Harley-Davidson Inc. ","On Slide 23, both our 30-day plus delinquencies and credit losses were adversely impacted as expected by startup inefficiencies resulting from the implementation of our new loan management system in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect the system implementations impact on key metrics to be largely behind us. ","The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on balance sheet in Q3 was 3.75% or 15 basis points higher than last year\u2019s Q3 rate, but sequentially improved from Q2 2019, which was up 24 basis points. The annualized retail credit loss rate for receivables on balance sheet was 1.83%.","Q3\u2019s loss rate increase of 28 basis points was slightly above Q2 2019, which was up 26 basis points as it takes time for the increased delinquent loans resulting from the LMS system implementation to roll through to credit losses. ","To a lesser extent, third quarter credit losses were also adversely impacted by softer motorcycle prices at auction. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 24. Our quarter end cash and marketable securities balance was $862.4 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $848.6 million was down versus last year, driven by higher working capital, and lower net income. ","Regarding liquidity, the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. We believe the charts on Slide 25 demonstrate that we are a leader in ROIC at the Motor Company and ROE at HDFS, and we are a clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders. ","One of the five objectives guiding our business strategies and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by Motor Company ROIC in the top quartile of the S&P 500 and by best-in-class return on equity at HDFS.","Slide 26 illustrates the recent history of returning cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter of 2019, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and repurchased 112.5 million of our stock. Driving superior value for our shareholders is a top priority. We have a robust and disciplined process for our investment decisions. ","We look for opportunities to grow value through investments that maximize the performance and long-term potential of the company and the brand. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 27 is a summary of our multiyear manufacturing optimization. Annual ongoing cash savings are expected to be $65 million to $75 million after 2020. We continue to expect $25 million to $30 million in savings for 2019 and we realized $16.7 million of these savings in the third quarter.","For the full year, we continue to expect to incur $40 million to $50 million of operating expense. Manufacturing optimization costs were $10.0 million in Q3. We believe these investments have very attractive returns. They simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus in our operational investments and expect to improve gross margin by roughly one and a quarter percentage points.","Moving on, our 2019 full year guidance on Slide 28 remains unchanged from Q2 with the exception of the 2019 capital spending. We now expect capital spending to be $205 million to $225 million, which is $20 million lower than our previous guidance. ","On the yields of last quarter\u2019s approval by the EU to allow favorable tariff treatment of our Softail and Sportster motorcycles produced in our Thailand facility, we remain on track to begin producing motorcycles in Thailand by the end of October for sale in the EU allowing time for transportation and flow through of high tariff inventory, we continue to expect to begin mitigating EU tariffs in early Q2 of 2020. ","For the full year 2019, we now expect impacts of recent EU and China tariffs to be approximately $105 million. This is a $5 million increase from prior expectations and is driven by an increase in Section 301 tariffs, which remained very fluid as they continue to shift with global trade negotiations. ","For 2020, we now expect annualized 301 tariff impacts to be approximately $20 million. We are currently evaluating alternatives to help mitigate the impacts of these new tariffs. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship approximately 38,500 to 43,500 motorcycles. ","Also in the fourth quarter, we expect motorcycle operating margin as a percent of revenue to be a loss of approximately 5.5% representing an improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter margin. ","Fourth quarter results are expected to be adversely impacted by lower shipments, unfavorable mix, approximately $14 million of higher year-over-year tariff costs and unfavorable currency, partially offset by favorable SG&A behind lapping Q4 2018 recalls. ","To wrap up, during the quarter, we progressed against our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan that addresses today\u2019s marketplace challenges and the tremendous opportunities that exists in our international markets. ","As we look through the remainder of 2019, we are encouraged by the momentum of retail sales trends through the first nine months of this year but also recognize the substantial headwinds that we continue to face. Looking longer-term, we are prepared for an extremely dynamic and highly competitive global marketplace. We are committed to driving long-term growth for the company and strong returns for our shareholders. ","Thank you. And now, let\u2019s take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Joseph Altobello","Thanks. Hey guys. Good morning. So, first question, I want to delve into the international retail improvement. Obviously, pretty significant quarter-over-quarter and you talked about some of the drivers of that in Japan, the consumption tax for example. But want to get a better sense for what drove the improvement in Europe and Canada beyond that. ","John Olin ","Okay, Joe. This is John. With regards to the improvement that we saw quarter-over-quarter, one very \u2013 I am very pleased with it. Second quarter, we had the developed markets down 13.6% and they were up 1.8%. ","All developed markets improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Canada, Australia, and Japan all posted pretty strong gains on a year-over-year basis and that\u2019s a first time in several quarters that they\u2019ve been up year-over-year and Western Europe, while it was down slightly, still had some significant improvement. ","As we look across all of them, we\u2019ve talked about stronger dealer efforts, which started about five or six quarters ago in the United States. We\u2019ve been looking to fast the depots\u2019 efforts into our international markets. ","And you are seeing some of that come through in the third quarter. So, Joe, for example, on the dealer sales incentives, we changed our dealer sales incentives in the United States about four quarters ago, just changed them in the third quarter internationally. Much more simplified dealers certainly got a lot more clarity as what they are doing on retail sales and we believe that benefited. ","Second aspect is, we really fell off, the dealer network fell off a little bit on the demo rides and test rides that they were doing. We got that was back on track in the third quarter. And then finally, similar to the United States, as we look to amplify the brand, we increased our brand equity marketing in international markets in the third quarter, as well. ","Joseph Altobello","That\u2019s very helpful, John. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up, in terms of the operating margin outlook, you mentioned fourth quarter minus 5.5% but that\u2019s a GAAP number. I think on an adjusted basis, you are probably looking at something \u2013 if you are looking at a full year 10% margin, fourth quarter adjusted operating margins are likely going to be up modestly, is that the case? ","John Olin ","They will be improved. I don\u2019t have that number in front of us. Basically, it peel out the tariffs which are going to be up incrementally $14 million, as well as the year-over-year manufacturing optimization spending. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, Joe. ","Joseph Altobello","Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Jaime Katz ","Hi, good morning. I am curious if you guys have factored the promotional environment into your outlook for the full year. I mean, if you have and what impact it might have on the ability to capture rising prices and revenues in the quarter ahead and into next year? Thanks. ","Matt Levatich","Hi, Jaime. If I am understanding the question, first of all, we are in a higher promotional environment today. As we look quarter-over-quarter, we believe that about half of our competitors have increased amount of promotional activity from last year to this year. And at the same time, they are doing that, we are starting to back off of somewhat we would call sales incentives. ","And that\u2019s promotional offers and finance offers. And so, again, when we look at the results that we posted in the United States in Q3, while they were down, that certainly tempered, but that was in the phase of pulling back on some of the sales incentives that we had been offering. They are actually down about 50% in the third quarter. ","As we look across the full year, we are continuing to look to shift money from sales incentive into more brand equity-based and more sustainable marketing. ","Jaime Katz ","Okay. And then, I think in the prepared remarks, there were some comments that there was an expectation of retail sales for LiveWire. Would you care to share that with us?","Matt Levatich","I don\u2019t think there was, Jaime. We do not provide model level shipment or retail sales data. What we did on LiveWire is we began shipping in the last week of September. And so we had some shipments, but on the 40,000 units or so that we shipped is very minor and we are just very excited to have LiveWire in the market and starting to deliver to our customers. ","Jaime Katz ","Thank you. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone. John, the question was on HDFS and just you are looking at an increase in your provisioning, I think it was $11 million increase in provisioning and you talked about financing promotions and it sounds like maybe you are dialing those back a little bit now. ","But can you talk about the extent to which the provision increases were a function of the financing promotions versus maybe other factors and to what extent do you expect that provisioning to pullback now that maybe you are easing back on the promotions?","John Olin ","Thanks, David. We don\u2019t \u2013 there is \u2013 we don\u2019t believe that there is anything with regards to the finance offers driving those higher provisions. So what you are referring to is in the quarter, we had an increased provision of $11.4 million and that was driven by about half of that is driven by higher credit losses and we talked about that for the last several quarters. ","The majority of that is being driven by the LMS system implementation and the startup that we had and as we\u2019ve got things going, we expect those to be largely behind us. But in the third quarter, the majority of that was driven by the LMS. The other half of it simply is the provisioning in the reserves on a year-over-year basis and we look at those reserves are made up of two things. ","One is the reserves that we have booked this year and those are slightly higher in the third quarter. But the biggest piece of the reserves is what happened in the 2018 third quarter is we actually reduced reserves by a fair amount and so we are just lapping that. ","So that provision is made up of two pieces, credit losses as well as the reserves about half and half. There is not a significant impact due to the promotions that we\u2019ve had or the finance offers that we\u2019ve made. ","David MacGregor","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Sharon Zackfia ","Hi, good morning. John, I wanted to ask a question about the motorcycle operating margin in the quarter. I think, originally you have guided for it to be about 300 basis points and it was kind of down half of that. So, could you give us some color on what the price of the positive on the motorcycle margins? ","John Olin ","Great and thanks for the question, Sharon. I love to share this one with you. You are absolutely right. It came in about 1.5 points favorable and that\u2019s largely driven by lower SG&A and to that reason and why I say I am glad you asked it is, our employees have done an absolutely fantastic job of becoming more efficient evaluating every dollar that they spend and as we\u2019ve talked about for quite some time is we are looking to fund our More Roads investment internally. ","And so, while we\u2019ve got those costs rising on More Roads, as well as our Amplifying the Brand, we\u2019ve increased marketing, as Matt had mentioned over 30% in the quarter. All of that was paid for by our employees doing their jobs and doing them more efficiently every day. So, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with that. ","And so, that came in higher than what we expected and on the quarter basis, SG&A was lower by about a $1.5 million, again, absorbing all the cost with our More Roads and a 30% increase in marketing expending. We couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with that performance. ","Sharon Zackfia ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","James Hardiman","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, some of my questions are answered, but I wanted to maybe circle back on one of the \u2013 somewhat \u2013 one of the questions I\u2019ve got a lot coming out of the Analyst Day and that\u2019s how to think about gross margins in 2020. Just as a point of clarification, I think you guys mentioned that with some of the new middle weight bikes, gross margins would be down. But, am I wrong in saying, that\u2019s on a pro forma basis excluding tariffs. But that, when we factor in the tariffs gross margins should still be up next year. And maybe just lay out \u2013 you mentioned some stuff in the prepared remarks about tariffs this year and next. Maybe just give us the best estimate right now based on the timetable of when you are going to be up and running in Thailand and shipping into the EU. Just how much of a tariff benefit should we expect in 2020? ","John Olin ","Okay, James. First of all, we have not provided a guidance on gross margin in 2020 and the middle weights will not have a significant impact in 2020, because they will come out later in the year. We will provide more guidance on operating margin next quarter. ","But in general, we\u2019ve said over the next three year period of time, or through 2022 is that, we would face some gross margin headwinds because of the new products that we\u2019re coming out with \u2013 that are coming out at very strong margins. ","But just not at the same level as the products that we\u2019ve been delivering for 116 years in our Touring and Cruiser bikes. And with that headwind, some of that will be offset by the absorption and the higher growth that we expect coming out of those investments. But then overall, operating margin would increase through the period of \u2013 or through 2022 as we further leverage SG&A. ","So, that\u2019s what\u2019s been said about gross margin. When we talk about tariffs, and I had mentioned in the prepared remarks is that, tariffs are expected to be a $105 million this year. And that\u2019s made up of three component pieces. Approximately $90 million of that change is EU tariffs, right? And with that, we expect to mitigate the vast majority of them. ","There is a couple models that we will continue to ship from the United States. But that will come in early in the second quarter. So, the timing is, is that we will start producing in late October in Thailand. There is time on the water. It will arrive in the EU market at the end of 2019, in the beginning of 2020. We need time to burn off the existing inventory. ","We are taking down production right now and limiting as much inventory of the high tariff bikes as we can into the market. The low tariff bikes will enter into the market in early January, late this year and will flow through the system and we believe by early second quarter, we will begin mitigating the tariffs in Europe. ","So on a year-over-year basis, it will be the $90 million less what we are able to \u2013 we will still have tariffs in the first quarter. ","The second component of it is, tariffs of shipments that we\u2019ve had from the United States into China, that represents this year about $7 million. Those bikes are currently being produced in Thailand today and being shipped into China today. ","And we are a little bit earlier in the cycle than we are in EU and right now we are burning off the high tariff inventory into the bikes in China and by the beginning of the year, we would expect to be able to mitigate the vast majority of that $7 million of tariffs by the very beginning of 2020. And then the third component is about $8 million of 301 tariffs. ","And this is the component that\u2019s increased from last quarter to this quarter and that\u2019s the advent of List 4 that went into effect on September 1st and the expectation of List 4A and another List 4 set of products becoming implemented in the middle of December. Again, this is very volatile and it\u2019s what we know today and it seem to change quite often. ","But given the timing of when these are, we would expect List 4 products to be approximately $20 million in 2020. And so, that would be an incremental increase in those tariffs by about $12 million, James. And we are looking to mitigate those through \u2013 largely through resourcing the products. ","James Hardiman","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Craig Kennison ","Thanks. Just a quick two-part question. First on James\u2019s question. As it relates to the EU tariff and then $90 million this year, should we just take one quarter of that and apply it into next year? And then, Matt, as it relates to the U.S. economy today, what\u2019s your view on things? Unemployment is low, but recession periods are rising. I am curious what your take is overall. ","John Olin ","I\u2019ll answer the first part, Craig. With regards to the first quarter, we are going to be in the neighborhood of that. We will provide more granularity at the end of January when we do our call and we will see the inventories, what ended up in market and so on and so forth. But by and large, we are early into the second quarter is when those tariffs would be mitigated. ","Matt Levatich","Okay, Craig, it\u2019s Matt. Yes, thanks for the question. If I had that crystal ball, I would be utilizing it on a daily basis. I think the market continues, whether you are talking at the corporate level or the consumer level to face quite a bit of uncertainty regarding all manner of sort of economic stability related to the tariffs and obviously the political Presidential campaign and so forth. ","But having said that, sitting here right now, I don\u2019t think that that uncertainty is higher than it was six months ago and in fact, seeing the industry pick up that we saw in the third quarter is obviously an encouraging sign. ","I would just say that, from a company perspective, we are looking at our business with the abundance of caution necessary in an environment like this and that underscores how pleased we are with the increased predictability and performance to plan that we see in our business. ","We\u2019ve done a nice job really dialing in our measures and our dashboard of how things are moving, keeping inventory very tight, being very nimble in production and shipments, recognizing that we are in probably the most uncertain forward environment that we\u2019ve been in, in a long time. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. ","That\u2019s the focus, because we can\u2019t predict the future anymore than anyone else can. All we can do is be as nimble and responsive as possible. And I think we are well positioned to do that. So thanks. ","Craig Kennison ","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Billy Kovanis","Hi, this is Billy Kovanis for Adam Jonas. A question on HDFS. In the quarter, it looked it B2 motorcycle operating margins was offset by HDFS, with HDFS margins down year-over-year despite pretty supportive credit conditions? ","What management changes aside and accounting changes aside? Could you please comment on how HDFS may have been impacted by assets on new riders? Is it reasonable to assume as a slight sacrifice in credit quality in HDFS in order to drive some revenue growth? Thanks. ","John Olin ","I am sorry. My mike was off. So, when we talk about the quality of the company\u2019s portfolio, Billy, is we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with where the portfolio is. We\u2019ve got a very strong portfolio and it\u2019s performing very well aside from the LMS issues that we\u2019ve talked about. And I think when you talk about credit quality, what you are referring to, I would assume is a subprime as a percentage of the total. ","And we\u2019ve been in a range of 15% to 20% of our loans are subprime. And this year, we are seeing subprime up a little bit on a year-over-year basis still and well within that range and I guess, actually in 2018, we saw subprime down about the same amount. So it kind of goes up and down. But I would caution to equate that subprime is a bad thing. ","As a matter of fact, subprime is a very good thing. It does push up some of the credit losses and credit metrics and delinquencies. But that is a shift in mix. When we look at subprime, those loans have a tremendously high return on equity or very profitable and they also come with, in most cases, an incremental motorcycle sale. ","Because there is no other lender of subprime motorcycle customers in the United States. And so, we are very judicious about it and we have been keeping again in that 15% to 20% channel. But the answer to your question, we couldn\u2019t feel better about the loan portfolio that we have aside from the issues that kind of the ripple effect to the LMS. ","Billy Kovanis","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Tim Conder ","Thank you. And John, I would like to just follow-up on that question a little bit. We do get a lot of questions related to the HDFS. So, I guess, another way to ask it is, are you seeing the trends in the credit metrics, if you split prime and subprime and you talk about the mix, but as far as the actual credit losses, how are those trending? ","Or would you all be looking in the future to maybe kind of break the disclosures of those losses out between prime and subprime? Just any color if you could give us there",". And then, the other follow-up would be the third quarter retail cadence in the U.S. in particular, just to clarify, was July \u2013 did those benefit from the promotions I think that were done by yourselves and the industry and then how did August and September look year-over-year relative to the month of July year-over-year? Thank you. ","John Olin ","Thanks, Tim. With regards to the splits between prime and subprime and you look at the higher credit losses that we have at higher delinquencies, I think you might find it little counterintuitive is, this year, we are seeing a larger increase in prime or a denigration in prime that we are subprime. And again, the LMS system is driving that. ","But we keep a close eye on \u2013 of those that are very segmented to us and we use different drivers to improve them. But again, overall, the metrics that we are seeing are driven by the LMS. Prime is a little bit worse than subprime and we are working with that and expect also that to drop off by the fourth quarter. ","Your next question, Tim, was with regards to the sales cadence within the third quarter. I think to understand the sales cadence of the third quarter is really to look at what happened in the third quarter of 2018 and it\u2019s really the mere opposite of it. ","But as we walk through it in the month of July, retail sales were up in the United States in the low-single-digits. In August, they were down in the mid-single-digits and in September, they were down in the mid to upper-single-digits. ","With regards to the promotional activity in July, we had very little promotional activity in 2019 in the month of July. We had very little promotional activity in the third quarter, net effect the biggest thing that we did in terms of sales incentive in the third quarter was a two week finance offer in September, net compared to the year ago period of a six week finance offer across Touring and Softail. ","This year, we did two weeks on just Touring and we did that again, get people to come into the dealerships with the arrivals of the new model year motorcycles, as well as help our dealers with carryover inventory. And as I have mentioned, carryover inventory is in very good shape. It\u2019s the best that it\u2019s been in many years. ","But also looking to help the dealers because there is very little price increase on a year-over-year basis that help them move out some of the excess carryover. ","Tim Conder ","Great. Thank you. Very helpful. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open. ","Joseph Spak ","Thanks, good morning. John, just maybe a clarification, because, on the second quarter call, you talked about the incremental tariff headwind for this year being lower to $100 million. Now it seems like you are saying, it\u2019s actually $80 million with the incremental $40 million. ","And then, we look at sort of what was already done year-to-date. The gross margin guidance is always sort of just down year-over-year and that remains, but it also seems like that\u2019s lower, you have some savings progress. So, is there another change we should think about in the gross margin? ","John Olin ","I am not completely tracking with you, Joe. In the second quarter, we are expecting approximately $100 million of tariffs this year that wasn\u2019t an incremental year-over-year, that\u2019s what we were expecting this year. We did incur some tariffs in 2018. So the incremental piece is lower than $100 million. ","We\u2019ve increased that from a $100 million to $105 million and then we talked about what\u2019s going to happen in 2019 \u2013 I am sorry, in 2020. EU tariffs will start to fall off in the second quarter. China tariffs will fall off at the beginning of the year and the 301s are going to be with us until we can mitigate those. If you can give me a little bit more, I can help out, but that\u2019s\u2026","Joseph Spak ","Yes, no, maybe it\u2019s just sort of bad or a misspeak. But if I go back to the second quarter transcript, the tariffs you talked about on an incremental basis being $100 million. So your answer sort of clarified that. Maybe in lieu of that if I could just ask just one on HDFS. ","I guess, just maybe you could just give us some color about how you think about the return on some of the actions you are taken the issue of as holistically, because I know it\u2019s sort of not a perfect metric here, but if you look at sort of what\u2019s happened to HDFS income plus motorcycle gross profit, that is sort of still down. ","So, I mean, how do you think about the incremental return from using HDFS a little bit more to stimulate sales? ","John Olin ","Yes, I think if you go back and look at overall margins, going back several years ago, they were higher. And I believe they are higher for all financial service companies and the reason being is that, coming out of the downturn, we saw customers are really focused on repairing their credit. In addition and a bigger driver was that we have all the recoveries. ","Once we write-off alone, we never stop going after recovering it and so out of the downturn for several years after that, there was a lot of recoveries coming in and credit loan losses were at historically low levels and they have risen since then, one, because consumer behavior is changing and two is, just because they were at such a low level to begin with. ","So, we have seen overall operating margins on fall. We've also seen on the cost of debt going up. It was very low last three or four years ago and it\u2019s starting to rise a little bit. But when we look at the returns, which we measure ourselves on return on equity of HDFS, and Joe, it\u2019s never been higher. It\u2019s at 22% last year and that is an absolutely extraordinary return on equity for any financial service firms. ","Banking is a - good return is a little bit over 10. So, we are in a class of our own in terms of the returns that we are delivering from HDFS and couldn\u2019t be prouder in what that organization has done and the power of the brand to deliver those returns. ","Joseph Spak ","Thank you. ","Operator","And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Shannon Burns for some concluding remarks. ","Shannon Burns","All right. Thanks, everyone.

Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Amy, and good day, everyone. Last quarter, I talked about my confidence in the strength of the business, our strategies and our team. Today, despite some disappointing results, but thanks to a lot of great strategy and planning work we've done over the last several months, I'm even more confident we have the foundation, plan and team in place to compete to win and lead in the marketplace.","I'll talk more about our forward view and actions in a minute, but first I want to share some perspectives on our quarter and year so far. You've read the results in this morning's press release, and it goes without saying the quarter and the year-to-date did not unfold the way we expected. The marketplace has thrown us some curve balls this year and competition has ramped up, whether it's a currency-driven advantage for competitors in the U.S. or new products from competitors in EMEA.","We've also had some headwinds of our own making such as product availability and voluntary recalls. We fully recognize we have to raise our game. We challenged our playbook, acted to drive demand, reallocated spending and fast-tracked initiatives.","Some of our actions, like the U.S. Military Learn to Ride initiative, and the rollout of our new 2016 models, hit the mark and stimulated demand. Some of our actions did less than we expected, but the bottom line on Q3 is our performance did not meet our expectations. We know we can do better and we will.","Moving forward, we're taking what we've learned and are applying it. We continue to refine our investments and sharpen our resolve. And that's why I'm more confident now than ever in our ability to compete and win. Part of this confidence comes from the nature of the successes we did see, and part of it rests on the incredible foundation already in place and our plans to take it to the next level. In short, we're going to dial things up.","As you know six years ago, we introduced our plan to grow our reach and impact with more customers globally. To do so, we committed to do what it took to be great at our core work of product development, manufacturing and retail. Today, much of that work is complete with fine-tuning ongoing.","We have incredible strengths that we can leverage and maximize. We know how to develop great customer-led products and get them to market in world-class time, and we will do even more in this area. We know how to manufacture to effectively meet dynamic global customer demand. We know what customers expect at retail, and our industry-leading dealers are equipped to provide best-in-class customer experiences. We have a tremendous brand that ignites passion in every one of our customers. And most importantly, we've proven that our strong appeal with U.S. core customers extends to every one of our U.S. outreach segments and to our international customers in both developed and emerging markets.","As we look to the future, our plan to grow our reach and impact with customers globally has not changed. And at their core, our focus areas I'll be talking about today are natural extension of the strong foundations we have in place. So let's talk about our path ahead.","We've got five clear objectives. One, lead in every market. This means achieving and holding the number one share of the 601 cc motorcycle segment. This is not just about competing, but winning. This is the objective we're all most energized by.","Two, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of U.S. core customers and growing U.S. outreach customers at a faster rate. We're already making great progress in this area as we have more than doubled the rate of growth in sales to outreach customers versus sales to core customers in each of the last four years, and are on track to do so this year as well.","Three, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate. We have a target to grow the international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Four, grow revenue and grow earnings faster than revenue through 2020. And finally, outperform the S&P 500.","So, those are the objectives. Now let's talk about how we plan to achieve them in a market environment we expect will continue to be highly competitive. A minute ago, I talked about dialing things up. But I don't mean just for a quarter or a year. Now is the time for incremental investment to drive demand. For 2016 and beyond, we've challenged ourselves to reallocate existing spending into demand-driving investments in both customer-facing marketing and new product development.","In 2016, we'll increase our investment in customer-facing marketing by approximately 65% above 2015 levels. We also plan to increase our investment in new product development by approximately 35% from 2015 levels. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our commitment to new products, we had already substantially increased our investment this year in new product development, which means that our planned investment for 2016 in the next several years would be nearly twice what it was in just 2014.","In dollar terms, these investments and product development and marketing represent an approximate $70 million increase in our investment to drive demand compared to 2015. Our investments will be focused in four key areas. First, increasing product and brand awareness. Second, growing new ridership in the United States. Third, increasing and enhancing brand access. And finally, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products.","Now let's talk about each one in turn, starting with product and brand awareness. We've got fantastic industry-leading products and there's more to come. We can do more to let people know about them whether it's with people who aspire to take up riding, riders of competitive brands or existing customers who could trade up to a new Harley-Davidson model that has even more of the latest features and technology.","Next, grow new ridership in the United States. We know the importance of bringing new riders into the brand and into the sport of motorcycling. One of the key ways to grow ridership is to make it easier for people to learn to ride. We've already seen great success with our Harley-Davidson Riding Academy, training more than 220,000 riders worldwide since 2010. With the rebranding of our program, and the opportunity to learn to ride on a Harley-Davidson Street 500, along with the launch of the U.S. Military Rider Training initiative, we've grown our rider training by 25% over 2014. We've created a pipeline to riding and we're going to do even more by expanding on our successful programs. We're set to more than double the numbers of riders trained annually through the Riding Academy to over 100,000 globally by 2020 with the majority in the United States.","The third area focus is to increase and enhance brand access, increasing customer touch points with Harley-Davidson. First and foremost, this is about continuing to expand and enhance our incredibly strong global dealer network, which provides one of the greatest competitive differentiators for our brand through the service and experiences they deliver. As I shared, we have a target to grow our international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Beyond traditional dealerships, we're developing new retail formats for urban centers and urban tastes. eCommerce expansion is also key.","Currently, Harley-Davidson products are available via eCommerce in the U.S., India, and China, but look for more markets to come. Importantly, we'll also accelerate the cadence and impact of new products and extend our leadership in the features and technologies that matter to customers; things like linked brakes, engine performance and environmental enhancements, aerodynamics and electric vehicle technology. Project Rushmore bikes and Project LiveWire are great early examples of our capability and resolve to deliver technology and innovation to inspire our riders.","I won't go into details about what's coming down the pipeline, but there will be a steady drumbeat ranging from product updates and refreshes to new products and meaningful technology including new engines and all-new motorcycles from the ground up too.","So, there you have it. We're committed to dialing up our strengths in growing Harley-Davidson by increasing our reach and impact. All of this will require smart and strong plans, agility, accountability, and commitment from our entire team. We're ready, and we're committed. And we know, as we showed with manufacturing and product development, that when we're all committed we do amazing things.","I want to be crystal clear. The path forward will play out over a number of years. This isn't about improving results for a quarter or even a year. This is about where we want to be in 3 years, 5 years, and even 10 years. We'll continue to build on our plans, adapt, and adjust as we need to.","So, as I wrap up my comments, I hope you've noticed the common theme, market leadership. The path we're on is all about asserting our already substantial leadership in the industry and continuing to drive sustainable growth well into the future. We're going to lead and compete with clear purpose and intent. We're going to lead boldly and unapologetically. We're not just going to compete. We're here to win.","With that, I'll turn it over to John. John?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our third quarter financial results starts on slide 14.","During the quarter, revenue was $1.32 billion, net income was $140.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69, all achieved in an incredibly challenging environment. Operating income for the motorcycle segment was down 2.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Motorcycle segment gross margin continued to be very strong despite unfavorable currency impact. The motorcycle business operating margin percent was down slightly driven by lower gross margin and slightly higher SG&A spending. At HDFS, operating income was down 6.4% year-over-year.","The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense resulting from our recent recapitalization plan. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term.","Now, let's look at retail sales on slide 15. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the third quarter. Retail sales were below our expectations, and as a result, we are adjusting our full year shipment guidance down by 11,000 motorcycles. We now expect to ship between 265,000 and 270,000 motorcycles, approximately flat to down 2% versus prior year. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to manage supply in line with demand and protect our brand premium.","Looking forward, we expect to return to growth as we benefit from our new 2016 model year motorcycles, increased investment in demand-driving actions, improved product availability and the overall strength of the Harley-Davidson brand.","Turning to the U.S., on slide 16, third quarter retail sales were down 2.5% adversely impacted by continued intense competitive activity, lapping the enthusiastic Rushmore response, and limited availability on certain models. These significant challenges were partially offset by our market response actions initiated in the second quarter. While we believe these actions were effective, they were not sufficient given the headwinds we face in the U.S.","During the quarter, the U.S. industry grew 4.5%. We had a very strong market leadership share position of 52.4%, and we believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter is a sign of industry strength going forward. However, our Q3 market share was down 3.9 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last four quarters was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers.","Dealers' retail inventories were consistently below prior year levels throughout the quarter, which adversely affected product availability on certain models. Inventories recovered by quarter end and finished the quarter up slightly to prior year. We continue to expect year-end retail inventories to be flat slightly to up slightly compared to last year, reflecting the incremental new models launched in the 2016 model year.","On slide 17, retail sales in our international markets were up 0.9% in the third quarter. In the EMEA region, retail sales were up despite the impact of new models introduced by competitive brands and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in non-local currencies. Year-to-date, Europe market share was down 1.6 percentage points behind the impact of new low-priced models in the performance and standard segments, market segments where we do not compete.","In the Asia-Pacific region, emerging markets continue to experience growth. However, retail sales in the region were negatively impacted as a result of very limited availability of Street motorcycles in August and early September following a voluntary recall initiated in July. The supply of Street motorcycles was largely restored by the end of the quarter.","Latin America region retail sales were down in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil behind a weak economy, consumer uncertainty, and aggressive price competition. Brazil declines were partially offset by strong growth in Mexico.","Finally, retail sales in Canada were down modestly in a highly competitive environment. We believe the market responded well to the change to a direct distribution model, which took effect at the beginning of August and to a reduction in pricing with model year 2016 motorcycles.","Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by expanding our distribution network, building on our brand experience across the world, and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders.","On slide 18, wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were up 5.5% compared to last year but slightly below our expected range of 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles in response to the lower than expected retail sales during the quarter. The overall shipment mix reflects a significantly higher percent of Cruiser shipments behind our model year 2016 product investments.","On slide 19, revenue for the motorcycles segment was up in Q3 compared to last year driven by a 5.5% higher motorcycle shipments partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange, which reduced revenue by approximately 5.2% in unfavorable mix.","During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $899 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Motorcycle and MSRP prices for our new 2016 model year motorcycles have increased by an average of about 1%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of cost is up about 0.5% expressed as a percent of revenue.","Parts and accessory revenue grew 5.2% behind strong new product sales, while general merchandise revenue was down slightly. Both P&A and general merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.","On slide 20, gross margin in the quarter was 34.6%, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin was very strong during the quarter when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange, which was $29.9 million unfavorable for the third quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies, which devalued an average of 18% compared to the prior year.","While manufacturing was unfavorable during the quarter, year-to-date manufacturing was favorable by $7.4 million behind strong productivity gains, partially offset by lower year-over-year production. Our gross margin performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability.","On slide 21, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 12.5%, down 0.4 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to the consolidation of Canada into our operations, partially offset by other favorabilities. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on an operating investment profile that will drive top-line growth. Coupled with a continuous improvement mindset, we will drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","Now, let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on slide 22. During the quarter, HDFS operating profit decreased 6.4% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the recent low-rate promotional activity. The provision for retail loan losses was unfavorable to prior year due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in receivables.","HDFS' third quarter operations are summarized on slide 23. HDFS' retail loan originations increased 14.3% compared to last year's third quarter, primarily driven by a 9.6 percentage point increase in our U.S. market share and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. The strong market share performance was driven by the third quarter promotional offers.","On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company.","At the end of the quarter, we had $405 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had nearly $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.","On slide 24, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 3.16% or 16 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels. Annualized retail credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.19% compared to last year's third quarter driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime origination in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior.","During the third quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on slide 25. I would like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $1.02 billion in the first nine months of this year. Operating cash was up $54.1 million from last year driven by lower wholesale lending and lower working capital, partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","Now, switching our focus to shareholder value on slide 26. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share. In addition, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $536 million. During the third quarter, we also began to execute our recapitalization plan. Details of the plan are on slide 27.","We successfully borrowed $750 million in a combination of both 10-year and 30-year notes. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.","Before I update our 2015 guidance on slide 28, I want to discuss changes that we will make to the company's motorcycle operating investment profile in 2016 as it will have an impact on our Q4 and full-year 2015 results. As Matt discussed, in 2016, we will significantly increase our investment to drive demand. We will source the funds by reallocating from our existing spending primarily from support functions and through reorganization of our commercial operations aimed at being both leaner and stronger.","And again, we expect to increase our investment in customer-facing marketing activities by approximately 65% from 2015 levels. We also expect to increase our investment in new product development by 35% from 2015 levels.","As we prepare the organization for this new operating investment profile, we expect to incur one-time expenses in Q4 of 2015 of approximately $30 million to $45 (sic) $35 million. These one-time expenses will largely consist of employee separation and reorganization cost. We expect the significant change will address the current competitive environment, and will accelerate top line growth over the next several years.","Now, let's talk about guidance for the full year. For the full year 2015, we now expect to ship 265,000 to 270,000 motorcycles, which is approximately flat to down 2% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship 47,000 to 52,000 motorcycles, which is approximately flat to up 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter.","For 2015, we now believe operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 16% and 17% compared to 18.0% in 2014. Our lower operating margin expectations are due to lower shipment expectations, one-time charges we expect in Q4, and increased recall expenses during the third quarter.","In 2015, we continue to expect gross margin will be up modestly compared to 2014, impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect a favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and increased pension expense.","To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 0.75 percentage points.","As we look forward to 2016, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates through 2016, recognizing this is a hypothetical expectation and in a very volatile exchange rate environment, we would expect approximately $45 million of additional unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact to gross margin as we lap the hedge benefits that we expect to realize in 2015.","Looking at SG&A, excluding one-time charges we expect in Q4, we expect SG&A to be up in 2015 compared to last year. This includes the impact from the Canadian distributor transaction which occurred on August 4, 2015. The incremental SG&A impact of the Canadian transaction was approximately $10 million of increased expense in Q3. In Q4, we also expect approximately $10 million of SG&A expense related to Canadian operations. Our guidance for HDFS and CapEx remain unchanged. We now expect full year tax rate to be approximately 35% versus previously expected 35.5%.","So, that's the quarter. And while the results have fallen short of our expectations, we maintained a strong gross margin percent and delivered shareholder value through a $0.31 per share dividend and $536 million in share repurchases. But what's most important is what lies ahead. As Matt shared, we have a clear path forward and are making the investments we believe are necessary to drive demand and grow our business and achieve our goals.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson.","With that, we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Milota from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kevin M. Milota - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Appreciate the time here. Question on market share losses in the quarter. Obviously, the competitive environment is pretty clear to all of us, but you called out the new product introductions by competitors. I was hoping you could give some color on where specifically you're seeing the increased kind of competition from either new competitive supply or the competition in EMEA?","And then secondly, with the model year 2016 bikes, how do you think those bikes are being perceived by both customers and dealers? How does that play into this market share theme as well? Thank you.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great, Kevin. This is John. In terms of market share in the United States, we were down 3.9%, pretty much in line with what we've seen over the last four quarters. And again, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw world currency shift and an incredible increase in overall competitive discounting. So, that's a big portion of the 3.9 points of share loss.","In addition, we've seen more competition in terms of new product. And also, probably the biggest driver of share loss in the quarter was from a new product called autocycles. That's included in the MIC numbers. And we do not believe that they compete head-to-head with motorcycles. It's a very different product. It's much more car-like. It has side-by-side seating, a gas pedal and steering wheel, but it is classified in the MIC numbers.","So, the biggest piece of that share loss is coming from the inclusion of autocycles in overall market share. The thing that we're most excited about is next quarter. In the fourth quarter, we start to lap the beginning of softness due to the competitive discounting. And so, we'll have a little bit easier comps as we move into the fourth quarter and throughout next year.","In terms of EMEA, it's been a highly competitive market there as well. That has not been driven by price competition as much as it has been in the U.S. In EMEA, it's really driven by a couple new products. They are what we would call a middle-weight displacement in the 700 cc and 900 cc category and they're in the performance and standard segments.","We compete in cruisers and \u2013 but these products have had a tremendous impact on the market. They've been very well received and actually driving the year-to-date growth in the European market up 10%. And so, first couple of quarters hit us pretty hard with regards to market share loss in Europe. Much better in the third quarter, retail sales turned positive 2.4%.","The European team is doing a great job that came out with a couple of significant promotions. Custom Kings, which is a competition of personalizing and customizing our Street motorcycles as well as king of demos (31:23) and they've done a magnificent job in turning that around and very pleased what we are seeing in the third quarter there.","And the last question that you asked, Kevin, is with regards to model year 2016 motorcycles. We feel very good about the model year 2016 launch, and so do our dealers, a lot of times people compare everything going back to Rushmore. Rushmore was an incredible year for us and that about 50% of our volume and half our models were redone. And we're going to see those from time to time, but they're not going to be every year.","And with that, our model year 2016 was focused on our Cruiser bikes. And we added a tremendous amount of power to those bikes by adding our High Output 103 engine. We added cruise control to Softails. And in addition, we added or significantly improved five models. There was two S models, which include a 110 engine and they have sold extremely well, as well as a new Road Glide Ultra and two refreshes of our most popular Sportsters in Iron 883 and Forty-Eight.","As you look at the quarter, we were very light on supply. Our supply could not meet the demand of those five models. We ended the quarter with about one bike per dealer in the U.S. in inventory. So, still very light as we exited the quarter on inventory for those five models. And that will be replenished in the fourth quarter.","Kevin M. Milota - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very good. I appreciate the details. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on the easier compares from the promotional environment. So fourth quarter, it gets a little bit easier. When do we start to see kind of the really easier comparisons? Would that be by second quarter of 2016 versus second quarter of 2015? When do those compares get easier?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Greg. The full brunt of the discounting was really in the first quarter. We saw \u2013 it started up in the fourth quarter and had certainly soft market share and that was the competitive discounting and some new competitive entrants in the fourth quarter of last year. But really when you look at the full fury of the price discounting, it was in the first quarter. By and large, it got a little bit stiffer in the second quarter, but we would look to the first quarter as being that mark you're talking about.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Yeah. All right. Good. And then, just with respect to your investments in consumer-facing marketing by 65% and then product development by 35%. So, I'm assuming that the product development probably doesn't start benefiting you for, probably it's not 2016, but it's more 2017, 2018, 2019 given the lead times. And then \u2013 but the marketing would probably benefit sales immediately. Am I thinking that the right way?","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Matt. You are. Product development, and as I mentioned in my comments, we started to increase the investment. In fact, in 2015 it will go even higher again, another 35% in 2016. And the lead time, I'm getting products to market, is a factor and when you'll see the benefit of that. But as we've discussed many times, we're focused on really reading what our customer is looking for from Harley-Davidson, making smart decisions about the products that are going to drive demand and getting into market in world-class time. And that is embedded now in our product development capability set. So, you won't have to wait years and years for that stuff to start seeing the market.","And with respect to the marketing investment, our focus on that is that it is discretionary dollars, if you will not embedded in people, so that we have the flexibility to invest that money within the year and across years in the most effective manner to drive the most effective growth, so thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is, what is your outlook for year-end inventory in the U.S. and internationally?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Craig. This is John. With regards to the year-end inventory, we are looking at inventories in the U.S. being up slightly and that would be solely driven by the new models that we added in our model year 2016 lineup. There was three incremental models and the two S models and Road Glide. So, slight increase in U.S., year-end inventory driven by that. Internationally, we expect inventories to be up slightly versus year ago as well, and that's just based on the growth projections that we have into 2016.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And second question. With respect to your plan to spend an incremental $70 million, I'm trying to get a feel for whether you have offsets in the model. In other words, when we look at 2016, you think we'll be closer to the 18% to 19% operating margin you had previously targeted or closer to the 16% to 17% that you're experiencing this year?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, when we look at the overall drop in operating margin of 2 percentage points, right, we were at 18% to 19% and we're dropped at 16% to 17%, and there's a couple of drivers of that. And one is the absorption on 11,000 units, which certainly affects our gross margin. Having said that, Craig, our gross margin, we still expect to be up on a year-over-year basis. And I can't stress enough how important that is and how powerful the margin structure is at Harley-Davidson.","So, you look at gross margin, we're going to have well over $100 million hit in currency, which is three-quarters of a percentage point. We're going to have unfavorable mix as we invest in an incredibly powerful product such as Street. And we've also \u2013 we'll have lower year-over-year production, and therefore, a headwind on production and yet still our gross margin is going to grow in 2015. And that's driven by the ability to price our products and incredible productivities that we're driving out of the plants. So, that will stay with us in 2015 and 2016 as we go forward.","Also affecting operating margin this year is higher non-repeating SG&A expenses. So, what we've got is three SG&A expenses that are affecting our overall guidance for the remainder of this year. One is the one-time expenses of $30 million to $35 million. And this is money spent already as for that new investment profile to significantly increase our investment and demand-driving activities into 2016 and beyond. The second is incorporation of Canada in the guidance. Remember, we didn't have that in our guidance after the second quarter. And we talked about that being $0.04 dilutive. Well, that's all coming in the form of higher SG&A as we transition that business and size it appropriately size it to gain the synergies out of us managing that market. And then the third piece of it is certainly unanticipated recall expense of $15 million in the third quarter.","So, you take the lower absorption and the SG&A, that's what's driving our gross margins to be down. So, to answer your question, Craig, is the gross margin is incredibly strong and powerful, and that will continue to move into next year. We will have some headwinds on currency in 2016. But overall, very strong gross margin. And these things that we're talking about affecting operating margin are all non-repeating items.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. Matt, we didn't hear a lot about resources being earmarked to fix quality. The parade recalls you've been having is limited availability, costs you money, and perhaps sending some customers over to India. So how do you plan to fix quality? And then, second, maybe you can just tell us how much we spent so far this year on recalls.","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. Gerrick. So, there is a tremendous amount of effort going on throughout the entire make side of the business: manufacturing, development and supply management. And, in fact, this intensity got dialed up when we had our first Rushmore-related recall here shortly after launch. So there's nothing from a cost perspective that you're seeing related to those changes, but they are significant.","I would say that in my time here, we've never had a more significant view on all the things we need to do to assure quality. We enjoy incredible loyalty and incredible trust on the part of our riders. We will do nothing to violate that. It's incredibly valuable to us, and these recalls have been very disappointing to the company and to our riders and to our dealers. There's no question about it.","I will say that there's nothing more important than the safety of our riders. They are not sitting in cars with seatbelts and airbags and sheet metal around them. We understand immediately any safety implications that might exist with the quality problem. We get on it as quickly as we can. And we act decisively in the interest of the safety of our riders. And meanwhile, we're doing everything that we know and we're bringing all sorts of outside expertise into auditing, assessing and advising us on what we need to do to get out of this state with these product quality issues that we've suffered. So, again, there's nothing that isn't in the numbers that needs to be in the numbers but there's an incredible amount of intensity going on within the business, and I think, John, you \u2013 Gerrick, asked the total number of recalls.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Gerrick, you asked about the total. It's $32 million of recall expenses in our year-to-date number.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And I was just wondering when did you guys begin constructing this new plan? It seems to come right on the heels of a brand new launch that was supposed to be a good new lineup for model year 2016. When did you sit down, say, okay, we need to do something, let's formulate a plan and let's go forward with this?","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Gerrick, this is Matt again. So, coming out of Q4 with the currency driven \u2013 this currency-enabled discounting and into Q1, and we started to see the impact on our business. And I'll tell you that, from my perspective, we've had a longstanding commitment and it remains to manage supply in line with demand. That is to preserve the premium nature of the brand in the marketplace, and that is absolutely critical to us. However, it becomes \u2013 I guess, the first quarter, in particular, started really resonate with me from a standpoint of \u2013 that's we're only talking about half the side of that equation and what do we need to do as a business to drive demand.","And so, beginning really in Q2, we took action. We had a lot of early plans. We were a little bit behind the seasonality curve at that point in time. So it didn't have the effect that we expected and we're driving four for this year. But as I said in my opening remarks, it taught us a lot about what works, what doesn't work, and where we need to apply ourselves with more focus and more intensity, to drive demand in a quality way globally for the long term. So, that's what we're about and that's what we've been working on really through Q2 and in earnest in Q3, and we will carry forward through Q4 with the restructuring to get ourselves fully set up to start really delivering in 2016.","And I would say that from my perspective this is a pivotal moment for the company. We've been talking for six years about transformation and we're pivoting from transformation to driving demand and that's Harley-Davidson at this point in time in the midst of that pivot. So, thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I had a quick follow-up on Craig's question then I had another question. But I think Craig asked about the $70 million spend for next year, and should we be netting some or all of that out, It sounds like you're making some lay-offs. I'm assuming that's a gross number. Should we be netting a significant amount out of that or should we be adding $70 million to our OpEx assumptions for next year?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, James. So, to be crystal clear, we are sourcing the $70 million. The $70 million is completely incremental to our marketing and our new product development spending. We are sourcing that from our existing SG&A spending, and largely in areas of the corporate support functions, as well as a complete reorganization of our commercial side of the business, to structure it, to be much more focused, leaner, and direct with our ability to spend the $70 million in the most impactful way. So, we are not expecting overall SG&A to go up as a result of our increased investment to drive demand of the $70 million.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then maybe you could just take us back a few months ago. I think a lot of people were doing the math heading into the second quarter and sort of assumed that you'd lower the guide. Then you kept the guide unchanged, which really implied an acceleration in the second half, which really left The Street thinking that maybe you knew something about the makeup of the second half that we didn't.","What were you seeing back then that made you feel like things were going to get a lot better in the second half? Obviously, they got worse. But, I guess, another way to look at that, I mean, June, end of June, I think you talked about being really strong. Did numbers fall off a cliff from there or was it a slow sort of straight line between high-single digits and a decline for the quarter?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right. No. Thanks, James. So we had talked about \u2013 we started to get money out in the market in mid-May to the mid-June timeframe, if you recall, and we had a three-pronged approach to doing that. And we saw very good results in the month of June. Month of June was up near double digit both in the international markets as well as in the United States. And that momentum continued into July. Matter of fact, in July, we were ahead of our plan, my retail plan in July, and the growth continued into the first half of August, started to get softer in the back half of August, and September was down.","And so things were going according to plan until about halfway through the quarter, and they turned a little bit negative. And again, the spending that we did was effective but certainly not sufficient given the headwinds that we faced. The comps also progressively got worse through the quarter as well. And then we had some issues with availability in United States and certainly in our Asia Pacific markets with inventories being down.","When you looked at the U.S. inventory, while it finished up a little bit on a year-over-year basis, for 12 of the 13 weeks, it was down quite a bit and a lot of that time up to down 10%. So that put some pressure on in the United States and certainly with the new products that we came out with for those five models, the demand outstripped our ability to supply those. And again, still a little bit light on those inventories, as we move in to the fourth quarter.","And in addition, the recalls that we had, we had two recalls in the middle of the quarter, and they had an impact on some of our parts, in particular, on our Street motorcycles, the fuel pump, we couldn't produce them fast enough. And we essentially \u2013 dealers weren't selling Street motorcycles for up to six weeks during the third quarter. The biggest impact of that was in Asia Pacific. Even though Asia Pacific was still up, it was certainly hindered by lack of selling Street motorcycles for a period of that time. Inventories are back with regards the Street and looking forward to a better fourth quarter.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. So, a few follow-up questions on the marketing plan. I guess, could we get some more granularity on what you think worked and what didn't work over the summer from a marketing standpoint? And then, do you have any kind of examples in the past where Harley has really kicked up the marketing and you've seen the results coming through? And then, lastly, growing the addressable motorcycle base, it seems a little bit like rolling a boulder uphill, and most of the folks we talk to, they get interested in Harley because their friends are interested in Harley. So, how easy is that? I mean, how are you going to get to that kind of higher cadence of folks going through the motorcycle academy?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Sharon. I can't remember the first question. Let's start with the third question, how are we going to take the $70 million or the 65% increase in customer-facing marketing and drive demand, part of it is through awareness. And you're absolutely right, Sharon, as a lot of this is through the brotherhood of riding and so on and so forth. But the fact of the matter is our share of voice has never been close to our share of market and that's one of the benefits that we get of having one of the world's most powerful brands. However, in the last couple of years, we have seen an incredible amount of marketing dollars coming in into the market and it's been diluting our share of voice a bit. Just take the discounting for example. I mean the tens and tens of millions of dollars of discounts are all being advertised throughout the United States, and so we've lost a little bit on share of voice as well as the new products.","So, we are going to get that share of voice back, and yes, we got tremendous things to talk about in terms of our new products and the products, and the experiences that we offer, and we have fallen a little bit behind on that in terms of us being front and center. In terms of growing the ridership in the United States, I'm actually getting back to your first question, what's worked very well is things like the Military Rider Academy or free rider training. The response has been way in excess of our expectations. We've now got a quarter behind us on this and we're getting thousands of people through the Rider Academy program and we're starting to see the fruits of that pay off in a conversion rate which is better than what we would typically see with the military going through and ultimately buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. So what's better than that, that somebody that's never ridden, we're bringing them into the sport of motorcycling and getting them on a Harley-Davidson. So those types of things are what we're going to do a lot more of next year, and you're going to see a lot more of that type of investment.","And we'd look at things that maybe didn't go as well. I wouldn't say it's go as well, but they were much more short term in nature, for example, the financing. The financing drove incremental sales in the beginning of the quarter and we expected that and it did that. However, there is certainly diminishing returns on that type of investment and we never intended that to go into our model year 2016 motorcycles. And so, the financing ended with the new model year. And again, that's not the way to build into the future is training customers for discounts. But it does \u2013 it is an important tool and it provided an opportunity for us to clear out some of the model year 2015s. So we've learned from all of those things. We're going to do a lot more of the things that work next year, and we're going to bring, more importantly, a tremendous amount of more resources to do that. And we're also organizing our company to be much more demand-focused in how we go to market with our dealers and our customers.","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, this is Matt. Sharon, I'd just add the comment about that we have examples of this in the past, not to this degree. So we have \u2013 this is a significant shift for the company as I indicated. We're dialing things up. We're dialing things up in the area, in principle, to compete more effectively in the marketplaces around the world. So we learned a lot this summer. We're going to continue to learn things. We're going to get some things wrong. We're going to have to continue to dial things in. But you can't do what we're talking about doing without putting dollars on the table and smart investments into the marketplace that drive sustainable, profitable, brand-enhancing growth for the company. And that's why in my comments I indicated that you're not going to see necessarily a pop in the next quarter or even next year. Some of this stuff is planting seeds for the long term. And just to add to John's point, getting people in the United States continue to be interested and passionate about motorcycling. As a leader in the marketplace in the United States, as a significant leader that we have been for decades, we need to play more of a role than we have historically in that and we're putting money on the table to do that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching the end of our call. In order to provide more time for others to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. I don't want to beat a dead horse on the market share thing. But one of the things that surprised us was not necessarily the share performance. I mean, as you mentioned yourself, right, year-on-year, the share decline has been somewhat sort of similar for the last three quarters, which one would expect, right, unless the conditions, competitive conditions have changed.","But the definition of the market declined, right, from up 9% in Q1 to up 6% I think and then up 4%, and that was also another potential headwind there. And I just wanted to ask you, is there something you're seeing that's kind of starting to weigh on the growth of the market itself?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is John. I don't think so. So, you're absolutely right, Pat. First quarter we're up 9%, I think the industry was up 7% in the second quarter, and this quarter 4.5%. I think you're starting to just see some of the pull forward of the discounting that was done in the first quarter and probably should be looking more in an aggregate on a year-to-date basis. The overall market is up 6.6%, which certainly we're very pleased with, a lot of new people coming in to motorcycling in general. I don't \u2013 I just think you're seeing some of the initial impact of those tremendous discounts and some volumes pull forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Matt, you gave a number of examples of enhancements you're planning to make to your product line to be more attractive to customers, but that's going to take some time. So I'm wondering, do you think you can grow \u2013 when we think about next year, do you think you can grow unit shipments next year?","And, John, I need to ask this question for you. You talked about how your financing drove retail sales in the quarter, and then you didn't apply that to the 2016 model year, which is understandable. Just, can you help us understand how much of the financing promotions drove the retail sales in the quarter? Thank you.","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Felicia. I'll just comment quick on product development. This is not new thinking, right? There's new investment, but thinking around customer-led product development is embedded in the product development transformation. You started to see that with Rushmore, with things like LiveWire. Really understanding what people are looking for from Harley, what is a unique and powerful product feature or technology that matters to riders. So, these ideas are already inherent in the pipeline of new products. So, what was referenced for the investment isn't so much of a capability or impact of the product, but the capacity, the quantity, if you will, for new products that will be increasing over time.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Felicia, John. When we talk about looking forward 2016 and what we expect in terms of the delivery of the dollars and marketing and certainly the product is \u2013 number one, as we look at the \u2013 next year, much easier comps. So that starts it. But model year 2016 and 2017 is certainly going to drive volume for us. The continued rollout of Street outreach growth, through the year-to-date, outreach is up 7%. Even the overall volumes are down. We've been very successful in that avenue and continue that in 2016, and then finally, international expansion.","This quarter alone, we've put up 14 dealerships internationally, which is a 2% increase in our overall international dealerships. And as Matt mentioned upfront is we look to put up 150 to 200 new dealerships over the next five years, which represents a 20% to 25% increase in our international dealerships. So, with all of that, we expect growth in 2016. And while we don't provide our guidance until January, I think you can expect that you'll see in the neighborhood of 3% to 5% shipment growth as we look to 2016.","The next question you asked is with regards to financing. It is very difficult to pull out how much exactly is driven by the financing piece. When we initiated those projects, the successes and the take rate is very high. You can see our market share at HDFS was 70% in the quarter, certainly driven by an increased amount of financing. Difficult part is to see how much of those are incremental units. Again, at the onset, we felt it certainly drove some of the performance that we had in the first part of the quarter, but again, not the way we want to go forward as training folks to buy unfinanced (58:53) promos.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Appreciate you guys taking a little extra time here given a lot of the changes you've outlined. Couple of clarifications and then a question here. John, your FX hypothetical, assuming rates would hold, does that include the new Canadian dollar and the hedging related to that?","Definition \u2013 on autocycles, did you have any breakout as to how much that impacted your share? And then your incremental gross margin, still 47%, is that still a reasonable target at this point? Those are clarifications.","And then in the cutting of the shipments, is that largely coming out of the Cruiser, Sportster legacy products? It would seem it would be, given your comment that the new products are basically were short supply there.","A \u2013 [07N2N5-E John Olin]>: All right. Tim, I'm going to take a stab at these four questions. I'm not sure I'm going to have them all, but Amy can help. Number one is, the hypothetical would certainly include all of our currencies. And, again, this is largely the lapping of the gains that we experience next year. So, specifically, with regards to Canada, Tim, does it include it? Yes. But the hypothetical is that the rates stay exactly as they were today through the 2016.","So, we wouldn't have any impact on Canada because we didn't have Canada in the previous year and didn't have those risk exposures. But we're looking at it, that $45 million is basically the gains that we took on the financial hedges that we had this year, we will lap next year as those hedges will dissipate and go away. So, we would expect that to be the headwind that we face in terms of foreign currency for next year. But, yes, everything that we talk about at this point is inclusive of the Canadian dollar as we now are the owner of that risk.","Amy Giuffre - Director-Investor Relations","I'll follow-up on the next few, Tim. John, if you just want to get into the shipments question?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","The shipments questions are, do we expect any particular skewing of those models coming out, the answer is no. We'll be pulling them down. What you should expect to see in the fourth quarter in terms of mix is somewhat similar to what you saw in the third quarter is that the Cruiser as a percentage of our shipments will be up. We've invested a lot of money, having good success with the power that we're bringing to that line, and so, you should see that be up. You'd also should see the Street, Sportster category in segment be up. Again, we had some delays in some shipments of Street motorcycles. And so, those will be what you would expect to see up in the fourth quarter similar with what you saw this quarter and Touring down, but they're coming out of all models.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just a couple data point questions. First, is that \u2013 I think, this was just asked, is the 50% contribution margin on volume changing? Second, what was the motorcycle company operating cash flow and CapEx in the quarter? Third, can you just specifically tell us how much annual benefit you expect from the $30 million to $35 million of restructuring spend?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","The \u2013 so, we still expect, going forward, 47% incremental margin on any additional unit that we put through the company, that does not change. Our overall cost structure does not change. Again, we talked about gross margin as very strong, not a lot of overall changes to that. When we look at, Rod, I think your next question is on the one-time expenses of the $30 million to $35 million. They would all be cash expenses. There are no write-downs in that number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess I just wanted to talk about the new product initiative again and how you have confidence as you think that consumers to consistently pay for that innovation in what you, yourself are categorizing as increasingly competitive environment, and maybe tying that into \u2013 I think you made a comment about how price net of cost for 2016 would be 0.5 percentage point, which is below what it's been in the recent past. Is that the new normal level to think about what you can really get in terms of pricing for the contents you have to add?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Joe. This is John. Joe, actually, the \u2013 about 0.5 point net of price is really what we've been doing for the last several years. I think we've ranged from 0.5 point to 0.75 point. In the Rushmore year, it was 0.75 point net of cost and net revenue was up about 3.5%. But overall, we've been in the same channel of 0.5 point to 0.75 point net of cost. Joe, what was the first part of the question?","Operator","Sorry. Joe's line is already closed.","Amy Giuffre - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. We'll move on to the next question. Sorry about that, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","It's late in the call here, but I'm wondering if I could get you to just talk about the dealer network specifically here as it pertains to the plan for 2016. Are there ways to leverage your dealer network as a market research asset, I guess, that you're not pursuing now, and how specifically do you go about doing that?","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Matt. I appreciate the question. The dealer network is absolutely an integral part in every market, not just the United States. So, part of our plans and approach include how do we engage the dealer network and continue to engage quite frankly, the dealer network in the right way to identify customers, nurture, develop, serve, and support those customers.","John's comment about outreach is actually a great example of, in the U.S., the capability of the dealers growing over the last several years to understand that there's a whole world of people out there that are interested in Harley-Davidson, what we stand for as a company, how to talk to them, how to work with them, how to engage them, and continue to keep them in the family. And so, we \u2013 our dealers, as I mentioned in my comments, are second to none in the industry, just fantastic, they're committed. What more we can do with them is absolutely part of our plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neel Mehta from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning. I was just looking for an update on the Street in places like India and the Emerging Markets. Do you think we're still in the very early stages of the rollout, and are you able to put some numbers around the progress that we made in those regions?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The rollout of Street began late in the fourth quarter of last year. Remember we started out in four initial markets, late in the fourth quarter of last year in Europe and then throughout the first half of this year largely in Asia Pacific markets. And we couldn't be more pleased with the way that's going. To pick a couple examples, Street is the number one selling motorcycle in Australia, the number one selling motorcycle in India.","When you move around the globe, it's number two in Mexico. In EMEA, it's number six, most popular selling motorcycle. In United States, it's number 13. And, again, to put it in context, in the United States, there is no other Cruiser, by any competitive \u2013 any competitor out there that's selling more than Street in the United States, again, to give you an example of the size and the ability to bring new people in on that bike. So, we couldn't be more pleased with the overall rollout of Street. We do have a little bit of lapping of opportunity in the first half of next year in terms of Street growth.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. You guys have touted your flexible manufacturing as sort of a competitive advantage in the past. And I'm curious what lessons you've learned in the last quarter as demand has contracted a little bit to better position the company to stabilize those operating margins going forward?","Matthew S. Levatich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll start. John can jump in. I actually think John's comments about the performance in manufacturing are an absolute confirmation of the strength of the system that we built. We've been able to read markets, not just globally, but internal to the United States in the spring as weather unfolded differently than we expected. For example, California is an entirely different specification that we build. So, it is, in effect, feels like a different country to us from a manufacturing perspective. We're able to shift demand from the 49 states back to California specification motorcycles during the spring season when demand was far ahead of our expectations there versus the rest of the country. So, to be able to do all that and deliver these kind of gross margins in down volume years and stuff is an absolute testament to the strength of the capability.","Amy Giuffre - Director-Investor Relations","All right.

Those risks include, among others matters, we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, you'll hear from Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund. Then we'll open the call for your questions. So let's get started. Keith?","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Amy. And good morning, and thanks for joining us today as we review our 2012 results and look ahead to next year. We appreciate very much your interest in Harley-Davidson. Our entire team takes pride in what we achieved last year. We did what we set out to do: driving improvements on many fronts and growing the business and shareholder value.","EPS was up 16.7% for the full year, and new Harley-Davidson motorcycle retail sales grew 6.2% worldwide. We completed the highly successful launch of the ERP production system at our York plant, and shares of Harley-Davidson stock rose more than 25% in value during the year, once again outpacing the S&P 500.","These are just some of the latest proof points of the vast improvements of Harley-Davidson's operations and performance since embarking on our strategy of transformation in 2009. Today, Harley-Davidson is leaner, more agile and more responsive to our customers and the changing marketplace than ever before. And we continue to move aggressively to raise our performance to new levels.","All of this is only possible through the efforts and dedication of our employees, our dealers and suppliers. They are doing a truly outstanding job, and together, working as one team and moving in one direction, we are driving performance and delivering for our customers and all stakeholders.","As we enter 2013, the restructuring of our production operations is largely behind us. The rollout of the ERP system at York in the third quarter went incredibly well and is beginning to yield results. Day by day, we are improving our ability to supply dealers with the mix of motorcycles they need for their customers and in a more timely manner.","The ramp up of surge production in York has also gone well since we launched it at the start of the year. We are on target with our run rates, safety and quality, and have successfully integrated more than 400 seasonal employees to support surge at York and our Wisconsin plants, which supply York. And let me just note that we're extremely grateful to all of our full time production employees who have been welcoming and helpful to the seasonal workforce.","At Kansas City, we continued to lay the groundwork for the launch of surge production in 2014.","Turning to retail.  New Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales grew solidly in 2012, fueled by exceptional products and retail experiences. In the U.S., retail new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales grew 6.6%, market share grew 1.5 points in the U.S. heavyweight market to 57.2%. Sales to U.S. outreach customers grew faster than to core customers in 2012, and Harley-Davidson continued its market share leadership in all of our outreach demographic segments.","We also continued to grow internationally as the result of numerous improvements in our operations and distribution networks over the last few years. We opened 31 international dealerships in 18 countries in 2012, including Malaysia, Russia, Turkey and Bolivia. New Harley-Davidson motorcycle retail sales were up 39.2% in Latin America in 2012 and beat the old unit volume record set in 2008 by more than 25%. December was the best month ever for unit sales in Latin America.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 14.3% and were the highest ever for us in a number of countries, including Australia, Korea, China and India. Sales also grew in Japan, which is our largest market in the region.","And while we are pleased with our achievements in 2012 and over the last several years, more important is the road ahead. We expect to build on our strategy of bringing exceptional products to market, producing them in ways that are more responsive to the market and providing personal, customized retail experiences. Each of these things is key to delivering on our purpose as a company, which is to fulfill dreams of personal freedom for people around the world.","In 2013 and beyond, we plan to further leverage our manufacturing capabilities so that we can increasingly build the exact motorcycles our customers want and deliver them when and where they want them. And we will continue to raise the bar by bringing great motorcycles to market in a shorter amount of time. We will also build on our competitive advantage in financial services, parts and accessories, MotorClothes apparel and general merchandise.","Going forward, we will continue to refine our retail 2020 strategy, which is all about strengthening Harley-Davidson's retail support systems, dealer capabilities and distribution channels, thus providing for a personalized customer experience every time, everywhere, every day.","Through all of these efforts, we believe we are in a sound position to further expand sales with outreach and core customers in the U.S. and to continue to grow internationally.","2013 is shaping up to be another exciting year for Harley-Davidson, especially with our 110th Anniversary celebrations that are happening throughout the year, and we invite everyone to join in.","So let me wrap up by thanking you again for your interest and investment. 2012 was a watershed year for Harley-Davidson, and all of us at the company are working hard to carry this momentum forward.","Now let me turn it over to John Olin.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting with the fourth quarter on Slide 10.","During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was down 1.1% behind a 7.2% decrease in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our fourth quarter income from continuing operations improved to $70.6 million, an increase of $16 million or 29.3%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.31 per share, up 29.2% from the year ago quarter, which was $0.24 per share.","Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was $53.1 million, up 49.4% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The strong increase in Motorcycle business was driven by lower restructuring spending and a higher gross margin as compared to last year.","Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 10.9%, behind higher net interest income and improved credit loss performance. We are very pleased with the fourth quarter results and our continued progress against our goal strategies.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 11. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 7.5% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 6.2% compared to 2011. This reflects the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand and appeal of our motorcycle model years 2012 and 2013, worldwide dealer efforts and a continued investment in growth opportunities around the world.","Now let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 12.","Retail sales in the quarter were up 8.4% compared to last year's fourth quarter, despite a challenging economic environment for consumers. Retail sales in the U.S. were driven by strong product appeal, success of outreach efforts and slightly improved product availability for most of the quarter. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were up 6.6%.","Market share in the fourth quarter strengthened 1.6 points versus prior year to 60.9%, and full year share finished up 1.5 points to 57.2%, another record year of market share.","Finally, retail inventory in the U.S. fell from the end of last year by approximately 1,200 units. We reduced shipments in preparation for our flexible manufacturing capability, which allows us to begin surging production with seasonal demand in the first quarter of this year.","We also expect retail inventory to be down at the end of 2013 as we prepare for manufacturing surge capability at our Kansas City facility in the first half of 2014.","On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in international markets for the quarter grew 6.3%, driven by strong growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. For the full year, international retail sales were up 5.6%.","During the fourth quarter, the Latin America region was up 23.5%, driven by Brazil and Mexico. As we exited 2012, we had 14 dealerships in Brazil and are on track to continue to grow this important market into the future.","Retail sales in the Asia Pacific region were up 14.8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit sales growth in Australia and emerging markets. Japan saw a strong growth despite a challenging economic environment and intense competitive activity.","The EMEA region was down 3.3% for the quarter compared to 2011 as we continued to see softness in the Southern European markets.","For the full year, retail sales in the EMEA region were down 3.0%. Market share in Europe through November was 13.3%, down only slightly to the prior year despite the economic concerns in that market. We expect continued volatility and pressure on sales in Europe in 2013.","Canada was down 13.8% in the quarter compared to the same period in 2011, which benefited from a year end sales boost prior to a sales tax change effective January 2012. For the full year, Canada retail sales were up 0.7%.","International expansion, especially in emerging markets, is one of our 3 core areas of investment for future growth. During the quarter, 15 dealerships were opened in 12 different countries. Since 2009, 93 new dealerships have opened, great progress toward our goal of 100 to 150 by the end of 2014.","On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down compared to last year as we prepared for surge manufacturing, which we initiated at York this month. Shipments were within our expected shipment range of 44,500 to 49,500 motorcycles. Temporary production constraints at York eased during the fourth quarter, allowing us a higher mix of Touring motorcycles compared to last year.","International shipments as a percent of total were up only slightly compared to 2011, reflecting the tough market conditions in Europe.","Given that our European business was down in 2012 and the economic concerns that remain Europe for the near term, we no longer believe that we will meet our goal of international retail sales exceeding 40% of total retail sales by 2014. However, we continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic sales through 2014.","On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Product segment was down 1.5% in the fourth quarter and up 6% for the full year behind strong growth from all our businesses during the year. Motorcycle revenue was down 2.6% behind the 7.2% decrease in shipments during the fourth quarter and up 5.9% behind the 6.2% increase in shipments for the full year.","For the full year, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $44 from the prior year, primarily driven by unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing and favorable mix. On average, our key currencies during 2012 were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 6% compared to last year.","Parts and Accessories sales were up 0.2% for the quarter and up 5.3% for the full year compared to 2011. General Merchandise revenue was up 6.8% in the fourth quarter and up 9.2% for the full year.","Turning to restructuring on Slide 16. In 2012, restructuring costs were $28 million, and we experienced approximately $33 million in temporary inefficiencies. We achieved savings of $280 million, set our targets along the way and had successfully transformed our manufacturing operations and continued to advance our product development capabilities.","In 2013, we expect to substantially ramp up the current restructuring activities. During 2013, our efforts will focus on completing operating system training in Wisconsin and Kansas City, existing our Australian wheel and hub manufacturing operations and preparing for surge manufacturing in Kansas City in 2014. We expect these activities will result in approximately $13 million of restructuring costs and approximately $17 million of temporary inefficiencies.","Upon completion of those restructuring activities at the end of 2013, we expect to achieve a full annual savings of approximately $320 million starting in 2014, with expected total costs -- restructuring costs, of approximately $495 million.","Since 2009, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. As we near the completion of this restructuring, we will continue our focus on improving retail capabilities and strengthening world-class distribution channels and product development capabilities. We have established a culture of continuous improvement, and we'll continue to look for ways to operate in the most efficient and profitable manner.","On Slide 17, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 31.8%, which was 0.6 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin for the quarter was driven by a flexible favorable mix behind increased Touring production, favorable pricing and modestly lower raw material costs compared to last year. As anticipated, foreign currency exchange was unfavorable behind a stronger U.S. dollar. Finally, manufacturing costs were flat to prior year as restructuring savings were largely offset by loss absorption due to significantly lower production in the quarter.","Full year gross margin was 34.8%, which was up 1.4 percentage points from the prior year. Gross margin finished at the low end of our expected range of 34.75% to 35.75%, primarily a result of key foreign currencies devaluing quite significantly beginning in the second quarter of 2012. The adverse financial impact of the devaluation was somewhat tempered in 2012 due to our currency hedges.","We continue -- we expect continued unfavorable currency exchange in 2013 as our currency hedges that were initiated at higher exchange rates roll off in 2013.","On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 5.3%, up 1.8 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring costs, partially offset by a slightly higher SG&A. While we expected SG&A for the quarter to be modestly below last year, it actually finished $1.3 million higher than last year.","For the full year, SG&A increased $49.4 million from 2011, primarily as a result of investment in our future growth. As a percent of revenue, full year SG&A decreased slightly versus the prior year. We continue to expect SG&A spending will increase on a year-over-year basis in 2013 and 2014 as we continue to invest in growth initiatives, but decrease as a percent of revenue through 2014.","Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, HDFS's operating profit increased $6.2 million or 10.9% compared to last year. The 3 key drivers of fourth quarter results were: First, the provision for wholesale credit losses was $2.6 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to favorable wholesale portfolio performance; Second, net interest income was up $2.2 million resulting from lower interest expense, which was driven by a favorable cost of funds and lower debt levels; finally, the all other category was up $3.9 million, driven primarily by the strength in our insurance business.","On a full year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $284.7 million, an increase of $15.9 million or 5.9% compared to 2011. We are very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. We believe HDFS's 2013 operating income will be modestly lower than 2012 as the business benefited from $17 million of 2012 credit loss reserve releases which will not repeat in 2013.","In addition, we also expect modestly higher credit losses in 2013 due to changing consumer behavior, HDFS's funding of additionally prudently restructured loans in the near and subprime segments and lower recoveries resulting from lower charge-offs in prior periods.","Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations on Slide 20. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John. And good morning.","During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 17.6% or $61.5 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind the strong increase in retail sales and a 2.8 percentage point increase in market share.","Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year. For the full year, HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 50.9%, flat compared to 2011.","The overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. In 2012, approximately 80% of our new loan originations were prime. At year end, 88% of the total portfolio was comprised of loans originated after underwriting changes HDFS made in January 2009.","With the higher level of receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn rolling off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 0.4% compared to a year ago. This decline in receivables pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales due to downturn that we expect will continue to impact HDFS net interest income through the first half of 2013.","Moving on to credit performance on Slide 21. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2012, was 3.94% or 9 basis points higher than 2011. I want to point out that 2011 and 2012 are the only years where HDFS has finished the year with a 30-day delinquency rate below 4.5%, so credit quality remained in good shape.","Annual retail credit losses improved by 41 basis points to 0.79% in 2012 compared to 2011, driven by the impact of changes in underwriting and collections as well as a lower frequency of loss. This is the lowest level of retail credit losses at HDFS in over 10 years.","A portion of this loss improvement is due to recoveries in loans written off in prior years. Given the strong credit performance of loans originated since 2009, we expect lower levels of recoveries in future periods.","We are pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2012. During the year, we maintained a strong liquidity position, reduced our cost of funds and delivered strong profitability.","We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","A recent example of this is the $185 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. earlier this month.","Now let me turn it back to John.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 22.","You will see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes the impact of the repayment of a $400 million HDFS Medium Term Note. In addition, HDFS had $1.66 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","Earlier this month, there were 2 significant transactions related to cash. Larry just mentioned the dividend HDFS paid to H-D Inc. We also made $175 million contribution to our qualified pension plans. This contribution reduces the $221 million Q4 2012 increase in our pension and postretirement liability, which resulted from the discount rate assumption changing from 5.3% to 4.2%.","And I'm also very pleased to report that during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $53.4 million. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is its top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now I'll review the remaining HDFS Inc. financials on Slide 23.","I'd like to highlight 2 items on this slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $793.1 million during 2012, even after a $200 million contribution to our pension plans in January of last year.","And second, our full year effective tax rate from continuing operations was 35.1% compared to 30.9% in 2011. The 2011 tax rate benefited from a change in Wisconsin tax laws associated with certain net operating losses, the favorable settlement of an IRS audit and the impact of the federal research and development tax credit. In 2013, we expect full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 34.8%, which includes the impact of a restatement of the federal research and development tax credit with the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.","The summary of full year 2012 financial results is on Slide 24.","We had net income of $623.9 million from continuing operations in 2012, which was up 13.8% compared to 2011. 2012 earnings were driven by strong growth in the Motorcycles segment. The Motorcycles segment operating income was up 27.5% compared to last year. Motorcycle growth was driven by higher revenues and improved gross and operating margins.","HDFS operating income was also up 5.9%.","On Slide 25, you'll see that for 2013, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 259,000 and 264,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4.5% to 6.5% from 2012.","Our 2013 shipment guidance reflects new model year 2013 and '14 products, continued success of our outreach efforts in the U.S., improved product availability in the U.S., continued expansion of our international distribution network and the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand.","While we are very optimistic about the strength of our business and brand, we remain cautious about the world economies, in particular in the U.S. and Europe. During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 71,000 and 76,000 units, which is up approximately 10% to 18% compared to last year. This increase is driven by the surge manufacturing capabilities we have put in place.","We expect retail inventory to increase by the end of the first quarter as we prepare for the 2013 selling season.","We expect full year 2013 gross margin will be between 35.25% and 36.25%. 2013 gross margin will have both puts and takes. On the positive side, we continue to expect approximately $25 million in incremental restructuring savings, about $16 million less in temporary inefficiencies than we experienced in 2012, incremental margin behind higher production and higher pricing. To a lesser extent, we expect favorable product mix.","On the negative side, we expect unfavorable currency exchange as we lap hedges established at higher levels of foreign exchange, higher pension expense and pressure on materials cost.","For Q1 2013, we expect gross margin will be slightly improved over Q1 2012, driven by increased production, largely offset by unfavorable currency exchange. We expect an adverse impact from currency -- foreign currency in Q1 2013 to be similar to the impact we experienced in Q4 2012.","Capital expenditures in 2013 are expected to be between $200 million and $220 million.","Looking back on 2012 -- looking back, 2012 was truly a pivotal year. We completed a successful ERP implementation and effectively transformed our manufacturing and product development operations. Retail sales in the U.S. were another bright spot. Once again, we gained market share, and outreach sales grew at twice the rate as our sales to core customers. In international markets, our prudent investment in emerging markets helped offset softness related to the challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe.","Gross margin during the year was up 1.4 points and operating margin was up 2.5 points. We are excited that the temporary capacity constraints related to restructuring are now behind us, and we look forward to the completion of our current restructuring activities.","2012 was another year of delivering significant shareholder value. Our share price was up 25.6%, we increased dividends by 24%, and repurchased $300 million of our shares. 2013 is our 110th anniversary year, and we plan to continue to bring new customers into the Harley-Davidson brand from all over the world.","As we have done for many years, we'll deliver market-leading products and experiences that fulfill dreams of personal freedoms like only Harley-Davidson can. We will remain focused on executing our growth strategies, and we expect to continue to deliver strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I actually want to ask a couple of clarification questions about the first quarter, if I could. I think the Q1 shipment guidance is higher than most expected. Is that entirely a reflection of the surge capabilities coming on line or is there also sort of a message in there about either kind of view of retail sales this year or kind of view of inventories being lower than you want them to be? And then my follow-up is just a clarification question on the currency impact for Q1. John, when you say similar to Q4, are you referring to that on a gross profit dollar basis or on a gross profit margin basis?","John A. Olin","Okay. Number one is, in the Q4, we have shipment guidance of 71,000 to 76,000 units, and that's up 10% to 18%. And yes, that is driven by our surge  manufacturing capability in our York facility. So the overall strategy has been to produce closer to customer demand. The customer demand is toward the end of the first quarter and the second quarter, and so we will put the units in and increase overall availability in the first quarter. Now having said that, we ended a year ago at very low inventories. As a matter of fact, 2 years ago, we're pretty low, and last year, we fell another 4,400 units. So as we exit the first quarter with the increased shipments, we would expect inventories to be up on a year-over-year basis. The second question, Ed, you asked was with regards to Q1 currency. And the comment was we expected to be in line with what we saw in Q4, and that would be, yes, both from a revenue standpoint and a gross -- impact on gross profit standpoint. So we would expect continued devaluation on a year-over-year basis affecting revenue and also the loss on overall hedging similar to what we saw in Q1 -- I'm sorry, loss similar to what we saw in Q4.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, on that FX, just to continue that on for 2013, in your Slide 17, you had $17 million negative FX impact for 2012. Collectively for '13, do you anticipate that at this point being higher, lower, similar to that? And then also on the gross margin guidance that you have here, is there any way to quantify what would be maybe a surge learning curve impact or at minimum, just is that some factor here that is within your gross margin guidance for 2013?","John A. Olin","Okay. Tim, the first question was on a full year basis.  In 2012, we had $17 million impact on foreign currency. We're not going to quantify that further. Again, the first quarter is going to look similar to the fourth quarter of last year, and to say that on a full year basis, we expect currency to adversely impact both revenue and gross profit. The second question that you had was with regards to the surge learning curve and how is that incorporated into the, I believe, the gross margin guidance. So one is some of the onetime aspects of surge is incorporated in our temporary inefficiencies, and some of those came in 2012 as we prepared. The first part of the surge opportunity was in hiring -- recruiting and hiring, and a lot of that took place last year would be included in temporary inefficiencies in 2012. As we look forward into next year, there are some costs that would be included and fall under gross margin through temporary inefficiencies. And then also at the end of the year, we've got Kansas City going onto surge, and we would expect some similar onetime costs as we set the system up and get over that learning curve that you mentioned.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, could you just clarify with respect to dealer inventory for all of 2013 whether you still expect to reduce that inventory on a year-over-year basis or whether it might be closer to flat, given what you're doing in York? And then secondly, just comment on used bike values.","John A. Olin","So the question with regards to dealer inventory, let's take a look at the entire year. For the last couple of years, we talked about inventory being light, in particular in the first, second and third quarter. We've been constrained from a capacity standpoint, largely through our York facility, for probably 6 of the last 6 or 7 quarters. Those constraints were lifted in the fourth quarter of 2012, and you saw the mix dramatically shift to Touring. As we enter into 2013, we feel very good about our overall mix of inventories, but as we look at the entire year, we would expect to improve availability or improve overall inventories in the first, second and third quarters. We continue to expect in the fourth quarter that overall retail inventory will fall slightly, and that is, again, in anticipation of our Kansas City facility being able to surge its production similar to what we're seeing in York this year, and therefore, we won't need to put as much in the dealer network on the fourth quarter when customers are not buying as many motorcycles. So improved availability for most of the year, Qs 1 through 3, and down slightly at the end of the year as we prepare for a surge at Kansas City. The second question was, what are we seeing in used bike values? Again, we saw the big inflection of used bike values was in Q4 of 2011. Since then, we've really seen stable values. We haven't seen many moves in either direction, and again, it just leads us to believe that the used bike glut issue is behind us and that we can grow our new bike sales at or above the rate of used bike into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Hardiman from Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to follow up on the 1Q shipment guidance and figure out how that fits into the year. Obviously, the growth in the first quarter is way ahead of the growth for the year, which implies the rest of the year will need to be short of that full year rate. Is that entirely a fourth quarter event or will we see that sort of revert to the mean in 2Q or 3Q? And just a clarification separately on the SG&A side, you talked about how that was higher than you anticipated in the fourth quarter. Were there some items that you'd like to call out there? Does that flow through into 2013 or is it sort of a onetime event?","John A. Olin","Okay. James, with regards to the first quarter, we do expect to be up more than our full year average. So first quarter, up 10% to 18%; on full year basis, we would look to be up 4.5% to 6.5%. Again, the reason we're doing that is we finished a year ago at extremely low inventories. And obviously, it's looking right at our selling season that really starts in late March and April, so we look to replenish a lot of those inventories. With regards to that, we're not going to provide guidance for the other 3 quarters, except as you pointed it out, in terms of a growth rate, they will be, on average, less than the first quarter. But we're not going to provide that.  One quarter out, we'll provide the next quarter shipment guidance. The second question is with regards to SG&A in the fourth quarter. Yes, 3 months ago, we sat here and we thought that we would down slightly. We ended up up slightly. And there's nothing big driving it. It's really just the timing of year-end expenses. When we looked at the overall quarter, we had a favorability on a year-over-year basis due to a recall that we had in 2011. And a lot of that was replaced by investment in our future growth. We spent about $7 million in the quarter investing in future growth. And that's in line with our overall rate of investment on a full year basis. On a full year basis, we spent about a little over $30 million in our future growth initiatives. We would expect that type of spending and growth into 2013, and we do expect 2013 SG&A to be higher than 2012 but lower as a percent of revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, with the temporary inefficiencies, I believe you said $17 million for the year.  I was just wondering, can you just walk us through how that might fall in the quarters? I believe on your last call, you said that they were just mainly be the inefficiencies in the first half and then the second half wouldn't have any, so I was just trying to reconcile that.","John A. Olin","Yes. So this year, we had 33 -- I'm sorry, in 2012, $33 million.  We expect about half of that to go away, so we would expect about $17 million next year. We don't provide that gating, Felicia, by quarter. But there's 3 main activities that are going to drive that spending. One is continued training at our Wisconsin and Kansas City facilities.  That should be largely even through the year, maybe starting to taper off at the end of the year. The second piece is what I just mentioned.  In preparation for surge, we have a little bit of a cost due York in the first quarter and then we'll be preparing for Kansas City in the fourth quarter. And then finally, as we exit our facility in Australia, those expenses will build throughout the year until we completely exit that facility. So I don't think that there's any dramatic change in the spending of that, but I can't provide quarterly guidance with regards to temporary inefficiencies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Pat Nolan for Rod. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, on the shipment guidance and what's kind of underlying that as far as your assumptions, could you give us just some color on what you're expecting for overall industry growth next year? And also as a follow-up on your comments about pricing and mix, so if we look at it on a full year basis, pricing was about a $30 million positive in 2012 and mix was a $5 million positive. You said mix was going to be less of a positive but pricing still positive.  Do you think it could be in the same range of benefit which you achieved in 2012?","John A. Olin","Okay, Pat, the first question on shipment guidance and what we expect out of industry growth. We don't provide a forecast of the industry. But just in general, we feel very good about the industry and the strength of the industry. In 2012, the overall industry was up 4%, and actually in the fourth quarter, it was up 5.3%. So we see the overall industry strengthening as our competition works through some of the used bike pricing issues that they have. We do see growth next year, but we don't provide a quantification of that. When we look at our growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, it's driven by the appeal of the brand and our 110th year, model year product that we feel very good about, 2013 model year product has been very strong for the last several months, and we would expect that. And then we're very excited about what we're coming out with for the 2014 product. Outreach continues to go well. We would expect that next year for outreach to grow faster than our core customer, and in 2012, it grew at double that rate. And then product availability I've talked about, then finally, international distribution, we'll continue to expand that. Tempering some of those things are the overall concern with world economies, in particular, in the U.S. and Europe. The next question that you asked is the magnitude of motorcycle pricing and mix favorability. We are not going to provide overall line item guidance on the elements that make up gross margin. But as you know, we took pricing in August of 2012. So that will, on a year-over-year basis, lap for about 8 months, and that was about a 0.75% price increase on a worldwide basis. And again, overall, product mix was up slightly when you look at family mix of Touring. We feel good about how we entered the year on mix within family, within models and within regions of the world. We expect slight mix favorability into next year, but that's about all I can provide with regards to quantifying.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Now that it's over, what was the dealer reaction to the model year shift? Is this something you'll continue with going forward or will there be more changes? And is there any way to quantify what kind of impact it may have had to retail sales in the year?","John A. Olin","Gerrick, actually, the dealer response was very positive. The reason we did it was because the dealers requested that we push it back. So the response was positive. It certainly was a difficult time to do it. When we plan to do it a couple of years prior, we didn't realize we would also be putting in the ERP system. So I think that added some complexity to our third quarter and drove inventories a little bit lower, well, a fair amount lower than we would have anticipated. But we are very pleased with the dealer show being in late August, and we expect to continue that into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from MorningStar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I know that dealer presence or the rate that you're kind of opening them globally remains unchanged, but can you talk a little bit about how you guys perceive your opportunities in the different geographic regions as kind of Europe has began to struggle a little bit more or do you see more opportunities in maybe Asia now than before, and how are you addressing that?","Keith E. Wandell","Yes. This is Keith. First of all, we said, I think 3 years ago, that we were going to open between 100 and 150 new dealers around the world. As you mentioned, we're certainly on plan to do that. We believe that there is still opportunity really in every market. We feel that the strength of the brand, the products that -- the new products that we're bringing to market have tremendous appeal. Clearly, and John mentioned it in his comments, Southern Europe is weak right now because of some of the economic struggles that they're seeing. We did mention in our notes earlier, we have a very strong year in Latin America.  We think there is still upside and opportunity in that region. We had a strong year in Asia Pacific, and we highlighted some of those areas, and a couple of them we talked about were China and India, and we think there is tremendous potential there as well. Our sales, while increasing every year in those regions, are still pretty small. And so we think that as disposable personal income in those regions continue to grow and we provide the right kind of products in those markets, we think there's upside there for us. Then there's other emerging markets, which we've just sort of have begun to touch, so we think the future is very bright in terms of our international expansion","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on HDFS if I could. You mentioned expectations for some changing consumer behavior in 2013.  I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that a little bit. I guess delinquencies are still low, but this was the first time we've seen a tick up a little bit in the last few years, so just maybe a little bit more color around on how you see that unfolding in '13?","Lawrence G. Hund","Sure. I think -- Ed, this is Larry Hund. If you look over the last year or 2, what we've seen is consumer behavior, consumers have really been focused on rebuilding their credit profile, deleveraging, paying off debt. And I think that's benefited us and other vehicle finance lenders. So in the fourth quarter, we saw a very slight increase in our delinquency, and I think that's pretty consistent with what we're seeing out in the market as well. I think you're starting to see consumers take on a little bit more debt, maybe being a little bit less conservative. And I think when that behavior changes, the offshoot of it is slightly higher delinquency and slightly higher credit losses, and I think that's what we signaled for next year.","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Keith, I had a bigger picture question for you. You guys gave us some good color about how to think about gross margins in '13 given what we know now. But now that you have the surge capacity in place, I'm assuming that at York, it doesn't just stop there. So I was wondering if you could help us understand what type of continuous improvement programs you might be looking at or just other ways to continuously -- or to use that word again, to continuously improve kind of the excellent productivity that you'll be getting out of York just with this surge capacity, and then perhaps also out of Kansas City.","Keith E. Wandell","Right. Well, I mean, first of all, Felicia, if you look at our strategy that we've had in place since last several years, there is really only 4 pillars. And one of them is continuous improvement, right? And so I think you make a very good point. And what we've really been focused on is getting the entire organization to understand that no matter how well we're doing, whether it's in sales, in marketing or whether it\u2019s in engineering or whether it's in manufacturing, that we can always do better. And so if you think about York, if you think about Kansas City, Pilgrim Road, all of our plants, Tomahawk, and the transformation that we're going through, certainly this is just sort of the beginning, right? I mean, in other words, we've just now kicked that off. And our expectation is that we will continue to improve, we'll continue to improve our productivity, we'll continue to improve our performance around quality, the health, safety and well-being of our employees, and certainly, all of those things tend to make for a much smoother, more efficient operations. So my -- our expectation is that we'll continue to get better as we go to surge the next year, the following year and the year after. I don't know if that answered your question specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wish -- I was hoping you could just touch on your own company inventories, down about 6%, in preparation for flex.  Should work-in-progress be up or are finished goods down? What were the puts and takes in the company inventory there?","John A. Olin","This is John. The company inventory is down versus a year ago. The main driver of that, Gerrick, is if you recall a year ago, we were building inventory in the fourth quarter and we were keeping it in company-owned inventory, and we were going to release that, and we did release it when the ERP implementation went off. So with the new ERP implementation, we're expecting production to be down quite significantly in the month that we launched. So we had higher production in the fourth quarter than we did this year and last year, and also higher inventories. So that's the biggest reason for the drop. But as you pointed out, because production is going to be up a fair amount in the first quarter, yes, certainly, we have to bring on more materials for that production, and that would take our work-in-progress inventories up and our raw materials up a little bit as well. So those 2 work to offset each  other, but net-net, we're down as you had mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Another follow-up for Larry, if you would. You talked about HDFS being down in 2013. Obviously that was the initial expectation for 2012, and I think that's been better than expected across-the-board. Obviously, that's a testament to the work that Larry and the rest of the team has done over the course of the year. But can we talk about, as the year has progressed, what surprised you, maybe to the upside, in HDFS? And as we roll forward to 2013, talk about some of those same factors.  What are the odds that 2013 could look a lot like 2012 in terms of outperforming expectations, or are we really at the end of the runway with some of these items?","Lawrence G. Hund","Okay, James, this is Larry. The biggest thing, I think, surprise in 2012 was just how low the retail credit losses were. At 79 basis points, clearly the lowest we've seen in over a decade and considerably better than what we had seen in 2011. So really, you can say that drove a fair amount of profit for us last year. I would say, when you take a look at 2013, we don't think it's realistic to expect that continued drive downward in retail credit losses. I think we expect the credit portfolio to perform well, it's in good shape going into the year. But we think, as far as the consumer is concerned, that they're starting to shift their behavior a little bit. We may see a little bit higher credit losses. So as far as, call it surprises on the upside next year, we think there's probably less potential for that just given where -- how low credit losses were in 2012.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Keith, just to revisit your point on the additional emerging markets. You'd commented previously a few times, about looking at some potential different approaches in especially the Indian market. Any update you can give us there or when we may start to see some fulfillment or evidence of that emerging?","Keith E. Wandell","Well, I think, Tim, you know that we have a fully up and running CKD operation in India, and we're actually assembling bikes over there and we assemble certain models, and more and more models. We continue to open dealerships. And we continue to look at what are other opportunities in that part of the world. So I think, going forward, we'll probably have more say about those things, but right now, that's kind of where we're at.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue.","John A.

Welcome to Harley-Davidson's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. The audio for today's call is being webcast live on harley-davidson.com. The support slides can be accessed on our website by clicking on Company, Investor Relations, then Events and Presentations.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call. This morning, you'll hear from Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund. Then we'll open the call for questions. So let's get started. Keith?","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Harley-Davidson had a great year, and I couldn't be more proud of the entire team: Of our employees, dealers and suppliers. We achieved what we set out to do from exciting new products to improved manufacturing operations, retail gains, as well as the growing diversity of our customer base. All of these translated to continued strong improvement in the company's financial performance and shareholder value.","Full-year EPS grew more than 20% on a 5.7% increase in revenue. And at year end, Harley-Davidson's total shareholder returns were up more than 40% from the start of the year, outpacing the S&P 500.","In manufacturing and product development, Harley-Davidson has been relentless at driving improvements throughout the company that enable us to design, build and deliver motorcycles with greater speed, efficiency, safety and quality. With the launch of Surge Production early last year, we were able to build motorcycles closer to when they were needed, and to have the flexibility to adjust more quickly to market forces. We saw great improvement in better matching our production to customer preferences, seasonality and geographic demand. And with the startup of Surge Production at our Kansas City plant earlier this month, we expect continued improvements on this front.","And then, there are the products. The product -- Project Rushmore motorcycles that we rolled out in August were the first to come through our new world-class product development pipeline. They introduced major innovation and design improvements and bring the voice of the customer into our product design process in a whole new way. From the launch on August 19 through the end of the year, our dealers sold nearly 28,000 motorcycles worldwide from the 8 models in the Rushmore line up. And these bikes were embraced not only by our core customers, but our outreach customers as well.","And then on the heels of Rushmore, we revealed the Street 750 and the Street 500. And these totally new motorcycles are designed for the lifestyle and riding needs of a growing generation of urban, young adults globally. The reveal of these motorcycles generated a tremendous amount of excitement, and we're looking forward to the retail rollout in the next coming months.","And as we look down the road, there's a lot more to come. We have other new incredible motorcycles that are in our product development pipeline. And we believe these new products, together with our efforts, and those of our dealers, will enable us to continue to broaden our reach.","Last April, we reported that for the fifth straight year, Harley-Davidson was the undisputed U.S. market share leader in new motorcycle sales to each of our outreach customer segments, who we define as young adults 18 to 34, women, African-Americans and Hispanics. And you may recall that one of our key goals is to grow sales in the U.S. to outreach customers at a faster rate than we grow sales to our core customers. And we did that for the first time in 2012. And now I'm pleased to report that in 2013, retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to outreach customers in the U.S. grew at more than twice the rate of sales growth to our core customers.","The company also continued to grow and expand its international reach in 2013. Brazil is our largest market in Latin America. And last year, we captured the market share leadership in the 601cc and above category for the very first time. Overall, retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Latin America were up more than 13%. And in Europe, we increased our market share, and hold the #2 position in the highly-competitive 601 and up segment.","And we had our best year ever for new motorcycle sales in our Asia-Pacific markets. We, again, were the market share leader in the 601cc plus in both Japan and Australia, and we saw strong growth in the emerging markets. Worldwide, Harley-Davidson now sells motorcycles in 89 countries, and we've opened 118 new dealerships since 2009. So all in all, 2013 was an outstanding year, and we haven't even touched on the success of the 110th anniversary on our new e-commerce rollout and a significant other number of highlights.","The company and the brand are strong. And as we look at 2014 and beyond, we believe we're in a great position to leverage our momentum, expand our reach among new and existing customers and further strengthen Harley-Davidson's position as one of the world's leading brands. So again, thanks for your interest and investment. And now, I'm going to turn it over to John Olin.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review 4th quarter financial results starting on Slide 11. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 1.7% to $1.19 billion. Our fourth quarter net income improved to $75.4 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 6.8%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.34 per share, up 9.7% from the year ago quarter. Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was $60.7 million, up 14.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The strong increase in Motorcycle business was driven by a 2.1% increase in revenue despite a 1.0% decline in shipments.","Motorcycle segment operating income benefited from lower SG&A and restructuring spending, partially offset by a slightly lower gross margin percent. As expected, operating income at HDFS was down behind a higher provision for retail motorcycle loan losses. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial results.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 12. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.7% during the fourth quarter, driven by increases in both the U.S. and international markets. For the full-year, worldwide retail sales were up 4.4% compared to 2012. This increase was in line with our expectations, driven by momentum in the second half, following the launch of our model year 2014 motorcycles.","Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 13. Retail sales in the U.S. were up 6.3% in the fourth quarter, positively impacted by the continued momentum from the 2014 motorcycle lineup. As we anticipated, U.S. retail sales growth in the fourth quarter slowed from the third quarter's growth rate, behind 2 key drivers. First, a tough year-over-year comparison of 8.4% growth in 2012. Q4 2012 benefited from the retiming of sales from Q3 when availability was limited by production disruptions related to our ERP implementation at York in Q3 2012. And second, we believe the impact of the absence of the popular Road Glide models in the 2014 model year become evident in Q4. Worldwide retail sales represented about 9% of total U.S. retail sales in the fourth quarter of 2012. Road Glide models were discontinued for the 2014 model year, but will be reintroduced when they're upgraded with Rushmore features. The absence of Road Glide was also evident in our market share for the quarter. As we have discussed, we have expected to give back some market share, which we did in the fourth quarter.","We continue to be very excited about the momentum behind our model year 2014 products, especially Project Rushmore. During the second half of 2013, U.S. retail sales were up 14.8%, which was right in line with our expectations. For the full-year, U.S. retail sales were up 4.4%, and Harley-Davidson's market share was up 1.0 percentage points, finishing the year at 54.9%, which is a record high, and represents the fifth consecutive annual increase. Over the last 5 years, we have gained 13.4 points of share, and hold a 47%[ph] point lead over our nearest competitor.","Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was down approximately 1,850 motorcycles at the end of Q4 compared to 2012. Year-end retail inventory was down, as we prepared to implement surge manufacturing at our Kansas City plant, and as we continue to remain committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand. Overall, we're comfortable with the 2013 dealer retail inventory levels.","For 2014, we expect U.S. year-end retail inventory to be up from 2013 levels, driven primarily by the addition of the new Street motorcycles.","On Slide 14, you'll see retail sales in our international markets grew 4.7% in the fourth quarter and 4.3% for the full-year. In our EMEA region, Q4 retail sales were up 5.5%, driven by our core European markets, which were up 5.1% compared to last year. This increase was driven by strong growth in Northern Europe, led by Germany and France. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were down 1.0%. In 2013, our 601-plus cc market share in Europe was 12.8%, up 0.7 percentage points versus the same period last year. Our market share gains in Europe are especially encouraging in light of the economic situation and promotional discounting by our competitors in that region. While we're encouraged by fourth quarter results, we remain concerned with ongoing economic challenges in Europe and the potential impact on our European business. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across Europe and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets in that region.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 6.1% in the fourth quarter, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets, especially India and China. For the full-year, the Asia-Pacific region delivered growth of 9.8%.","Latin America region retail sales were down 2.8% in the quarter, as a result of a decrease in Brazil, partially offset by growth in Mexico. During the fourth quarter, Brazil's retail sales fell due to a very slow Brazilian motorcycle homologation process that kept us from getting our new Rushmore and Sportster motorcycles in the dealerships in 2013. These models have now been approved, and will start arriving in dealerships in mid February.","For the full year, retail sales were up 13.1% in our Latin America region. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 13.3% in the fourth quarter, and 4.6% for the full-year. As we have discussed, we have been very focused on investing in our international businesses. Since 2009, we have targeted 100 to 150 international new dealer points through 2014. And over the last 4 years, we have opened 118, with 2\/3 being in emerging markets.","On Slide 15, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down slightly compared to last year, as we prepared to initiate surge manufacturing in Kansas City this month. Fourth quarter shipments finished within our expected range of 45,000 to 50,000 motorcycles.","During the quarter, the mix of touring motorcycles decreased 2.1 percentage points from the prior year, as we lapped a very high Touring mix during the same period last year. In 2012, Touring shipments were unusually high in the fourth quarter, following production disruptions related to the implementation of our ERP system at York. 2013 international shipments, as a percent of total, were slightly higher than 2012. We are committed to investing in international growth, and continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next 3 to 5 years.","On Slide 16, you'll see revenue for the motorcycle and related product segment was up 2.1% in the fourth quarter, and up 6.4% for the full-year. Motorcycle revenue was up 1.4% despite a 1.0% decrease in shipments. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from price increases versus prior year. For the full-year, motorcycle revenue was up 8.0%, behind a 5.2% increase in shipments.","For 2013, the average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $412 from the prior year, primarily driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact. On average, our key currencies in 2013 were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 3% compared to 2012.","Parts and Accessories sales were up 4.8% in the fourth quarter, and 1.5% for the full year. General merchandise was up 2.5% in the quarter, and down 1.2% for the full year compared to 2012. Both the fourth quarter and full-year growth were impacted by lapping the strong sell-in of 110th anniversary apparel and accessories, which began in Q3 of 2012.","Turning to restructuring on Slide 17. As we closed out our restructuring activity at the end of 2013, we recorded a Q4 restructuring benefit of $0.4 million, versus an expense of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. We also experienced approximately $4 million in temporary inefficiencies, versus approximately $7 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, we recorded a restructuring benefit of $1.2 million, versus a 2012 expense of $28.5 million. Temporary inefficiencies during the year were approximately $15 million, versus $33 million last year. We realized annual savings from all restructuring activities of approximately $310 million in 2013, met our targets along the way, and have successfully transformed our manufacturing operations and continue to advance our product development capabilities. We expect to realize approximately $10 million in additional savings during 2014 and going forward.","With the completion of our restructuring activities, we have significantly reduced our fixed cost structure and therefore, improved the overall profitability of the company. At the start of restructuring our motorcycle fixed cost were in the range of 20% to 25% of our motorcycle manufacturing cost. Beginning in 2014, we expect our motorcycle fixed cost to be approximately 15% to 20% of motorcycle manufacturing cost, resulting in gross margin on incremental motorcycle volume of approximately 47%.","Going forward, we'll remain intensely focused on improving our cost structure and managing the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","On Slide 18, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 31.5%, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Volume, price and raw materials were all favorable for the quarter, partially offset by unfavorable mix, foreign currency exchange and manufacturing. During the quarter, mix was unfavorable behind a lower mix of Touring motorcycles compared to 2012 when touring mix was high following the ERP implementation at York in Q3 2012. Foreign currency exchange was unfavorable for the fourth quarter as the result of a sizable devaluation of the yen, the Brazilian real and the Australian dollar on a year-over-year basis.","Manufacturing cost in Q4 reflected the benefits from restructuring and lower temper efficiencies, as compared to last year's fourth quarter. However, manufacturing costs were adversely impacted by lower year-over-year production levels, as we prepare to implement surge manufacturing at Kansas City in 2014. Full year gross margin was 35.4%, which was up 0.6 percentage points from last year. We are very pleased with our gross margin growth in 2013, especially in light of the fact that foreign currency exchange negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points.","On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 5.9%, up 0.6 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin of $60.7 million for the quarter was favorably impacted by slightly higher gross margin, lower year-over-year restructuring expense and lower SG&A spending.","For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 16.6%, up 2.1 percentage points compared to last year. We were very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in 2013.","Now moving on to our financial services segment on Slide 20. In the fourth quarter, HDFS operating profit decreased $1.7 million, or 2.6% compared to last year. The 2 primary factors impacting fourth quarter results where: First, net interest income was favorable $9.3 million, driven by a lower interest expense, primarily due to lower cost of funds; and second, the change in the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable by $13 million due to higher retail credit losses. On a full-year basis, HDFS posted an operating profit of $283.1 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 0.6% compared to 2012. We are very pleased with the performance of the financial services business. Going forward, we continue to expect pressure on HDFS' operating income as the result of modestly higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increase in competition and higher year-over-year borrowing costs. Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 21. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 14.2%, or $58.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year new retail motorcycle sales and a 4.3-percentage-point increase in retail financing market share for the fourth quarter compared to last year.","For the full year, HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. increased to 54.5%, compared to 50.9% in 2012. The primary drivers of the year-over-year market share gain were the pricing changes in the prime segment, which were initiated in the second quarter in response to increasing competition and the strong sales of Touring motorcycles.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 3.7% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans, funded in both the prime and subprime segments. In 2013, between 75% and 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime.","Moving on to credit performance on Slide 22. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2013 was 3.71%, or 23 basis points lower than 2012. This is the lowest year end 30-day delinquency level in at least 12 years. Annual retail credit losses increased by 30 basis points to 1.09% compared to 2012, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years. This was expected, given the lower level of credit losses in the past few years has left a smaller pool of potential recovery dollars. In addition, HDFS experienced an increase in losses due to lower recovery values on repossessed motorcycles following the launch of our new Rushmore motorcycles in the third quarter. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2013, as we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, deliver solid credit performance and contribute strong profitability. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc., as demonstrated by the $120 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. earlier this month. Now let me turn it back to John.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 23. As you'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.17 billion of cash in marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.28 billion of available liquidity through bank conduit and credit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $176 million, with a full-year total of 7.7 million shares for $456 million. During the first quarter of this year, we plan to pay off the $303 million of H-D, Inc. high-interest debt. We do not expect to make a contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2014, as the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans improved by $600 million as a result of robust market returns and higher discount rates.","As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 24. I'd like to highlight 2 items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $977.1 million in 2013. Operating cash flow was up $175.6 million from last year, primarily driven by increased earnings. And second, the full-year tax rate was 34.1%, compared to 35.1% in the year-ago period. This reflects the benefit of both the 2012 and 2013 research and development tax credit due to the retroactive reinstatement of credit -- of the credit in early 2013.","The summary for the full-year 2013 is on Slide 25. We had net income of $734 million in 2013, which was up 17.6% compared to 2012. The motorcycle segment operating income was up 21.7% compared to prior year. Strong motorcycle segment growth was driven by higher revenues, improved gross and operating margins and lower year-over-year restructuring expenses. As expected, HDFS income was down slightly during 2013 behind higher credit losses.","On Slide 26, you'll see our overall expectations for the year ahead. In 2014, we expect to ship 279,000 to 284,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 7% to 9% from 2013 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson motorcycles are strong. We expect shipping growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand; great model year 2014 and 2015 motorcycles; the introduction of the new Street motorcycles, which we estimate shipments of 7,000 to 10,000 units; continuing outreach momentum in the U.S.; and international expansion. During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 76,500 and 81,500 motorcycles, up approximately 2% to 8%, compared to last year's first quarter shipments of 75,222 motorcycles.","During the last several years, we have provided gross margin guidance given our focus on our restructuring activities that were largely aimed at improving our gross margin profitability. Since 2009, we have significantly improved gross margin from 32.3% to 35.4%. As we go forward, we will provide guidance on operating margin as a key financial metric rather than gross margin. We believe that operating margin will more appropriately capture our opportunities to leverage both gross margin and our investment in SG&A.","For 2014, we believe operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 17.5% and 18.5%, up from 16.6% in 2013. We believe 2014 operating margin will benefit from a modest increase in gross margin and from SG&A falling as a percent of revenue. Let's take a closer look at both. In terms of gross margin, we expect both puts and takes in 2014. On a positive side, we expect additional restructuring savings of approximately $10 million, plus about $8 million less in temporary inefficiencies than what we experienced in 2013. We also expect incremental margin behind higher production and lower pension expense. On the negative side, we expect headwinds to gross margin percent from mix, pricing and foreign currency exchange. As we have discussed, while we expect pressure on gross margin percent from mix and pricing, we expect both mix and pricing to positively impact 2014 gross dollar -- gross margin dollars.","Finally, we expect foreign exchange to have an adverse impact on both gross margin percent and dollars. As we look forward to the first quarter, we expect gross margin percent to be down slightly year-over-year due to start-up costs associated with the launch of our new Street motorcycles. We expect incremental start-up costs to impact both Q1 and Q2.","Looking forward at SG&A, we expect it will increase in 2014 as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect that it will decline as a percent of revenue as we leverage our current SG&A spending. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2014 compared to 2013. Capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to be between $215 million and $235 million. Finally, we expect full-year 2014 effective tax rate will increase to 35.5%. The increase is largely driven by the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2014.","So, to recap, we are certainly pleased with our fourth quarter results and key accomplishments throughout the year. During 2013, we successfully increased sales, gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in a 20.6% increase in diluted earnings per share; initiated flexible manufacturing at our York facility; completed restructuring activities started in 2009; launched one of the most significant new model years in our history; celebrated 110th anniversary around world; and delivered shareholder value through increase dividend of 35.5%; and the repurchase of $456 million in company's shares. We're excited about 2014, and we'll continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","I was hoping you could help us -- you talked a little bit about sort of the core versus outreach customers in 2013 being up. Some of that might have been a function of sort of the Project Rushmore bike not coming out until later in the year. How should we think about that in 2014? My general assumption is that Project Rushmore is the biggest thing you guys have going on, and that ultimately, you're focusing on the core first. So I'm assuming that, that will sort of reverse itself in '14. And I guess, specifically, how should we think about pricing in '14 on those bikes, and ultimately, mix?","John A. Olin","James, this is John. James, as Keith had mentioned in the preamble, we couldn't be more excited about our work on outreach sales. So for the year of 2013, we grew outreach at 7.2%, and our core customer at 3.1%, which again was over twice the rate, and the second time in 2 years. You mentioned the impact of Rushmore coming late in the model year. Again, this is all part of the fatten the tail strategy. On one end of the spectrum, is products like Rushmore that encourage trade-up at a high revenue and at a very high margin, and typically are aimed at our core customer. But I want to remind you that Rushmore is selling extremely well with outreach customers. And as we've talked in the past, motorcycles like the Street motorcycle is the #1 selling bike to women, young adults, African-American and Hispanic -- I'm sorry, Street Glide. And so we're seeing a tremendous amount of bikes being sold -- Rushmore bikes being sold to outreach as well.","Keith E. Wandell","This is Keith, James. I just want to add on here that our strategy is, and has been, to grow our outreach customers at a faster rate. We want to grow our core customers, but we just believe and have believed and continue to believe that we have a lot of opportunity with these underserved demographics, and also, internationally. And so, again, while Rushmore has been extremely popular with our outreach customers, Street Glide has been extremely popular. I just want to remind you that we focused only on the Harley-Davidson brand, all of our dollars and product development are being focused on the brand. We have a whole pipeline of products coming that are intended to not only solidify and grow our core customer base, but to bring new outreach customers into our dealerships in the years to come as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Larry, I'd like to ask you, have you seen any change in credit availability at either the prime or subprime levels? At reference, Carmax, for example, one of your peers in the financial space where subprime has tightened a little bit.","Lawrence G. Hund","I had seen that release on CarMax as well. I would say that we are seeing strong credit availability, particularly in the prime segment. I would say in the subprime segment, obviously, there's less availability, but we have not seen any pullback on competition in the subprime segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you talk, first of all, a little bit more about the -- thanks for the volume estimates for the Street 750 and 500. How are those positioned, such that they won't affect the Sportster and some of your other products? Do you feel that those would be largely accretive? And if I could just also ask for clarification on the margins -- the margin drivers. Can you give us some sense of how you're thinking about FX and commodities in terms of magnitude this year, just given some of the volatility we've seen recently?","John A. Olin","Great. Rod, this is John. With regards to the Street 500 and 750, again, as Keith had mentioned, we couldn't be more excited to be introducing these models in the second quarter. When we look at the overall pricing, in the U.S., the MSRP will be from $6,700 from the 500cc motorcycle to $7,500 for 750, a very attractive price point, and certainly considerably lower than Sportster. And Sportster's range anywhere from $8,000 to about $11,000. And even with a much lower MSRP, we're looking for ongoing gross margins of Street to be in line with our Sportster line. So we feel very good about the margins and certainly, the price point. Do we expect some cannibalization of Sportster? Yes, we would expect a little bit of cannibalization, especially of 883, but nothing all that great because of, again, the differential in the price point, as well as the type of bike and the attitude of the bike. Remember, this thing is designed for an urban environment and young adults. It's a Dark Custom, it will appeal to outreach customers. It's liquid cooled, which is very different with our new revolution x engine. So there'll be some cannibalization, but not to any great extent. I think then, Rod, you had asked about FX and raw materials. First of all, when we look in 2014 on raw materials, we would expect it to be largely flat on a year-over-year basis. We're not seeing any big moves in raw materials that would cause us concern at this point. And of course, we continue to monitor that. With regards to foreign currency, we do expect it to be unfavorable in 2014. And I believe that would be the third year of unfavorability in terms of foreign currency. And as you know, this year was quite painful in terms of foreign currency exchange. On a full-year basis it cost $39 million, and that was largely driven by significant devaluation of the yen, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real. So as we look forward, as we exit this year and the positions that we have on and the hedges that we have on, as well as where currencies are today, and the general expectation that the U.S. dollar will strengthen, we do expect foreign currency exchange to be unfavorable, both on a dollar basis, as well as affecting our gross margin percent in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things here. The gross margin, John, you alluded to the start-up costs related to the Street in the first half of the year. Should we interpret that to mean that the margins in the first half of the year potentially could be down a little bit, given all the other factors that you cited? And then the other piece here relates to cash flow. What's that minimum liquidity that you talk about, and above that, should we expect all free cash to be returned in dividends or share repo?","John A. Olin","Okay, Jim. When we look at that Street introduction, there will be incremental start-up costs associated with it. Remember, this is the first time we're introducing a product in 2 separate plants in the history of the company, and one of them will be international; the first time we're doing manufacturing outside the United States, an entirely new supply chain. There's a lot of things happening with this product that are going to drive some higher start-up costs, and those costs are going to hit in the first half. And so, what we can say is that we do expect first quarter gross margin percent to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, driven by those start-up costs. But again, once we get it up and running, we expect margins that look very similar to Sportster on a much lower revenue. In terms of overall cash flow and liquidity, as we've talked about, we are going to maintain 12 months of liquidity in terms of cash and committed credit facilities into 2014 and then in the foreseeable future. Anything beyond that, that we would deem as excess cash is coming back to our shareholders, and I think we've got a great track record over the last couple of years of delivering all that cash back. So when you look at our flows this year, we had $456 million go back in the form of dividend repurchases, $188 million in dividends, and then $175 million contribution to our pension plans. Now as we look to 2014, we clearly are not going to be funding the pension plan, so that will be additional excess cash to be returned to our shareholders or to pay down debt. So yes, all excess cash will come back to our shareholders, and again, with the reminder that we will be paying down the Buffet debt of $303 million here, and I believe the next week.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi Research.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of sales for 2014, your guidance, 79% increase, a little better than my estimate. And I'm just wondering, typically you provide more conservative guidance, and that growth rate is higher than you've typically guided in the past. Is it just due to the Street bikes? And could you have a little bit of cannibalization, and just kind of the other factors there. Because you have, I guess, in the second half, you have new model year 2015 products, what are you thinking of those? And then, to kind of look at the run rate of the fourth quarter going into next year, how much did weather really impact that 6% U.S. retail sales number, because obviously, every -- all the leisure vehicle companies have seen a pretty big impact from weather.","John A. Olin","Greg, we feel great about our guidance of 279,000 to 284,000. All I can say is that we believe we'll ship between those numbers. The drivers are the appeal of the brand. I don't think the brand has ever been stronger. The brand fundamentals are very strong. We've got Rushmore momentum coming in the model year '14 products. And yes, we're very excited about model year 2015 motorcycles. The Street adds a couple points of shipment margin under that 7% to 9%, and remember, the other thing about Street is that's just the initial rollout. It's only 5 markets this year, and we'll continue to roll it out over 2015. And then we've got some momentum in international business, and we're happy to see Europe start to turn the corner there, with 5% growth and especially, core Europe growing. So all those things make us very comfortable with our shipment guidance of 279,000 to 284,000 units. Your other question, Greg, was with regards to the fourth quarter, and overall retail sales in the fourth quarter, and were they impacted by weather. And it doesn't matter if you're a local market or in a big region, weather affects the timing of motorcycle sales. And so yes, we do believe that we were impacted by weather, but this is a business that we're in, and we're always going to see weather push sales. We don't think that we've lost any sales. We do think that they'll be pushed forward, but in particular, starting in the second month of -- second week of November, weather turned a little bit worse than a year ago levels, but again, we'll pick that volume up, and we feel good about where we're at. I think the bigger impact on our Q4 sales was really the Road Glide -- the absence of the Road Glide, which we completely expected, and that's going to provide some headwind with regards to retail sales as we go forward, as well as market share. And again, when you look at Q4 of 2012, Road Glide represented 9% of that volume, and that Road Glide customers are incredibly loyal to that motorcycle. It is different; it's a different design, it's a different look and a different ride. And so they -- knowing that, that -- those models are going to come back with Rushmore features, we believe that they're out of the market, and that's probably the biggest impact that we had on our retail sales in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just looking -- with this being, I think, the first year of kind of OpEx\/SG&A with fairly minimal restructuring charges in it compared to history, I think it came in somewhere around 18.9%, 19%. If you look back historically, the last time you kind of recorded a year where you had similar levels of revenue that SG&A\/OpEx number was, of course, lower in the 15s. And I understand that it probably costs more to sell a bike now than it did back then, but could you, A, maybe just give us a sense of what the structural differences are in the business now? And then maybe a little bit more about the longer-term opportunity to leverage that down because it does look like it's a potential margin opportunity even beyond 2014.","John A. Olin","Pat, so overall, SG&A, let's start with the fact that it represents -- it's about 80% fixed. But that doesn't mean that it isn't subject to inflation because it certainly is. But when we look at our motorcycle growth and revenue growth, the SG&A base is highly leverageable. Again, about 80% fixed, 20% is more variable and more directly tied to motorcycle sales. So as we look forward, I mean there's a tremendous opportunity to leverage that base of SG&A spending, and that's why we did move from guidance to add gross margin to operating margin. We want to make sure our investors, as well as our employees, are focused on that opportunity. I don't know when you go back and look over time, you'd asked about SG&A because there was inflationary pressures, and also, the big investment we've made over the last 3 years in our international expansion have pushed SG&A up. But again, a lot of that footprint is set from an international perspective, and we expect to leverage that with international growth exceeding our domestic growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with MorningStar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about how you're thinking about pushing price increases through, going forward, particularly overseas, and maybe what you're seeing in way of competitive environment over there promotionally?","John A. Olin","Jaime, this is John. We actually don't think about it as pushing price increases through. We think about more of delivering value to our customers that they're willing to pay for, and I think Rushmore is a great example of that. We're able to increase -- well, drive the entire line of pricing at 3.5% in model year 2014, certainly more of a larger price increase of about 5% on our Touring motorcycles. And it was delivering an incredible amount of value, because we know our customers better than anyone else in the world, and we'll continue to do that. We think that the brand gives us a lot of opportunity and pricing power as we go forward, but I think the pricing opportunities are going to be driven by the life cycle plan that we have in design. And the models that we're going to be bringing forward will allow us to continue to increase our prices behind the value that we deliver. I'm sorry, the other question was competitive environment internationally. We feel great about opportunities to expand our business internationally. We certainly had some headwinds in Europe, and this quarter represents the best growth that we had in Europe in the last 11 quarters. So hopefully, we'll see Europe economically get better. We do expect some up-and-down quarters there, but that's really where we've had the most pressure in terms of a competitive standpoint, and even within Europe we've been -- the team has done a great job at growing market share, and grew a significant amount of share in 2013. So the rest of our focus internationally is really through building the distribution network and building the brand internationally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In U.S. you gained 2 points a share in the third quarter without the road glide. Now you're down about 3% in the fourth quarter. Can you just discuss other factors that may have impacted share, perhaps talk about the competitive environment, products and promotion and do you anticipate gaining U.S. share in 2014?","John A. Olin","Gerrick, in Q4, we did lose some market share. And as we talked about at the Investor Day back in August, we expected that we would be given back some market share. So there was 3 drivers of the market share in the third quarter. First was, similar to retail sales, when you look at the company, the comp was a little bit tougher in the fourth quarter. On a year-ago basis, we lost share in the third quarter of 2012 because of the fact that we're putting in the ERP system, and we pushed volume out of that quarter into the fourth quarter, so that was part of what we were comparing against. The biggest driver though of share loss in the fourth quarter was the absence of Road Glide. And again, when you have a year-ago product that sold 9% of your total U.S. volume, and we no longer have those models in the lineup, and this year is the comparable and we believe the loyalty of those customers we'll have them out of the market until we reintroduced that product, that was the largest impact of the share loss. And then also, during the quarter, we had increased competitive activity. As we look forward to 2014, we would expect headwinds in terms of market share for the next couple of quarters, in particular, due to the absence of Road Glide.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, and you gave great color on your prepared remarks, so I appreciate that. Just to stick on this market share commentary, just wondering if you could touch upon what you're seeing from your newest competitor, Indian, as they've been ramping, and do you see that as being a bit of a headwind to some of your market share improvement? Or is it all the -- just a return of the Road Glide? Maybe if you -- I don't know if you can calculate this, but maybe if you could give us some kind of guesstimate of what your market share might have been, kind of adjusting for the Road Glide or normalizing for the absence of that?","John A. Olin","Felicia, it's John. Let's start with the last one first. We're not going to speculate on what market share would have been had the Road Glide been in there, but just to suffice to say that it was a huge part of our sales in 2012, and it's no longer there. When we look at Indian, they sold some motorcycles in the fourth quarter. We expected that. They've been out of business for quite sometime and Polaris has been promoting them heavily. So they sold some motorcycles, but nothing outside our expectations at all. So it's what we expected. It hasn't thrown us off our plan at all. We'll see how they continue to roll out. I would imagine a lot of that was driving the overall category up and the new people coming in picking up a nostalgic bike, but it's going to take some time to understand where everything nets out, but everything is well within our expectations.","Keith E. Wandell","And Felicia, this is Keith. I'll just add that as we sat back and look at these numbers here sort of as a leadership team, we have to remember that we did gain a full point of market share this year, and that was our fifth consecutive year. And over the last 5 years, the market share has increased 13.4%, and we're at all-time high market share numbers in our company now. Having said that, we take every one of our competitors seriously. And clearly, Indian has targeted Harley-Davidson, but so has Honda and so has Suzuki and Yamaha and other companies over the years as well. And so while we monitor that regularly, we take all of our competitors seriously, what we've done here is we've transformed our company, and we've also transformed the culture in our company and how our employees think. And none of our employees take our market share leadership for granted. None of our employees think that we're great, but they all know that we're on a journey to be great. And so everything that we do in our company, everything that we've done, every ounce of energy that collectively we've put into our company in the last several years has been all about designing and developing and bringing great new products to market, which you're beginning to see, and there's more to come. It's been about manufacturing in a great way. We -- our plant in York, Pennsylvania -- the transformation that took place in that plant in less than 4 years is unbelievable. We were just awarded one of the Industry Week's Best Plants in America. And it's really an example of what we can do -- an American manufacturing to be competitive and provide great, world-class products and export freedom around the world. So -- and so that's what we're all about, and our dealers are all in. Our dealers are stepping up their game in terms of providing great customer experiences every day that are personalized, that are trusted and that are social. And so, we're -- we got our eyes straight ahead, right? We're not looking back, and we think that we're going to be able to compete very well.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on pricing for both of used and your expectation of new. You mentioned that you're seeing some lower recoveries within HDFS, with the Rushmore success. I'm just wondering is that, A, is one of the expectations and, whether there's any commentary of the overall environment for your used bikes. And then on the pricing comment, the guidance. I think you said price mix would be positive for dollars, but negative for margin. If you were to isolate pricing, specifically, is that also the case that it would be negative for margin? And if so, I was just wondering is that because you expect content to be higher? Just a bit more color there.","John A. Olin","Jonas, I'll start with the second question first. In terms of pricing, this really is driven largely by the model year '14 pricing in which we increased our overall revenue across all the lines, across all the regions by about 3.5%. When you look at the gross margin piece of that that increased at a slightly faster rate. It increased at 4-point -- the cost increased at 4.2%. So what that cascades down to is gross margin growth of about 2.1%. So we had higher revenue and certainly higher margins and higher dollar profits. But when you look at that content growing at a little -- with our cost of goods sold growing little bit faster rate than revenue, we did see a headwind on gross margin percent by about 0.05 point and we feel that was the right thing to do for our shareholder, and to drive shareholder value, and make sure that we didn't over price the motorcycles. They've got a tremendous amount of content, but there are some stiff increases in there of up to about $1,800 on some of the models. So we want to digest that, and again, as we mentioned earlier, we think that we have pricing power as we move into the future, which you're absolutely right. Is dollar profit in revenues accretive due to our pricing actions and we'll be slightly -- so slight headwind to overall gross margin percent.","Lawrence G. Hund","And Jonas, this is Larry. Just adding on what you said about used. Not surprisingly, I think with the great introduction of Rushmore, and all the content, those motorcycles have, number one, dealers are taking a fair amount of trades when selling those new motorcycles. That has meant they have not had to go to the auctions quite as much for their used motorcycle source. And this has put a little bit downward pressure on recovery values. Also some downward pressure probably on used motorcycle prices.","Amy Giuffre","Okay, thanks, gentlemen, thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us today and this morning.

Just to note a key major of financial performance, the 39.1% gross margin percentage that we reported this morning is the highest in at least the last 15 years.","We are the undeniable market leader in the 601cc-plus segment of the motorcycle market with a broad and outstanding line of products and retail motorcycle sales six times those of the nearest competitor in the U.S. The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength that we've built over many decades.","We've got incredible breadth and depth in our retail distribution and a compelling strategy that's focused on growing our reach to new customers in the U.S. growing internationally and continuously improving every aspect of how we operate.","As we noted in today's press release, we now have the breakout of Harley-Davidson's market share for 2014 by demographic group. And for the seventh straight year, we remain the number one seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to each of the demographic groups that we track, both in the 601cc-plus segment and across on-road motorcycles of all displacements.","Turning to international markets, while some parts of Europe were affected by currency and soft economic conditions in the first quarter, other parts of the EMEA region did well. For example, it was our best quarter ever in our Central, Eastern and Southeastern European markets as well as South Africa.","In Asia-Pacific, we had our strongest quarter ever in India and China, as well as exceptional initial demand for the Street 750 in Korea, Vietnam and Thailand. And Street is doing very well in its initial rollout in Australia and New Zealand, among others. In Latin America, sales were up double-digits in Mexico with about half of the increase coming from the Street 750. Clearly, Street is hitting the mark.","I also want to touch on some recognition Harley-Davidson has received in recent weeks. We're placed in the top 10 in the Forbes ranking of top employers in America based on a national survey of more than 20,000 employees at U.S. companies.","And on the brand side, we were named 2015 Motorcycle Brand of the Year in the EquiTrend, Harris Poll annual study of brands that's based on familiarity, quality and consideration. I mentioned these as a reflection of the passion and dedication of our workforce as well as the power of our brand. Our team's many accomplishments during my time here demonstrate the power of our strategy and being customer-led and I couldn't be more proud of everyone. And I personally believe Harley-Davidson's best days are yet to come.","Harley-Davidson has a remarkable leader in Matt Levatich as its next CEO. Matt has an outstanding track record. He knows this business in and out and has been a driving force behind our strategy with the vision to take Harley-Davidson to great places.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Matt.","Matthew S. Levatich - President And Chief Operating Officer, Harley-Davidson Motor Company","Thank you, Keith. I don't want to take too much time because I know there's a lot to get to and I'll be talking with many of you again in the coming days and weeks. I do want to take this opportunity, though, to thank Keith for his inspired leadership. Keith has always been too modest to take credit for returning Harley-Davidson to strength, establishing a culture of leadership and charting a clear vision and strategy for the future. But everyone associated with this company will continue to be inspired by his tremendous contributions. And we all have great confidence in the future for our position of strength and industry leadership.","In his comments, Keith touched on a few of Harley's many strengths, from an incredibly talented and passionate employees and our powerful global dealer network to our brand and industry leadership, our manufacturing, product development and retail prowess, our increasingly diverse customer base, and, of course, our unrivaled motorcycles.","We've been in the motorcycle business continuously through all the many ups and downs for 112 years. For the last six, we've built on our strengths and taken our capabilities to a whole new level, with agility to perform in a world and marketplace that is more dynamic and complex than ever.","While our business and industry will always have challenges, Harley-Davidson also has incredible opportunities. We have a clear and compelling strategy and we're running this business for long-term performance. That means, keeping on the throttle to further leverage our strong product development and manufacturing capabilities even as we increasingly focus on maximizing our potential at retail to grow internationally and to further broaden our reach with new customers here in the United States.","As good as we may be today, we know we can build on our many strengths to be that much better tomorrow.","So thank you and now here's John with the details on the quarter.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Keith and Matt. Before I get into the details, I'd like to take a minute to thank Keith for his service to this great company. I will personally miss Keith a ton. I would also like to congratulate Matt on his new role. There is not a better person or a more capable leader to take Harley-Davidson into the future, a very exciting future filled with great opportunity.","Now, let's discuss our first quarter financial results starting on slide 13. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.67 billion, net income in the quarter was $269.9 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.27. Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was $345.5 million, slightly lower than last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was down 3.9% behind significantly unfavorable currency exchange and lower year-over-year shipments.","Despite the lower revenue, the Motorcycle business operating margin was up 0.8 percentage points, driven by a higher gross margin percent and flat year-over-year SG&A spending. Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 2.3% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had an lower effective tax rate. We continue to focus on delivering strong margins, strong returns over the long term.","Now, let's take a closer look at first quarter performance starting with retail sales on slide 14. Q1 was a tough quarter with worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles, down 1.3% compared to last year's increase of 5.8%. Retail sales were soft in both the U.S. and several international regions during the quarter. First quarter worldwide retail sales continued to reflect an outstanding consumer response to our new models including Street which sold very well in the initial rollout markets and in new markets which were added throughout the quarter.","In the U.S., retail sales were impacted by increased competitive price discounting. The year-over-year comparison also reflects lapping the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore models. Internationally, sales were mainly impacted by lapping last year's favorable weather throughout Europe and also lapping the significant pull-forward of sales in Japan in advance of the April 2014 consumption tax increase.","As we exited the first quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. However, in the near term, our U.S. business is under pressure from increased, very aggressive competitive discounting, enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. Consequently, we believe it is prudent to adjust our shipment plan for the full year. We now expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles worldwide, which represents growth of approximately 2% to 4% versus prior year.","Our previous guidance was 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to support a healthy retail channel and protect our premium brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand as we have consistently done over the past several years. Going forward, we expect continued success as we execute our long-term growth strategies. We remain very confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead.","Let's take a look at U.S. market on slide 15. First quarter retail sales in the U.S. fell short of our expectations, down 0.7% compared to the prior year. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales growth during the quarter were: first, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q1 2014 retail sales of non-Road Glide Touring motorcycles were up a very strong 35% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q1 2015. Second, we experienced adverse weather conditions in certain regions of the U.S., and finally, continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition, which increased from Q4 2014 and was up significantly compared to last year's first quarter.","Given the levels of competitive inventories in the retail channel coupled with foreign exchange that was favorable for our competitors, we expect aggressive discounting from the competition will continue for some time as they work through what we believe to be excessive retail inventory. Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success with our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street 750 sales continue to drive our performance in the small cruiser segment, which grew double digits on a year-over-year basis.","During the quarter, the industry grew 9.0%. We had a very strong market share of 51.3%. We believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter bodes well for motorcycling. However, our share was down 4.7 points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share in Q1 2015 was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of increased price discounting by the competition.","This is not the first time we've experienced period of extreme discounting by our competitors and likely won't be the last. However, we will continue to protect our premium brand. We will not take a short-term view of the current competitive situation and compete by discounting. We will continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long term.","We continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and ship to the low end of our guidance. At the end of the first quarter, U.S. retail inventory was up 6,600 units on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to Street dealer fill, but also higher than expected due to soft retail sales in the quarter.","On slide 16, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.4% in the first quarter as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales growth of 10.9%. In our EMEA region, Q1 retail sales were down 5.6%, driven by lapping last year's very favorable weather conditions across Europe, current soft economic conditions in some markets, and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we do not sell in local currencies, such as in Russia. Europe market share in Q1 was 9.8%, down 1.5 percentage points behind the introduction of several low-priced models by the competition.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were down 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline was entirely driven by the lapping of year-ago retail sales growth of 33.1% in Japan as sales were pulled forward in advance of the consumption tax increase in April 2014. Excluding Japan, Q1 retail sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up nearly 20%. Emerging markets within the region, especially India and China, continue to post very strong growth.","Latin America region retail sales were up slightly in the quarter as a result of strong growth in Mexico, largely offset by soft retail sales in Brazil. Retail sales in Brazil have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 5.7% in the first quarter as we lapped currency-driven pricing actions initiated last year by our distributor.","While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize strong international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders.","On slide 17, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 1.4% compared to last year. First quarter shipments finished near the low end of our expected range of 79,000 to 84,000 motorcycles as we manage supply in line with lower-than-expected retail sales.","During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.9 percentage points from the prior year as Rushmore models continued to be in high demand. Also during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 2.8 percentage points, reflecting our shipments of Street motorcycles in the quarter. Q1 2015 international shipments as a percent of total were 28.8%. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years.","On slide 18, you'll see revenue from the motorcycle and related products segment was down in the first quarter, driven by unfavorable currency exchange and a 1.4% decrease in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $405 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing.","On average, our key currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 14% compared to Q1 2014. During the quarter, we took an off-model year price increase of 1.2% in Europe to help mitigate the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange in that region. Parts and accessory revenue was down 7.2% in the first quarter, primarily driven by unfavorable currency exchange. General merchandise revenue was up 3.6% in the quarter.","On slide 19, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.1%, which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed very well with price, mix, raw materials and manufacturing all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable volume and foreign currency exchange.","During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $9.1 million, largely driven by a rich sales mix of parts and accessories and general merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin, driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was also slightly unfavorable to prior year.","Foreign currency exchange was $39.5 million unfavorable for the first quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 8% from the beginning to the end of the quarter and were 14% weaker compared to the prior-year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign-denominated assets on the balance sheet. We are very pleased with our Q1 2015 gross margin percent growth. The record Q1 gross margin performance evidences that the underlying margin structure of the company is very strong. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations.","On slide 20, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 22.9%, up 0.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. Operating income of $345.5 million was down $2.2 million versus the prior year, driven by slightly unfavorable gross margin dollars and relatively flat SG&A spending. We were very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating margin as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","Now, moving on to our Financial Services segment on slide 21. In the first quarter, HDFS's operating profits increased $1.5 million or 2.3% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were: first, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $4.4 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $5.4 million due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in the reserve rate. Finally, HDFS had a strong increase in insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the first quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remained very profitable with industry-leading returns.","Now, let's take a look at HDFS's operations on slide 22. During the first quarter, HDFS's retail motorcycle loan originations increased 3.2% or $19.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.3 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the first quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed per motor cycle. Finance receivables outstanding increased 6.6% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in the prime and subprime segments. In Q1 2015, approximately 80% of our new motorcycle loan originations were prime.","Moving onto credit performance on slide 23. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at March 31 was 2.64% or two basis points lower than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continue to perform at record low levels.","Annual retail credit losses increased by 23 basis points to 1.56% compared to last year's first quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime originations in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior. During the first quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position, delivered solid credit performance and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc.","Now, let's take a look at cash and liquidity on slide 24. You will see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.23 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.88 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the first quarter, we successfully completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We also completed a $600-million five-year medium term note offering with a coupon of 2.15%. Additionally, in the first quarter, HDFS paid a $100 million dividend to HD Inc.","We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.9 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $182.5 million during the quarter. Returning values to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.","Now, I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on slide 25. I'd like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $174.7 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was down $28.9 million from last year, driven by higher working capital and higher wholesale finance originations. And second, first quarter tax rate was 34.4% compared to 35.0% in a year-ago period.","On slide 26, you'll see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we now expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 2% to 4% from 2014 shipments, but approximately 6,000 fewer motorcycles than prior guidance. We believe it is prudent to adjust our plan at this time given the increased aggressive price discounting that is occurring in the U.S. market.","We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson motorcycles remain strong despite the aggressive competitive discounting that is occurring. We are committed to protecting our premium brand and will keep our focus on the long-term sustainability of our business. During the second quarter, we expect to ship 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 5% to 10% compared to last year's second quarter shipments.","For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be flat to up modestly compared to 2014, impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense and unfavorable mix.","To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full-year motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%, one percentage point worse than we anticipated on our January call as currencies continued to devalue during the quarter. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year.","Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange impact to be considerably worse than the first quarter's $39.5 million reduction. Assuming yesterday's exchange rates hold for the entire quarter, we would expect second quarter revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5%, with approximately 60% of the revenue decline adversely impacting second quarter's gross margin dollars.","We believe second quarter gross margin will be down approximately 2.5 percentage points versus last year's gross margin percent, driven by unfavorable currency, lower production as we adjust to lower shipment expectations and unfavorable mix during the quarter compared to last year. Looking at SG&A, we now expect spending to be flat to down in 2015 as we work to mitigate the adverse impact of lower revenues. In addition, we continue to expect that SG&A will decline as a percent of revenue.","For HDFS, we can \u2013 we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million and $260 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market, and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015.","So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant price discounting in the U.S., we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the quarter. We successfully increased gross and operating margin percent, continued to grow outreach in excess of two times our core customer growth in the U.S., expanded distribution of Street into many new international markets, expanded our international dealer network and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of $183 million in company shares.","For the remainder of 2015, we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Keith, best wishes from all of us at Baird. First question here, and I'll leave it at one, is on the buyback. I know you've worked very hard to rebuild the balance sheet. But with the stock under pressure, would you consider adding a turn or two of leverage in order to accelerate the buyback plan that you already have in place?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Craig. This is John. We would consider that and the strategy has been to, first, repair our credit ratings, which now we're \u2013 are sitting at two AA minuses and an A. But that is something that we would consider as we move forward.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And how much leverage, John, would you consider?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Craig, that's something that we wouldn't discuss at this time.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. So, a question on the competitive dynamic, which you mentioned last quarter as well. I don't recall the last quarter you mentioned currency as being one of the dynamics behind the competitive discounting. So, maybe you could help us think about anytime historically where you've seen competitors use currency to their advantage and kind of the length that that's lasted and then how you assess the risk of really not responding versus the peer group. And then, secondarily, just a quick question on Europe. Just wondering if there was any negative reaction to the price increase there?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. The first question, Sharon, is have we seen other times? In particular, when you look back over about the last 15 years, there's two times in which Harley-Davidson lost share largely due to competitive discounting. That was in 2000 and 2008. Now, in 2000, by 2002, market share was back. And we lost about three points in both cases in 2000 and 2008. And in 2008, we lost three points of market share. And then in 2009, we gained back 8.5 points. So, this has happened before. We expect it to happen again.","And the way that we've managed it is the way we've always managed our great premium brand is that we're not going to jump in and respond to price discounting by discounting on our \u2013 discounting our great brand. We're managing this for the long-term value of the brand and the company and suck industry profits out of it by lowering margin and selling non-full margin product is not the way to do it.","Again and history shows that market share will come back in a short period of time. So, we're going to continue to manage this thing for the long term and do what's right for the brand overall.","In terms of, I think, your third question, Sharon, was on Europe. And the price increase took effect about a month ago. It was 1.2% given the overall devaluation in Europe, which is significantly more than that. We're balancing that with a competitive set there, and we have not seen any \u2013 not long enough to get a read on any impact of the price increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning and, Keith, I'd also like to add congratulations. It's been a pleasure working with you and I hope you enjoy your next chapter. So, just a few questions. One is just trying to get some more granularity on the guidance reduction. I'm just wondering, is guidance cut more of a proactive move or is it more reactive to something you're seeing so far now? I mean, I know you've given a lot of color about the competition and why you're doing it. But, again, reactive, proactive. That would be helpful.","And then also, you did give some color about this and how you're planning on offsetting the pressures of the deleveraging effect of lower unit sales and effects on gross margins. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically about the efficiencies that you're enjoying there to help offset some of that. And then just finally, now you're back-half-loaded pretty significantly, so what gives you your confidence in that? Thank you.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Felicia. The guidance reduction \u2013 the first question was with regards to the guidance reduction. Is it proactive or reactive? You know, we had \u2013 we'd called out in the fourth quarter that we saw the competitive discounting increase quite dramatically in the fourth quarter. And at that time, we said two-thirds of our competition had stepped it up. We were seeing discounts up to $2,000.","Well, as we move in to the first quarter, we are seeing a couple things happen from what we saw in the first quarter. Both the depths and the breadths of the discounting has increased quite significantly from the fourth quarter. We're seeing discounts now up to $3,000 a bike. We're also seeing our competition reprice with lower MSRPs, some cases, up to 25%.","And so, with that, to answer your question, it is both reactive and proactive. We do expect that this is more of a fundamental change. There's excess inventory in the channel and there's a newfound money by our competition, which is largely Japanese and European competitors that have seen their economics shift quite dramatically in the last three quarters, so we believe that price discounting will continue for a few to several more quarters, and therefore we're certainly being proactive because we're not going to discount and what we're going to is take down our volume.","We're going to continue to invest in the equity side of the business and build in the brand and the lifestyle aspects of it, but we're not going to participate in discounting. So we're lowering our volumes, 6,000 units, and going to continue to sell full-margin motorcycles as we move into the future. So a little bit reactive on what we've lost in the first quarter, but much more proactive on what we expect over the next couple quarters.","The next question you had asked is about the efficiencies. So thanks for asking that, don't want it to go unnoticed that we had a record gross margin in the first quarter, 39.1%, which was up 1.4 percentage points and that's despite a currency headwind of what amounted to 1 point, 2 points of gross margin. So we couldn't be more pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our margin structure and how things are proceeding.","A lot of that is driven in the manufacturing line item and the plants are running very well. Continuous improvement here is an everyday thing, and we continue to find ways to take costs out of the business and to drive things forward. We talked about our pricing and our ability to price, and that's driving a lot of the favorability in the quarter as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So if we just do the math on your numbers versus the heavyweight industry, it suggests everybody else is up about 22%. I guess, first, how is that possible? Presumably, you've seen the MIC numbers. I'm assuming that the vast majority of that is Japanese players. I guess help us understand who's being the most promotional. And, I guess, secondarily, how that's impacting your model lineup? Is it primarily the lower-end bikes that are getting beaten up by some of this promotional activity given the types of bikes that are being discounted, and are the entirety of your share losses to other manufacturers who are discounting? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great. Great question. And so, in the first quarter, in the quarter where weather was worse on a year-over-year basis, you're right, James, we saw our competition up about 20%. How is that possible? It's possible with an incredible amount of money coming into the category and lowering the average prices of motorcycles. Again, discounts up to $3,000, re-pricing MSRP, that's the only way it's possible. And, yes, we're seeing the share loss come predominantly to price discounters, mainly the Japanese. And, again, we've experienced this in the past. We'll experience it in the future.","When you looked at what they're doing, and kind of, again, a difference from the fourth quarter to what we're seeing now, is in the fourth quarter, they predominantly were discounting model \u2013 old model year products, so 2014, 2013 and 2012's. Now we're seeing a migration to discounting of more current model year product, again, leading us to believe that this is going to be a few quarters out that it will continue.","We are seeing the discounting across everything. And it's not only the categories which we compete in, which are our Touring and Cruiser segments, but also we're seeing it in performance bikes, we're seeing it in dual, and we're seeing it in standard. So, it is pretty pervasive. When you look at where it's hitting the hardest in terms of Harley-Davidson, that would be in the large cruiser segment. And again, to give an example of dimensionalize it, if you look at the large cruiser segment, where we have our Softails, Dynas and V-Rods competing, the competition grew that segment about 70% in the first quarter. And again, that doesn't happen in a mature category without a shock to it. And that is the favorability that they are receiving on foreign exchange being spent in that way.","Operator","As a reminder, limit your questions to one question. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. First of all, Keith, thank you for everything, contributing to the company and best of wishes on your retirement, Sir. John, just to follow on to the previous question. As you said, we've seen this discounting in the past. And Harley has rebounded from it. From what we hear from the dealers though also, it would appear that within the Custom category and especially the Sportster category, it's a matter of those products being a little longer in the tooth. You guys have done a lot of innovation obviously in the touring with the Street. But you can't do everything at once. But it would seem that the Sportster and the Custom are little long in the tooth. Could the combination of that and the discounting be the root of the issue here? And then again, maybe as you guys bring innovation as you've done in the past, that could help turn the tide here.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Tim, the root of the issue is the discounting. We're always focused on product. We got a great product lineup over the next several years. And we're going to continue to execute it. But what we're seeing in the near term is an incredible amount of money coming in and reducing prices in the short term. And again, we have been through this before, our brand and our brand power will get through it again, and it is all about the discounting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I hate to beat a dead horse on the products side, but I also have some questions just following up on that. Really two specifically \u2013 I should know this, but I don't. The Japanese competitors, do they manufacture at all in the United States or is this entirely kind of a transactional benefit that they're getting from importing bikes? And my follow-up question is, is there also a new product angle on this? I feel like there have been some refreshes at the competition, Honda and Yamaha recently. Is that correct and is that having an impact as well?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Patrick. There is no manufacturing in the U.S. by the Japanese or our European competitors. In terms of new products, there are some new products out there, but that's not the driver. The driver is clearly the discounting that's going on. There's no significant new products from certainly our Japanese or our European competitors that are driving market share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian. Your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So just a question for Matt. I'm just wondering if there is any changes in terms of the near-term or long-term strategy that you plan to implement once at the helm.","Matthew S. Levatich - President And Chief Operating Officer, Harley-Davidson Motor Company","Yeah. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, one of the great things that we have in the company is a very clear and compelling strategy, and whole organization is focused on executing, as John has pointed out. So clearly, we have some headwinds in the business that we're going to have to deal with and that will bring more focus and energy to the areas where we can best impact that, but as far as the strategy and our direction, we're doubling down and accelerating on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. The first question would just be, can you just provide a little bit more color on what gives you confidence for that big implied ramp in the back half of the year on the shipments?","And then the second and related to some of the challenges you faced earlier, one of the things we've picked up on is a big discrepancy between some of those dealers in the north and dealers in the south and the dealers in the south actually I think reported some pretty decent performance. So I'm wondering if there's a product mix issue there versus the competition where some of those, some of your product weighed a little bit more in the south that caused you to lose share. And as the northern weather warms up, we're going to see any of this abate.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joe. So, the shipment ramp in the second quarter, so let's kind of run through where we're at. Where shipments were down 1.4% in the first quarter, our guidance for 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles in the second quarter is down 5% to 10%. So, if you work that math out, you're down about 3% to 6% in the first half, which has an implied growth in the back half of about 16% on average. So, we are backloading the second half, the reason being is all of the, basically, the 6,000 units are coming out, we're taking out in the second quarter, another opportunity to exercise our flexible manufacturing.","If you remember a year ago in the second quarter, weather was very difficult and we ended up with higher inventories than we had wanted at the end of the second quarter. And we fixed that in the third quarter. And at this point, we will bring inventories down in the second quarter. So, taking the $6,000 guidance reduction out in the second quarter and fixing inventories or bringing inventories where they should be at the end of the second quarter requires us to have more shipments in the back half. We feel very comfortable with that split. And, again, as we've always said and we've certainly demonstrated, we're going to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and make sure that the marketplace is clean as we move forward.","The second question that you had, Joe, is with regards to the north and the south and weather and so on and so forth, if you look at \u2013 the overall weather from the weather services was pretty even on a year-over-year basis, both in terms of average temperature and precipitation. But when you look at it, this winter was a harder first quarter than last year because of the timing of when the weather hit and certainly the excess of snowfall in the northeast.","We have seven sales region and of those, seven three of them were down considerably. That represent about 40% of our volume, and the Northeast being down the most, which was down double digits. Now, in the areas that didn't have the weather issues, sales were very strong, and we feel great about where we're at. And that was led by the West, which was up double digits. And that's a second year in a row that the first quarter was up over double digits in the West. So, again, it was clearly a weather issue. It was not a product or mix or the inventories that we had in those markets or uneven competition. It was clearly the weather.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. I have two questions. First, on FX. You mentioned there was a $35.5 million net impact to gross margin. But could you explain what happened to the top line? And then also, if there might have been a positive to cost of goods sold from production, in, say, Brazil, India, sourcing in Japan? And secondarily, when you do talk about competitive pricing, it seems like you're only referring to the foreign competitors. But are you also talking about Indian, they had a $1,000 off if you traded in a Harley. Do you think you're seeing some impact from that? Because I honestly think you'd probably see more of an impact from Indian as opposed to the Japanese, just my two cents.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gerrick. So, the first question was to expound upon a little bit more on the currency in the quarter. So, what we had at the top line, our revenue was impacted by $53.8 million. And that was that 14% devaluation, which is the average exchange rates between the first quarter of this year versus last year. And so with revenue down $53.8 million, which is equivalent to 3.5%, we did have a pickup in cost of goods sold of $14.3 million. And that was a result of the natural hedges that we have. So, some of our parts that we make motorcycles in the United States would come from foreign markets. And so, there's a natural hedge there, and then also financial hedges that we had.","But those two gains were largely offset by the revaluation of our assets. So, we have to look and we mark our assets from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. There was an 8% devaluation within the quarter, and that generated a significant loss on the revaluation of those assets. Now, that's more of a one-time loss and then will reverse itself when the currencies come back, but that minimized the impact of those hedges. Therefore, that drove the $39.5 million hit to gross margin, which equated to one point, two points of gross margin and about $0.10 of earnings per share.","The other question that you had asked is with regards to competitive pricing. Yes. We're well aware that Indian is discounting a fair amount as well. Most of the conversations that we've had has been currency-driven discounting. But all of our competitors, or most every competitor, is discounting including Indian, and they're at probably similar levels to the Japanese in a lot of respects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody. So we get the message loud and clear that you're not going to keep up with the discounting. You're going to protect the brand for the long term. That's great. But I think you also alluded to doing some other things with the ownership experience or perhaps some other non-discounting items that could help continued engagement and give your rider community reasons not to switch, because it seems like these discounts are frankly working really well. So, could you elaborate on what those things are? What those other non-price efforts are, and how much they could be a burden near term on results this year? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Adam. What we think the burden is is 6,000 units and that's what we're taking out of our guidance. We are doing things. In the first half we've stepped up some of our advertising. We've got a young adult campaign going on and a competitive core customer campaign going on; and also to work to mitigate it, we've taken pricing action in Europe and you're looking at actions in Canada as well. So, again, we're going to continue to do what has made our brand great in the past and continue to invest in that brand, but not tear it down by discounting it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I had two questions. One, is there anything specific that you can point to on the manufacturing side that drove that $19 million positive and should that continue? Any additional commentary there? And then secondly, if the currencies stay where they are, you said that would be about a 4.25% impact on revenues, so about $240 million headwind on the motorcycle business.","And presumably that would be where the earnings impact would be if you didn't have these hedges. You indicated about a 50% pass through, so $120 million. But it sounds like, based on your guidance, you're seeing about $95 million in the first half, which leaves only about $25 million in the back half. I'm wondering whether I'm misinterpreting what you're saying or whether that's correct.","Keith E. Wandell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Rod, the first question is, is the manufacturing, is there anything in particular? Again, as I had mentioned, the ongoing continuous improvement, the way we're operating the plants is all going very well. There is a one-time that we're lapping in our manufacturing expense, and that's the Street start-up costs. If you will remember a year ago, we had a fair amount of start-up cost with Street. That was about $4.7 million, $5 million. And so, we are lapping that. So that would provide some of that benefit that we saw in manufacturing. But that's the core level of profitability, and we're just lapping that piece of it.","On the second question that you had is with regards to our full-year guidance in terms of revenue, 4.25%. You had used the number of $240 million. We won't comment on that, but 50% of it will fall down and hit gross margin in an adverse fashion. We'll pick up some of that in SG&A.","The question that you asked is with regards to the magnitude of I guess the first half revenue hit and gross margin hit versus the back half. And the worst quarter that we're going to have, if everything again remains constant, is the second quarter. And that's because a year ago our foreign currencies were the strongest in the second quarter, and then we saw late in the third quarter that the currency started to devalue, so we'll be lapping that as we get toward the end of the year. So, yes, you're right, the biggest magnitude of impact of foreign currency will be in the first half of the year, and more specifically in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Just couple questions on the international side of the business. Can you just talk a little bit about dealer inventories internationally and where those stand? And it sounds as though the price competition might be global, but if you could just address that and confirm that if that's accurate?","And then just finally on the finance business, how much international is in your finance portfolio? And are there any concerns that we should have with respect to change in the threshold at which you're granting credit?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, David. The first question is international dealer inventory have been pretty consistent on a year-over-year basis. But international is on a different inventory system. Our dealers pull \u2013 when they sell one they pull one. We call it pipeline. So inventory is more company-owned internationally than dealer-owned. And we have very little change in dealer inventories from period to period just because of the way that we supply our dealer network. And any inventories would be more company-owned inventories as they fluctuate up and down. So, inventories are just different than in the United States where we push the inventory out to the dealers after we manufacture them.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Got it.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Second question, is price competition global. No, we're not seeing global price competition. Our competitors are largely Japanese and European. They're certainly realizing a strong benefit when they sell in the United States. But otherwise, we're not seeing any huge price competition outside of Brazil in our foreign markets.","The final question was, is the percent of revenue at HDFS, should you be concerned with regards to that and the currency impact on HDFS. The answer is no. HDFS is predominantly in the United States and Canada. They do help with arrangements around the world, but the vast majority of revenue is here in North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking a quick follow-up here. So, loved the commentary on the regional disparities in demand. But almost seemed to suggest with Northeast way down, West Coast way up that there's an opportunity here in the second quarter and beyond that things could get a little bit better. I guess are you thinking about things that way? It wouldn't seem as such given the reduced guidance or do you think that some of these other offsets are only going to get worse, like do you think that from a competitive perspective the second quarter is actually going to be a little bit worse than the first quarter? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, James. We are very confident in our shipment guidance of 276,000 motorcycles to 281,000 motorcycles. We've talked about weather before. If it happens early in the season, we believe it's more timing. And if spring doesn't happen or gets pushed out, we do believe there's a larger impact on a year-over-year basis. And at this point on the weather, we would believe more timing.","The 6,000 units that we took out are driven by the competitive discounting that we're seeing in the United States. Internationally we feel very good about our business there. And in United States, we're under pressure from the price discounting and we're dealing with that by taking 6,000 units out and tightening up our inventories here a little bit. But we feel very good about our 2% to 4% shipment growth as we move forward.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Do you feel you were negatively impacted in the quarter by not having any new mid-year models like you did last year and also did you ship any Streets to Riding Academy this quarter?","John A. Olin - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","To start with the second question first is, no. Predominantly, the dealer fill for Rider Academy happened in the first and the second quarter of last year. It was about 2,200 units. There could be a couple replacement units going into the market now, but it was largely a one-time dealer fill and that was about 600 units in the first quarter and 1,600 units in the second quarter.","The second is, in terms of model year launches, from time to time we've come out with a mid-model year; I think the last couple years we have. And it's all part of the broader plan on product development. We've got that sketched out for the next five years, so we do not intend to have a product in this quarter. And we do not believe it had a dramatic impact on our volumes in the first quarter.","Amy Giuffre - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, John, and thank you, everyone, for your time this morning.

Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","Joining me this morning, are President and CEO Matt Levatich and CFO John Olin. Matt let\u2019s get started.","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Amy and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were in line with our plans, and we delivered the numerous highlights noted in our release including another quarter of improved international retail sales growth and increased year-over-year earnings per share. We are managing our business with resilience in a challenging time in our history; taking stock of our strengths and better leveraging them for a more promising road ahead. Throughout this year, we have been focused on the following: driving demand for a richer mix of products amidst tough U.S. industry conditions yielding year-to-date revenue growth in the face of declining new unit sales; managing our cost structure and shifting how we think and how we work to liberate investment, and focus on the enterprise on value creation; adapting to trade policy burdens on our business, and laying the ground work to revitalize motorcycling in the U.S. and around the globe for generations to come.","The unveiling of our More Roads to Harley-Davidson accelerated plan for growth has been very well-received and will be the focus of my remarks this morning. The plan is designed to accelerate our strategy to build the next generation of riders globally by delivering new products, creating broader access, and strengthening our dealers. We intend to drive revenue growth and expand operating margins, and we have challenged ourselves to fund this strategic shift while keeping our current investment & return profile and capital allocation strategy intact through 2022.","In our discussions with stakeholders, we are often asked: When will the U.S. industry return to growth? And Why the More Roads plan now? The answer to both questions lies in the fundamentals of our industry and the opportunities to leverage the company\u2019s strengths more aggressively. It is clear there is a fundamental issue with the U.S. industry, and increased ridership is key to returning to growth. Our headline goal to build the next generation of riders is being amplified with our More Roads plan. It addresses the industry challenges today and into the future, while unlocking significant international opportunity for the business and brand. It is a plan for growth and value creation, and it was born from a top to bottom assessment of our business. We have a realistic view of challenges we face and how to unlock opportunities where future growth lies.","We have been putting the rider first in all our thinking and all that we do. We see the global consumer needs and interests shifting. We know we must lead the industry with bold actions to change our trajectory and boost the global industry at large. We will better leverage our vast capabilities and competitive firepower, strengths in product development, manufacturing, our brand and our great dealer network. We\u2019re building new capabilities such as a delivering a multi-channel retail experience, leading in electric mobility and engaging urban dwellers and youth more meaningfully.","Through More Roads, we plan to strengthen our existing business and enable sustainable growth with the next generation of riders through 2022. It will take time -- it is not a quick-fix. While we have made a promising start, there is much to do; our resolve is ever-increasing. We have established financial and non-financial milestones to hold ourselves accountable to the work we must do to execute our plan, and we will report on our progress along the way.","Our stakeholders have also asked us, are you abandoning who you are and your traditional customers? The answer is absolutely not. Our plan is Harley-Davidson through and through, and we maintain our commitment to delivering the products and experiences our customers expect from us. This plan is everything we have ever been, plus more. It\u2019s true that this plan will redefine the existing boundaries of our brand and we\u2019ll reach more customers through new types of products and channels. We\u2019ll secure the legacy of Harley-Davidson freedom for generations to come by executing our plan in a way that honors and rewards our extraordinarily loyal and passionate customer base and reinforces all we stand for as a brand and as a company.","Our plan is both ambitious and achievable. We aim to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders by leveraging three growth catalysts: new products, broader access and stronger dealers. At the time we announced the More Roads plan, some initiatives were already underway, and we have made strong progress through September. I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes reviewing some highlights.","First, New Products. In early 2017 we shared our objectives including a goal to launch 100 new, high-impact products by 2027. Since 2012, we have more than doubled our product development investment and have built significant product innovation and speed-to-market capabilities. In our More Roads plan, we are very transparent about the segments we will compete in, including products that keep current riders engaged by extending our leadership in Cruiser and Grand American Touring. We will introduce products that unlock new market segments and inspire a new generation of riders to join motorcycling. We will also competitively participate in large and growing global segments like Streetfighter and Adventure Touring, plus we will define a new category with a full portfolio of EV products from LiveWire to an array of lightweight urban bikes.","In the market spaces in which we lead, our 2019 models up\u2019d the ante. For 2019 the Milwaukee-Eight 107 has been further leveraged and is now available on additional models as a 114 and 117. And we once again raised the bar in infotainment and trike innovation.","In August we started conducting EV Readiness seminars with our dealers. Already, hundreds of U.S. dealers have raised their hands to be among the first EV-ready dealers. We are energized by the great enthusiasm among our dealers who also want Harley-Davidson to define and lead two-wheeled electrification.","We recently announced plans to establish a satellite product development center to support our future product portfolio. We\u2019re calling it H-D LiveWire Labs. It\u2019s located in Silicon Valley - the hub for high-tech innovation and scientific development, especially around technology critical to EV leadership. We\u2019ve already hired some extremely talented people who will augment the tremendous team at the Willie G. Davidson product development center in Milwaukee.","Second, we said we would broaden access to our brand and products and reach more customers. Our research shows that our brand appeal is universal, but access is narrowly focused. So, we are committed to building an integrated, multi-channel customer experience for the Harley-Davidson customers of today and tomorrow. We\u2019ll meet consumers where they are and how they want to engage, whether online or in-store. And we\u2019ve already taken a nice step forward -- our brand and select products are now accessible through a Harley-Davidson branded Amazon storefront. Amazon offers unrivaled access to hundreds of millions of potential new customers. And just as we are doing with our motorcycle product objectives, this new channel plays a role in us reaching the next generation, and building stronger customer relationships through a premium, multi-channel experience. And third, we said we, and our dealers would grow stronger by driving a performance framework to improve dealer financial strength and the Harley-Davidson customer experience.","Our dealer network is a clear advantage today and will continue to be the hub of our customer experience going forward. Dealers need the capabilities, drive and support to meet new customer demands and rapidly evolving retail expectations. Our enhanced approach to dealer network management allows the best-performing and most entrepreneurial retail partners to drive network innovation and success for themselves and Harley-Davidson with exceptional customer experience at the core. We have made initial progress on this front as well, by implementing new support and incentive programs and frameworks for dealers to bring clarity and urgency to the effort. Replacing underperforming dealers and upskilling the network is key, as is continuing to add more international dealers.","In all of this, it\u2019s easy for product to take the spotlight. We have many exciting products in-store but I will continue to emphasize the strong linkage between the three growth catalysts. New products will require broader access and stronger dealers to realize the full potential for the business. For example, stronger dealers will be necessary when we drive new types of customers into the dealerships through new products and broader access initiatives. We cannot achieve a single one without the others, lockstep progress in all of these areas matters both in the near-term and in the achievement of our objectives over time.","It is clear this is a time when bold actions are needed to assure our future. We are operating from a position of strength and the team is fired up by this work and our plans. We are shifting our focus to accelerate our plan for growth and we are showing up differently as a company. It\u2019s reflected in our products and the steps we have taken to build on our strengths while we grow new capabilities. This plan is not a short-term fix for what is a fundamental issue in the U.S. industry. It is a way to optimize in the near-term and create domestic and international opportunities to provide sustainable growth over time.","In summary, we are demonstrating our resilience in real time in a dynamic world and driving value in every decision we make - intensifying our focus on improving the strength and prospects of our business for the long-term through accelerating our strategic actions. I am proud of our team, employees, dealers and suppliers and I want to thank our loyal and passionate riders who we all work tirelessly to serve. Thank you to our investors, as well. ","Now John will review the financial results for the third quarter. John?","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our plans. In the face of ongoing retail sales headwinds in the U.S., we remained focused on reducing U.S. retail inventory, reducing costs and investing in our strategy to drive value for our riders, dealers and shareholders. ","The summary of our Q3 results is on slide 11. In the third quarter, revenue was up behind increased shipments. Compared to last year, we shipped more bikes during the quarter as we continued to balance the timing of shipments throughout the year which resulted in lower overall retail inventory and a significantly improved level of current model year motorcycles.","Motorcycle operating income was up as a result of higher shipments and favorable mix, partially offset by a $14.8 million restructuring charge, increased SG&A and the impact of higher year-over-year tariffs. Financial Services operating income was up 8.7%. Consolidated net income was up 66.9% due to higher operating income and the benefit of a considerably lower tax rate. EPS for the quarter was $0.68, which was up 70.0% versus the prior year. When excluding manufacturing optimization costs, EPS was $0.78. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term, despite near-term headwinds.","On Slide 12, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q3 were down 7.8 percent versus prior year. International retail sales were up behind strong sales in Europe and our emerging markets. In the U.S., Q3 retail sales were down versus prior year driven by steep industry declines in the U.S. and lower market share.","Through nine months, worldwide retail sales were down 5.9% driven by the U.S. industry decline of 8.7%. Despite the very weak U.S. industry performance, we continue to expect to meet our full-year shipment guidance; however, we now believe we will likely finish toward the low end of our guidance range. ","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the U.S. on Slide 13. U.S. retail sales were down 13.3% in the third quarter against strong headwinds from the weak U.S. industry which was down 9.8%. We believe the industry sales of new motorcycles continued to be adversely impacted by soft used bike prices, partially offset by less severe hurricane impacts compared to Q3 2017. We believe hurricane Florence had a nominal impact on our Q3 retail sales.","Looking at used bikes -- prices remain at historically low levels compared to new, however, we are encouraged as we continue to see positive momentum in used bike pricing. During Q3, used Harley-Davidson prices at auction were up versus prior year. We continued to see pricing services such as NADA and Black Book publish higher values for Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the third quarter. Additionally, for the fifth consecutive quarter, we saw rising prices of used Harley-Davidson bikes in our dealer network.","Used Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales were up through August. And, our share of combined new and used motorcycle registrations was up through August 2018 after having been up for the last 9 consecutive full years. We believe used sales are a strong indicator of our healthy brand fundamentals and provide prospects for future new bikes sales.","Our share of new bike registrations in Q3 was 50.9%, down 2.2 percentage points. Our U.S. market share reflects the adverse impact of relatively strong growth in segments in which we do not currently compete.","In the segments which we compete -- the Touring and Cruiser segments -- which represent approximately 70% of the 601+cc market -- our market share was up slightly during the quarter and was up 1.0 percentage points on a year-to-date basis.","We continued to carefully manage the flow of new bikes into the channel which resulted in Q3 quarter-end retail inventory in the U.S. decreasing approximately 2,200 motorcycles over the prior year. Combined with last year\u2019s Q3 reduction of 12,200 motorcycles, retail inventory at the end of Q3 has been reduced over 14,400 units over the last two years.","The performance of the overall 601+cc industry continued to be disappointing. We expect the U.S. industry to remain challenged into 2019 and we will continue to proactively address the weak U.S. industry:","In the near-term, we are introducing exciting new products and adding innovation that customers value on our new motorcycles. We also continue to aggressively manage supply and execute marketing efforts to encourage trial and increase conversion to sale.","In the mid-to-long term, we are accelerating our strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders. Through 2022, our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan is aimed at stabilizing our core business as we grow more riders globally. We are building the proper foundation and driving the right fundamentals to help steer the industry back to growth.","On Slide 14, International retail sales were up 2.6% in the third quarter. We were pleased to see the growth trajectory in our international markets strengthen for the third consecutive quarter. Emerging markets retail sales were up 17.5% during the quarter versus prior year. We experienced double-digit growth in several markets including China, Brazil and Mexico.","Retail sales in developed markets were down 2.5% during the quarter. Retail sales grew 3.0% in Western Europe driven by strong sales of our new Softail motorcycles. Retail sales in Japan and Australia continued to be weak in Q3 behind contracting industry sales and competitive new product introductions in segments outside of Touring and Cruiser. We continue to drive demand in these markets through marketing programs with a significant focus on national test ride campaigns.","Our market share through September in Europe was 10.4%, up 0.8 percentage points versus the prior year. Finally, we continued to expand our international dealer network and added nine new dealers during the quarter.","As our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan reinforces, we remain confident in and committed to the great potential that international markets offer to Harley-Davidson. This plan supports the strength of our brand, products and distribution to drive sustainable growth in international markets.","On Slide 15, wholesale motorcycle shipments were up in the quarter, and were near the mid-point of our shipment guidance range. Mix in Q3 reflects a more normal shipment mix of our Touring bikes compared to a very low shipment mix in the prior year period.","On Slide 16, revenue for the Motorcycles segment was up 16.8% in the third quarter behind a 16.7% increase in year-over-year motorcycle shipments. Revenue during the quarter benefited from a $1,535 increase in the average motorcycle revenue per bike. This increase was driven by a richer product mix and higher year-over-year pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing of our new model year 2019 motorcycles increased approximately 2.5%. Adjusting for the cost of the new content, pricing net of costs increased approximately 1.5 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue.","G&A revenue decline was in line with new motorcycle retail sales decline during the quarter. General Merchandise revenue was down as it lapped last year\u2019s strong sell-in of our 115th anniversary product. We were pleased to see a very profitable mix of products again in the third quarter. We are working to grow our business and remain focused on our approach to optimize profitability and maximize brand value.","On Slide 17, gross margin in Q3 was up as a result of higher shipments, strong mix and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency and higher raw materials costs. Q3 mix favorability was driven by higher shipment mix of our Touring motorcycles. In the fourth quarter, we expect mix to be largely flat as we lap a higher than normal mix of Touring shipments in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The financial impact of currency was unfavorable by $7.4 million during the third quarter. A stronger U.S. dollar adversely impacted revenue by 1.3%. This adverse impact was partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains. Raw material costs were higher during the quarter behind increased steel and aluminum prices.","Finally, manufacturing was slightly favorable versus prior year driven by increased absorption on higher production and shipments, offset by higher year-over-year tariffs and temporary inefficiencies related to our Manufacturing Optimization. Tariff costs increased by $9.9 million driven by higher EU tariffs. ","During the quarter, approximately 60% of our shipments to EU dealers included tariffs at the increased rate. Our expectations for the impact of recently enacted tariffs includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum and approximately $25 million for EU tariffs. ","Additionally, China increased its tariffs on imported motorcycles produced in United States by 25 percentage points, and the U.S. has increased tariffs for certain products imported from China. We believe this will increase our 2018 costs by approximately $3 million. In total, we now expect to incur approximately $43 million to $48 million of increased costs related to tariffs during 2018.","On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q3 was 5.8%, up 4.0 percentage points compared to last year. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A spending and a $14.8 million restructuring charge related to our manufacturing optimization. Profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus. It is our objective to further leverage our established capabilities to continue to drive profit, cash flow and top-quartile ROIC into the future.","HDFS\u2019 Q3 operating income, shown on Slide 19, increased 8.7% compared to last year behind a favorable provision for loan losses and higher net interest income, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was favorable by $7.3 million driven by lower credit losses and a reduction in the reserve rate compared to a rising reserve rate in Q3 2017. Net interest income was up $3.7 million due to higher receivables and lower year-over-year borrowing costs. HDFS\u2019 cost of funds was lower in the third quarter despite rising market interest rates as $877 million of 6.8% MTNs matured in the second quarter.","HDFS\u2019 operational results are on Slide 20. Q3 originations were up 9.3% versus prior year despite lower new retail sales in the U.S. Originations were up primarily on increased used motorcycle sales in the dealer network. Market share was 67.9%, up a very strong 9.3 percentage points during the quarter driven by low rate finance offers. At the end of the quarter, there was $350.3 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $806.1 million of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities.","On Slide 21, the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet at the end of September was 3.60% or 12 basis points lower than Q3 2017. The annualized retail credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.55%, or 18 basis points lower than 2017. HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company.","The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 22. Year-to-date operating cash flow was up $173.5 million, or 18.3% from last year driven by lower working capital as we remain very focused and diligent on our use of operating cash. Our effective tax rate was 23.1% year-to-date, which was considerably lower than last year largely due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, the third quarter benefitted from a release of tax reserves and a true-up of deferred tax assets related to the 2017 tax act. And finally, regarding liquidity, the company has, and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","We believe the charts on Slide 23 demonstrate that we benchmark very well against various peer groups in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders for the period of 2015 to 2017. One of the five objectives guiding our business strategies and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by Motor Company ROIC in the top quartile of the S&P 500, and by a best-in class return on equity at HDFS. Harley-Davidson is a leader in ROIC at the Motor Company and ROE at HDFS and is the clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders.","Slide 24 illustrates our recent history of returning cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter of 2018, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and repurchased $84.5 million of our stock. Driving superior value for all our stakeholders is our top priority. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and share repurchases.","On Slide 25, is the summary of our multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative. During the third quarter, we incurred $14.8 million of restructuring expense driven primarily by accelerated depreciation. We also incurred $6.2 million in related temporary inefficiencies. Through the third quarter, we are tracking favorably to our planned costs, and as a result, we are reducing the expected total cost by $15 million. We now expect total program costs to be between $155 to $185 million. The expected 2018 and 2019 allocation is noted on the slide. We continue to expect to invest approximately $75 million of capital and expect annual ongoing cash savings of between $65 and $75 million after 2020.","We believe these investments have very attractive returns. When completed, we expect this initiative will simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus in our operational investments, and improve gross margin by approximately 1.5 percentage points.","Moving on to guidance on Slide 26. We are confirming our expectations for 2018 except for financial services operating income, capital spending and the effective tax rate. Motorcycle shipments in the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 45,800 to 50,800, down approximately 3% to up approximately 8% compared to prior year. Note that, in line with our plans, shipments in the first half of this year were down 10.5% versus 2017 \u2013 significantly constraining U.S. dealer retail inventory. Q3 shipments were up double digits as we lapped last year\u2019s significant Q3 shipment and inventory reduction compared to Q3 2016. Through the first nine months of 2018, shipments were down 4.7% and tracked to our full-year expectation of shipments being down approximately 2% to 4%. Our 2018 shipment cadence has resulted in lower dealer inventory throughout the selling season and significantly improved mix of new versus carry-over motorcycle inventory. ","We continue to expect U.S. dealer retail inventory to be flat at year-end compared to last year, and international dealer inventory is expected to increase behind a growing dealer network and increasing sales momentum. ","Our guidance adjustments are as follows. We now expect HDFS operating income to be up compared to 2017. We are reducing our full year capital spending estimated range by $20 million as a result of a strong focus on cash flow and asset efficiency. We now expect 2018 capital spending to be approximately $230 million to $250 million. And, we now expect our full year effective tax rate will be between 22.5% and 24% ","Just yesterday, we notified our dealers of a voluntary safety recall that we authorized for a hydraulic clutch assembly on all model year 2017 and 2018 Touring, Trike and CVO Touring models and also on certain 2017 Softail models. This voluntary recall includes approximately 238,300 motorcycles and we estimate the cost to be approximately $35 million. The charge will occur in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be between 9% and 10%; however, given the expected net cost of this recall, we believe our full-year operating margin will likely finish at the low end of the range. Recalls are frustrating for us, and for all of our stakeholders, however the safety of our riders is our highest priority. We, along with our dealers are committed to addressing this issue and continuing to provide customers with the quality experience and service they expect.","To wrap up we\u2019ll continue to drive premium value for our riders, dealers and our brand relentlessly focused on our long term objective, to be disciplined in our management of motorcycle supply and amplify our cost management efforts. We will continue to focus our investments, deliver strong returns to our shareholders and drive growth for the company for the long-term. Thank you. Now let\u2019s take your questions.","Amy Giuffre","This is Amy before we take questions I understand there has been audio technical difficulty during the call. We will post a PDF of these prepared remarks on our website following this call, so you can have all of the clear words. Also during Q&A analysts if you can\u2019t hear us if the audio cuts out we\u2019ll leave the mike open so you can ask for clarification. Apologize for the difficulty and let\u2019s continue with questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","I am sure there\u2019ll be questions on retail and tariffs, but I wanted to ask about cash flow and the buyback. John, I think you spent $85 million in Q3 to buy back stock and have spent just under $200 million to repurchase back year-to-date. I think at this time last year, you would've spent over 450 million. So I am just wondering what prevents Harley from really backing up the truck, the buy back at current levels?","John Olin","You\u2019re absolutely right. On a year-to-date basis, we bought back 188 million versus prior year of 456 million, two things driving that. Number one, is if you recall More Roads plan that we introduced in April, we shutdown the window for the Company to repurchase shares and that remained closed for four months. So over the assuming five months, we\u2019re catching up on that window shutdown. The second piece is when you look at last year's share repurchases of $456 million that was through three quarters. We did not buy any shares in the fourth quarter of last year. So we would expect this gap to close somewhat as we move forward through the fourth quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Actually, I guess one question and then just one quick clarification. So I am just curious how you reconcile the improving trends and used by prices with the retail performance in the U.S. And then when should we expect a firm announcement on the manufacturing plans related to tariff?","Matt Levatich","With regards to improving trends, we have seen on the trends improve at retail on our dealer network to used by prices for the last quarter -- last five quarters. And prior to that, they had the declined for the previous 13 quarter. And Sharon, at this point, while they are improving, they still got a fair way to go to make up for what they had fallen in the previous 13 quarters. So when you look at the overall price gaps while improving, they are still at historical high levels. And a lot of customers are moving and buying used bikes in lieu of new at times.","And we're certainly thrilled with the fact that we continue to gain market share and total demand of new and used. But we are very focused on doing everything we can to help close that price gap between new and used, largely through aggressive management of our supply of new motorcycles.","The second question was with regards to more information on the tariffs and the mitigating opportunities that we have as we move forward. Right now, Sharon, we are looking at all the things that we need to do to move the production of our EU volumes to plants outside the United States. We initially said it was going to take 12 to 18 months. This is something that we never contemplated on doing. We never imagined moving production for our European customer out of the United States, and here we are. So we're going through understanding all the cost profile, the logistics, how to move the supply chain. And when we have that information in that plan, we will share that it our stakeholders likely in the first part of next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Tim Conder","I wanted to clarify also on the on the tariffs, John. So you said $43 million to $48 million here in 2018, granted list 3 just came on. Can you just if we annualize that then and then looking into '19, should we at least double this amount for full year '19 run rate or could be a little bit higher than that given that the China partner's on? And then the other question would be related to LiveWire profitability. You all said that would be profitable when launched. How long do you think to take that to get up to company -- close to company margins, granted that it probably won\u2019t be there or from an ROIC return perspective on LiveWire?","John Olin","The first question with regards to tariffs, yes, we expect $43 million to $48 million this year. And that\u2019s made up of the three component pieces that I mentioned, which are metals costs, EU tariffs and now China tariffs. As we looked at an annualized view of that, we expect in EU those tariffs on an annualized view unmitigated to be $90 million to $100 million. With the new China tariffs, we look for those to be on the $10 million to $12 million range on an annualized basis. Both of which we will look to mitigate those as we figure out the production.","Matt Levatich","With regards to LiveWire profitability, we absolutely expect that we will be profitable as we come out LiveWire. And it is not going to be at the full company margin, but they will be at margins that exceed a fair amount of our overall product line up. So we\u2019re very happy with where we\u2019re at in terms of the margin. And as electric continues to grow as a part of our overall portfolio, we feel that it will not bring down overall margins at any great extent.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman","I guess a clarification and a question. If memory serves, there might be some timing differences that prevent us from doing the math on inventory numbers. But I struggle little bit to get your 2,200 bike reduction, I get about 135 bike shipped and 135 bikes registered over the past four quarters. So maybe a clarification on that. And then I guess as we sit here, year-to-date U.S. retail down 10% and yet we\u2019re talking about flattish inventories. I would think that on turns basis to keep things healthy, we would need to see a significant reduction in shipments this year. Why is flat inventory the right course of action just given how bad retail has been so far this year? Thanks.","Matt Levatich","With regards to the year-over-year inventory, all is I can tell you it is down 2,200 units on a year-over-year basis. As we talked in the past, we got to be little bit careful in the period of time that retail sales ended on a calendar basis versus reported on a calendar basis and on fiscal basis for shipments. So there\u2019s typically a little bit of an adjustment there. But you can call back and we can talk you through it but inventory is down 2,200 units and that\u2019s on top of significant reduction the previous year.","Secondly is with regards to the U.S. being down, we\u2019re down on a year-to-date basis 10.2 percentage mentioned and we\u2019re looking for inventories to be flat. The main reason for that is that we\u2019ve got a selling season to get over and the spring season to get over. And from a production standpoint, we happen to have enough inventory to make it through that high part of the selling season. So our strategy has been is to limit the amount of inventory in the system throughout the selling season. And we have been down quite considerably throughout the first nine months and continue to be down during the fourth quarter.","As we exit the year, we would expect inventories to be flat. And as the selling season starts, we will continue to constrain inventories and I am judicious that we'll manage that supply. But it's more a function of our ability to produce the inventories that we need for selling season, James.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gerrick Johnson","I'll stick with one clarification and one question. So on Tim\u2019s question about tariffs, you talked about Europe and China. But what about the annualized impact of the 232 steel aluminum. That\u2019s the clarification. And my question is, you mentioned the aging urban dwellers. So I was curious about your dealer base and if you have the dealer base footprint in urban markets to accomplish that, and what does your dealer footprint in urban markets look like compared to the competition? Thank you.","John Olin","Gerrick, I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. With regards to the metals and aluminum, we expect the impact of that to be $15 million to $20 million, we still expect that. When we look forward, we're going to stop talking about metals and aluminum. The market -- those costs are baked in unless something dramatically changes, aluminum and steel prices are just going to be higher. So we\u2019re not looking at another year of increases in that. And again, it's now up to the market as to what it does. But we will continue to report out on as the actual tariffs from the countries that we have in this point in the EU and China.","Matt Levatich","Gerrick, it's Matt, on your question about urban dwellers. The answer actually rest in the comment I made in my opening remarks about how the three catalysts of More Roads; so, new products, broader access, stronger dealers, are all interrelated. And we will be bringing forward products that will appeal more significantly to young adults, will appeal and more meaningful to young adults in urban areas. And with that, we will need to amplify and accentuate the broader access components to make them aware, as well as the dealer component so that they have access through retail channel.","So part of the reason why more roads was necessary to be so transparent for coming about what plans are is because we're shifting the nature and profile of the Company for all the reasons that we mentioned, the need to arrest the trends in the U.S. market and build the next generation of riders and people need to prepare. The dealers need to prepare, we need to prepare, we need to raise our game on how we show up differently as a brand in these urban markets, for example, with different kinds of products, with different kinds of marketing and different forms of distribution. So we'll be working with our dealer network, doing pilots on urban formats over the coming years to validate the business model and the approach that will work for those target customers. So thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joe Altobello","I guess, first for you, John, just to make sure I heard this correct because the audio wasn\u2019t great. I think you said sales of new and used Harley's were up through August. Is that for July and August or year-to-date or both?","John Olin","Joe, that\u2019s through year-to-date August that information comes on a lag basis that is all registrations in the United States. And when we look at the combined new and used, which we refer to as total demand overall market share was up through year-to-date August.","Joe Altobello","And then if there is a tariff impact, I guess you laid out you do the math, you got $115 million to $132 million of impact next year. I assume that\u2019s a gross number. How much do you think you can offset that through pricing under counter measures?","John Olin","Well, that\u2019s what we're working on, Joe, is we expect to offset the vast majority of it. And right now we're putting the plans together to do that.","Joe Altobello","Well, you look pretty confident?","John Olin","Yes, and we will provide more information on the timing and how we will do that as soon as we have those plans developed.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Matt, I have one question but it has a few parts. So at the beginning of your prepared remarks, you said the quarter results were on plan and I completely know what you meant, you explained that well. But just in the near-term, the U.S. retail registrations, the clients did accelerate in the quarter, which I\u2019m sure wasn\u2019t on your plan. So you've addressed the bigger picture problem that you\u2019re improving that. But can your More Roads program stem the declines in the very linear term? Or maybe asked another way, according to your roadmap, when do you expect to see a sustainable improvement in the U.S. retail registrations? And then also, should we interpret John\u2019s comments that the U.S. will remain challenged in 2019? Is that you\u2019re going to continue to expect U.S. shipments to decline next year?","Matt Levatich","Felicia, there\u2019s a lot in there, some of it I addressed, maybe some not as clearly. The U.S. industry, the challenge is a fundamental one with the level of rider ship and it's not an easily fixed short-term issue. We believe that More Roads is absolutely targeting the right things to do for the industry long-term. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re leading in that effort. And more and more of the industry is joining in that effort, because the U.S. is a great motorcycle market for all the players. So there's a lot of work going on within the Company on a couple levels; one is the data we need to drive the focus in our action.","We've talked a lot about the data and the analysis around the rider ship, migration database, how we better leverage that. We spent 2018 doing a lot of experimentation, very targeted focus, maybe on a regional basis or half a dozen or a dozen dealers, doing trials to determine, for example, how we better improve the conversion rate of riding academy graduates, actually create riders, not just trained riders. So there\u2019s a lot of really good core work going with the company that is both in line with what we\u2019re trying to long-term, but also addressing the near-term headwind that we face, because absolutely this is a significant issue for the business and we have a tough couple of years to get through until some of these products and distribution and so forth start to be tailwinds for the Company.","So there's a lot going on. I think it\u2019s difficult to cover everything within this meeting. But when I mentioned that we\u2019re showing up differently as a company, it\u2019s for things like that about how we look at the industry and we how drive the industry, not just for the long term but for the immediate term. And John, I don\u2019t know if you want to share anything or\u2026","John Olin","So, Felicia, you had asked about my comment about being challenged into 2019. The price tags are still there. They\u2019re closing. But they\u2019re not closing fast enough. So we do expect continuing challenge in the U.S. industry next year. We will not provide guidance on that until we get into January. But I will tell you that we are doing everything that we can to make up for this trough in the U.S. industry. And I tell you what, the resilience of Harley-Davidson, both brand and company, is just extraordinary.","And we've talked about the brand and the fact that for 10 straight years, we\u2019ve gained market share in terms of total demand for our product. We haven\u2019t talked about as much about the resiliency of us as a company. And when you look at the year that we\u2019re having this year, one of the most challenging years that we've had in 40 years, we've got shipments down on a year-to-date basis by 4.7%. However, revenue was up by 3.7%, a pretty solid delivery of revenue and extraordinary -- and a year-over-year main driver of revenue was down 4.7%.","And as we continue to follow through that and if you look at operating income through nine months and you take out the one-time items that we\u2019re spending in terms of our manufacturing optimization and the tariffs that we look to mitigate, operating income is up. When you look at HDFS, the core driver of HDFS growth is retail sales in the United States, with that being down 10.2%, yet HDFS\u2019s revenue was up 1.4%. And when you pull it all together, earnings per share, up 7.5% despite the $100 million or $93 million of onetime items; cash flow of $173.5 million up an 18.3%.","The unbelievable resilience of Harley-Davidson, it just never stops, ceases to surprise me. And we\u2019re going to continue to do what we need to do over the near-term until More Roads does take hold and we get into that more rapid growth that we're expecting, which is $1 billion to $1.5 billion of revenue growth over the next five years. But in the meantime, we will be very diligent in how we manage this very resilient company.","Matt Levatich","John thanks. I\u2019m going to just tag on to that a little bit, because we're out talking to stakeholders, including investors, your-selves, our dealers and so forth. And we hear seems often with a skeptical tone and to be honest, we apply that tone to ourselves in how we think about the work we need to do. No one in this Company is satisfied with the trends as they are today and we're digging hard every day. But it seems like we\u2019re not attracting new and younger riders, we don't have the right products, so we\u2019re losing market share to the competition. So, I just want to take a second to provide a little color, because the data that just doesn\u2019t really support those simplistic conclusions.","So for example, we see tremendous interest among young people. Our marketing efforts, combined recent product launches, particularly to refresh Softails, are drawing in younger writers, both new to the sport and new to brand. Our marketing efforts have increased relevance and engagement with young adults. Over half are social media followers are 18 to 34, and that mix is growing. Just a little bit of color on that to find your freedom intern program.","We finished this summer with our eight interns garnering over 200 million media impressions and more than 43 million social video views, bringing Harley-Davidson to new generation from a generation on their turf and on their terms. And think even more important than that was the value those interns brought to us in us seeing through their eyes how our products and our brand and experiences mean -- what they mean and how they matter to that generation. So we were able to really see through their eyes how to focus our efforts.","Mark, when it comes to products, current and future offerings include a much wider variety of style, function, power price. Therefore, riders across demographics and generations, our pricing stars $6,899 today and we offer seven Sportster models under 12 brands. And in our brand new Softail platform, nine of the 13 models are selling to riders who are younger than previous Softail and Dyna buyers, which is a fantastic piece of data that says some of the things we're doing here are moving the needle.","We've been very transparent, as I mentioned earlier; about future products, products than span an even wider spectrum of power, style, you name it; in segments that were not in today, like adventure touring and Streetfighter; and with EV products to take Harley-Davidson even further; all of which have a stronger appeal with younger riders to earlier comments urban dwellers, et cetera. And John mentioned these points since we\u2019re saying it again. When we look at market share, we know the biggest challenge is not our relative competitiveness, but the ongoing overall decline in the U.S industry.","It's something the whole industry faces. In the third quarters, our share of combined new and used was up year-to-date, which speaks to the power we bring our share of new bike registrations was very strong 50.9. And yes, we lost a couple of points of market share but it's largely due to a gradual shift toward heavy weight segments we\u2019re not in, about 30% of the heavy weight market. Where we do compete, as John said, touring and cruiser, our share was actually up in the third quarter. And again, the products that we have in the hopper will absolutely appeal to those customers outside our traditional spaces. So we\u2019re dialed in.","We\u2019re executing the initiatives under the long-term strategy. And we\u2019re already making headway. We\u2019ve laid this out as a 10-year plan, because resurrection of an industry will not happen overnight and it will require others to join the effort. We carry with pride our leadership position in this quest and we\u2019re digging into drive it. The More Roads plan will take courage, it will take capability, it will take conviction from employees, from dealers and suppliers. And I can say with confidence that everybody associated with this company and brand is fired up about our plans to move the needle on the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","David Beckel","On a brighter note, I suppose I wanted to ask a little about the LiveWire bike. And specifically, if you could shed any light or detail on what you\u2019re hearing from dealers as they interact with customers about the new product. And from some of our surveys, they seem to suggest that there were orders being taken. Is that correct or is that -- is it too premature for that?","Matt Levatich","This is Matt, I\u2019ll just comment. First of all, if you look at the images of LiveWire by itself that one we're coming to market with, it looks -- it\u2019s a nicely updated version of the look and feel of project LiveWire. In fact, it\u2019s a way better motorcycle from a power delivery, ride and handling range, which was very important feedback that we got when we took project LiveWire out. We did over 12,000 demo rides around the world and we got really meaningful customer input that allowed us to dial in the product. So, we feel very good about the product. I had the opportunity to ride it during the 115th parade in Milwaukee. The only problem I had was that I had to ride in a parade and I couldn\u2019t open it up like I was inclined to do. It\u2019s a fantastic motorcycle. It is unlike any other powered vehicle I've ever experienced. And I think it is going to turn people's heads about what electric motorcycles can be and what our Harley-Davidson can be.","So, we\u2019re clearly excited about the product. The dealers as I mentioned are fired up the initial EV dealers that we\u2019ve lined up at the U.S. They are and some dealers who are not in the initial wave of EV dealers, are taking customer requests, down payments, et cetera, because people are fired up about the motorcycle. We are working on a facility to take preorders as we begin next year, so that we can use that as a way to focus the interest and attention, and also focus our awareness before launch on where the demand is. So we make sure we do the best job of getting the products to where the demand is once we launch, because these will be in relative constrained supply certainly in the early days of production. So we\u2019re excited about it.","We\u2019re excited a lot about what it says about what this company can do and what this brand can be. And it will be, if you will, the tip of the spear, the halo product in our EV investment that puts the flag in the ground that say, you need to come to Harley-Davidson to look for advanced technology like this.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","You guys offered 9% to 10% motorcycle operating margins I think that\u2019s with tariffs but without restructuring. And your competitor argued yesterday that they were being disproportionately impacted by tariffs given that there aren\u2019t that many manufacturers that are native to the United States, I guess. So, can you talk about any exemptions you guys might be seeking or attempting to participate and through lobbying to mitigate some of those tariff expenses? Thanks.","John Olin","So Jamie, you'd mentioned about the margin about 9% to 10%, a slight correction. That is inclusive of both our manufacturing optimization, which we expect to be -- there's $100 million range this year, as well as on the tariffs, which we talked about $43 million to $48 million. So that number is inclusive of both to those. With regards to the tariffs, we are doing everything we can in very avenue to make sure we minimize the impact of those tariffs to our customers, our profitability as we go forward. And that includes working with government and trade officials, as well as supply basis and again production where we produce.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joseph Spak","I guess, just wanted to touch base on the lower manufacturing optimization cost. You lowered it by almost 10%. Is that just as you went through the process, you realized some efficiency, or was it some potentially just conservative guidance to start, because you didn't -- took that first crack at? And should we have any read through that so there are potentially being any change to the $450 million to $500 million associated with the More Roads program?","John Olin","With regards to manufacturing optimization, this has nothing to do with the More Roads. More Roads, we\u2019re looking at an investment of $450 million to $550 million that will drive ultimate profitability and increase some profitability of $200 million to $250 million over the next five years, and that\u2019s all intact and going very well. With what I talked about is with regards to the manufacturing optimization, and this is where we're moving. We\u2019re reloading our K.C. facility into our York facility.","Things are moving on track as we had planned in terms of timing, and just favorable in terms of overall cost. And when you get into these, we estimate the best we can and we drive to that plan. And in this situation, our execution has been very good on time. We've moved all the Sportsters out of K. C. and now being produced in York, and we moved Street and Sportster out over the next six months. But overall, the costs are lower and we expect it to be $15 million lower, which we'd mentioned in the 8% range, and $20 million of that this year and then $5 million of it getting pushed out. But overall, this is going very well from a cost perspective and an execution perspective.","Joseph Spak","I guess what I was wondering is with the cost associated with More Roads, given that a lot of its further out. Do you think that was potentially conservative first crack like we saw with the manufacturing decision?","John Olin","No, Joe. We spent an incredible amount of time on the More Roads plan. We\u2019ve got it line itemed out in tremendous detail. And we are driving to that and we fully expect it to be $450 million to $550 million. And again hopefully noticed in the upfront part of the presentation all of the accomplishments that we have in a very short period of time. This organization couldn\u2019t be more dialed-in and focused on our future and More Roads. And we will spend the investment and we will garner the benefits of that as we move into the future.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, John. Thank you, Matt. And thanks to everyone for your time today. There\u2019s a number of questions remaining in the queue and I will follow-up with all of the analysts that we didn\u2019t get to.

At this time, I'd like to welcome you all to the third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Sarah, and welcome to Harley-Davidson's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. The audio for today's call is being webcast live on harley-davidson.com. The supporting slides can be accessed on the website by clicking Company, Investor Relations, then Events and Presentations.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","Today, you'll hear from Harley-Davidson CEO, Keith Wandell; and CFO, John Olin. President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund, is unable to join us for the call this morning, but will be joining us again next quarter. Following Keith and John's comments, we'll open the call for your questions. So let's get started. Keith?","Keith E. Wandell","Well, thank you, Amy. And good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. As we look back at the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, I'm truly proud of everything that the Harley-Davidson team of employees, dealers and suppliers has achieved so far in 2012.","During the quarter, we continued to see evidence of the successful execution of our strategy. With our focus on leadership in manufacturing and product development and at retail, we believe that we are increasingly poised to provide an even more exceptional customer experience. The entire team is focused and doing a great job of delivering on the many changes underway in all parts of the business. And together, we're positioning Harley-Davidson for success, not only today, but over the long term.","We achieved a pivotal milestone in the third quarter with the launch of the ERP operating system at our York plant. And we exited the quarter on track with our production targets. Now, our focus is on optimizing the system. And we're also making final preparations for the implementation of seasonal surge production capacity at York early next year. Implementation of the production changes at Milwaukee, Tomahawk and Kansas City, while not at the same magnitude as York, continue to go very well.","Coming out of 2012, we will be largely finished with our manufacturing restructuring, and we are delivering this massive change on time and on target. And that's great news, and it's a tremendous achievement that will benefit our customers, our dealers, our employees and our shareholders.","We're making steady progress in other areas as well.  We continue to grow outreach and core customer segments and expand our global reach. In the U.S., our strategy calls for us to grow sales to outreach customers at a faster rate than to core customers, and we're doing that. In all 3 quarters of this year, growth in sales to our U.S. outreach segments of young, adults, women, African Americans and Hispanics, has exceeded growth in sales to our U.S. core customers. In fact, through 9 months, sales to outreach customers grew at nearly twice the rate as sales to core riders, thus ensuring new riders coming into the Harley-Davidson family. As we noted previously, we continue to hold the #1 market share position in each of our U.S. outreach segments. And combined retail sales to outreach and core customers are up 6.2% through 9 months, compared to a year ago.","One of the key drivers with outreach and core customers alike is new products. And with our 2013 motorcycles, we believe we are again hitting the mark and expanding our leadership of the custom, cruiser and touring markets. The knockout 2013 Harleys include 5 new models introduced this year: the Softail Slim and the 72, which were launched in January; and the CVO Breakout and the CVO Road King; and the expansion of H-D1 factory customization to the Dyna Street Bob. There are also 5 models with big metal flake Hard Candy Custom paint and 10 limited edition, 110th Anniversary motorcycles. It all adds up to a lot of new offerings for both core and outreach customers. And in the years ahead, you can expect to increasingly see the results of our investments in bringing exceptional new products to market.","Let's turn to the international markets for a second. We continue to advance the opportunity we see for sales growth. We are on plan to open 100 to 150 new international dealerships between 2009 and 2014. And to date, in 2012, we've added 16 new international dealerships. And in total, since 2009, we've added 78 international dealerships. In Latin America, we've seen 16 consecutive months of double-digit growth, led by Brazil and Mexico. And in the Asia Pacific region, new motorcycle sales in Japan, Australia, China and India and our other emerging markets, are all up, in each of those markets, for the quarter and through 9 months. In the EMEA region, motorcycle sales grew 1.8% in the third quarter, despite the economic uncertainty in the EU. So a special thanks to our dealers and employees in the EMEA region for their accomplishments amid these challenging economic environments.","We also have seen strong sales in emerging markets worldwide, where Harley-Davidson retail motorcycles are up more than 30% this year. While today, these markets are a relatively small part of our overall volume, we believe our growth in emerging markets is a great example of Harley-Davidson's global appeal and the opportunity that lies ahead.","It's without question that we're making great progress, but we all know there's still a lot more to do. Harley-Davidson's strategy provides a roadmap for how we deliver exceptional product and brand experiences that foster deep, emotional connections with customers. Simply put, we must continue to be the best at what we do, not just today, but far into the future.","So thanks for your time today. Thanks for your investment, and thanks for your interest in Harley-Davidson. Now let me turn it over to John Olin.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results for the third quarter starting on Slide 11.","As we anticipated, our third quarter key financial metrics were down versus prior year. This is the result of significant changes to our historical shipping patterns, driven by the launch of a new ERP system at York during the quarter. I also want to recognize that it was a critical quarter, as we put in place some of the final pieces of our manufacturing strategy, which will enable us to better meet customer demand in the future.","With that as background, let's discuss our third quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was down 10.5%, behind a 14.5% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Our third quarter income from continuing operations was $134.0 million, a decrease of $49.6 million. Similarly, diluted earnings per share were $0.59 per share, down from $0.78 in the year-ago quarter, a 24.4% decrease. Operating income from the motorcycle business was $144.8 million, down 19.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The decrease was driven by a planned reduction in motorcycle shipments, partially offset by higher gross margin and favorable restructuring spending. Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up compared to last year's third quarter, driven by higher net interest income as we lapped a prior year loss on bond repurchases. Finally, this quarter's net income was adversely impacted by a higher tax rate as compared to last year's third quarter.","Now, let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 12. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new motorcycles were down 1.3% in the third quarter and up 6.0% year-to-date. Retail sales in the quarter reflect lower production that affected product availability in the U.S. Also impacting retail sales was the retiming of the new model year launch from July to August, as well as ongoing economic challenges in many worldwide markets.","Let's take a look at U.S., the U.S. market, on Slide 13. As we expected, retail sales in the U.S. in the third quarter were negatively impacted by limited product availability. During the quarter, U.S. retail sales were down 5.2%, but up 6.2% on a year-to-date basis. During the third quarter, U.S. retail inventory fell to extremely low levels, driven by 3 factors: First, planned production was down in July by about 40%, as we cut over to the new ERP system in York; second, the new model year introduction was moved out 1 month to August. Consequently, there was a longer period of time between ending model year 2012 production and shipping model year 2013 motorcycles. And third, August and early September York production was down from anticipated production rates, as our employees focused on system issues that came up during the ERP implementation.","As we discussed last quarter, we entered the third quarter with 6,800 more units in the U.S. retail inventory than the prior year. And at that time, we also expected inventory would quickly fall below prior year levels and would remain below prior year levels for most of the quarter. And remember, the prior year inventory level was already lower than desired. The quarter did play out largely as expected. Inventories quickly fell below prior year levels. However, as supply of York motorcycles was restored to prior year levels, sales responded positively. As we exited the quarter, dealer inventory ended up about 3,100 units higher than a year ago and retail momentum was strong. In terms of market share, our U.S. share was down slightly, reflecting limited product availability for most of the quarter. However, our U.S. market share softened by 0.2 percentage points to 57.7% in the third quarter versus prior year. Year-to-date, U.S. market share was up 1.4 percentage points to 56.5%, which is our highest September year-to-date market share on record.","On Slide 14, you'll see retail sales at international markets for the quarter grew 7.6%, driven by increased year-over-year sales in all major regions. During the third quarter, Latin America was up over 32%, driven by strong performance in Brazil and Mexico. Retail sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up 9.8%, driven by strong growth in our emerging markets and in Australia. We continue to be excited about our growing businesses in India and China. Additionally, we are pleased to see Japan was up 2.5% despite a challenging economic environment and increased competitive activity. The EMEA region was up 1.8% for the quarter compared to 2011. During the quarter, we continued to see significant softness in the U.K. and Southern European countries, especially Spain and Italy. While these markets remain down significantly, their rate of decline improved from the previous couple of quarters as they lapped the steep declines which began in Q3 2011. Northern Europe's retail sales continue to grow in the quarter behind strength in Germany and Switzerland. Through August, our market share in Europe was flat to prior year at 13.1%. We expect continued volatility and pressure on sales in the EMEA region as a result of the extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.","Finally, during the quarter, Canada was up 4.9% from the prior year period. International expansion is one of our core areas of investment for future growth. During the quarter, dealerships were opened in China, India, South Africa and Oman.","On Slide 15, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments during the quarter were down 14.5% compared to last year, behind lower production due to the implementation of the York ERP system. During the third quarter, Custom and Touring as a percent of total shipments, were 3.5 percentage points lower than prior year. This was also a result of the impact of the ERP implementation at York. International shipments as a percent of the total were up compared to last year as we allocated more motorcycles to international markets. As you may recall, in the second quarter, we temporarily diverted some international units to the U.S. to meet the strong demand in that market.","On Slide 16, you'll see revenue for Motorcycles and Related Products segment was down 11.6%, driven by lower shipments in motorcycles during the third quarter. Parts and Accessory revenue was down 0.8%, behind a 1.3% decrease in worldwide retail motorcycle sales. General Merchandise revenue was up 9.1%, driven by our sportswear and leathers categories, which included the new 110th Anniversary products. Average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $279 compared to last year, largely as a result of unfavorable currency translation in the quarter. On average, our major foreign currencies were weaker by approximately 9% between the third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2012.","During the quarter, we increased our global average prices for the 2013 model year motorcycles by approximately 0.75%. We believe our ability to increase prices for the second consecutive year reflects the strength of our brand and appeal of our new motorcycles.","Slide 17 provides the cadence and impact of our restructuring activities. The big news for the quarter was the York ERP implementation, a crucial milestone in our manufacturing transformation. While we are very pleased overall, we did experience some minor systems disruptions after we cut over in July. In fact, we lowered production in August and early September as we focused on resolving these system issues. While there were no major complications, the slower production compounded the already limited product availability during the quarter. By the end of the quarter, we were caught up on the lost production. However, we utilized overtime to catch up. Today, the York production line is largely running at speed, and we have shifted our focus to system optimization. We incurred approximately $11 million in temporary inefficiencies during the quarter. We were toward the high end of our range, partially due to the overtime we accumulated as we made up for the slower-than-planned production during the ERP implementation at York. As a result, we now expect $32 million to $35 million in temporary inefficiencies for the full year.","We are very pleased with the new system and look forward to the benefits it brings to our future. The next step at York is to prepare for the execution of our flexible manufacturing strategy, which will allow us to produce motorcycles closer to customer demand, starting in the first quarter of next year.","Turning to the restructuring cost and savings on Slide 18. We incurred $9.2 million in restructuring expenses during the quarter. We also moved $5 million of expected spending from 2013 -- 2012 to 2013. We now expect between $35 million to $45 million for the full year 2012, and $5 million to $10 million for 2013. We continue to expect total cost to be $490 million to $510 million. We also continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $315 million and $335 million upon completion of our restructuring activities. We are very pleased with our progress as we enter into the final stages of restructuring.","On Slide 19, you'll see gross margin in the quarter fell $37.5 million behind lower shipment volumes and unfavorable mix, which both were the result of the ERP implementation at York. Gross margin benefited from lower manufacturing cost as a result of restructuring savings. Gross margin also benefited from the model year 2013 motorcycle price increases and lower raw material costs. Foreign exchange positively impacted gross margin by $1.2 million. However, revenue was $28 million lower as a result of the devaluation we experienced in most key currencies versus last year, offset by favorable hedge positions and the positive impact of lapping year ago foreign currency losses. Over the next several quarters, we expect downward pressure on gross margins as a result of the devaluation we are experiencing in most key currencies. The adverse financial impact of devaluation will be somewhat tempered in the near term by our currency hedges.","As a percent of revenue, gross margin increased to 34.7% or up 1.0 percentage points versus last year's third quarter. We are very pleased with our gross margin performance during the quarter and the first 9 months. However, we expect fourth quarter gross margin percent to be roughly in line with last year's fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter gross margin percent will include productivity gains and improved mix, but will be offset by unfavorable foreign currency and significantly lower production levels as compared to last year.","Operating margin for the quarter fell by $35.9 million, driven by lower gross margin as a result of lower shipments. As a percent of revenue, operating margin fell 1.4 points during the quarter on lower revenues, with largely flat SG&A and restructuring spending. On a year-to-date basis, operating margin is up 26% to $662 million. And as a percent of revenue, operating margin was up 2.3 points versus prior year. SG&A was $224.0 million or 0.8% higher during the quarter compared to quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A to be modestly below prior year spending of $266 million. Q4 SG&A will reflect the impact of 5 fewer calendar days in the quarter, which equates to roughly $8 million in lower expenses and reflects the lapping of last year's recall expense of $12 million. Favorability from these items will be partially offset by a moderate increase in spending in the fourth quarter to support our growth initiatives. We continue to expect full year SG&A spending will increase over last year as we invest in growth, but will decrease as a percent of revenue.","Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 21. HDFS operating profit was $72.4 million, up 16.7% compared to last year's third quarter. I would like to highlight 2 items on the year-over-year comparison. First, the provision for wholesale loan losses was unfavorable at $4.8 million, driven by a reserve release for last year's third quarter. Second, the key driver of HDFS' operating growth of $10.4 million in the quarter was an improvement in net interest income. This was largely driven by the lapping of prior year loss of $8.7 million on the early repurchase of a portion of our 6.8% medium-term notes in Q3 of 2011. Based on continued strong credit loss performance and a more favorable cost of funds, we now believe HDFS' full year operating profit will improve slightly over last year.","Now, I will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 22. During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 2.5% or $15.6 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by growth in used motorcycle loan originations, partially offset by a decline in new motorcycle loan originations, consistent with lower retail sales in the U.S. During the quarter, our market share of new retail motorcycle lending was up slightly at 52.3%. Originations in Q3 were approximately 80% prime. Total finance receivables outstanding decreased 0.2% compared to a year ago, primarily due to a declining retail portfolio. Retail finance receivables outstanding decreased 1.5% compared to a year ago, partially offset by wholesale finance receivables, which were up 9.5% compared to last year. We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and the credit loss -- retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 23.","The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the third quarter was 3.24% or 49 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses were at their lowest level in over 10 years.","For the third quarter, retail credit losses came in at 65 basis points, considerably lower than prior year of 111 basis points. This favorable credit loss performance was driven by our continued strong underwriting, collection and loss mitigation efforts, as well as consumer behavior in managing their credit in the U.S. While we continue to be disciplined in how we manage the loan portfolio and the overall business, we have no assurance that the current consumer behavior will continue. In fact, we expect retail credit losses to increase over time, due to customers taking on additional debt, HDFS' efforts to find more prudently structured loan approvals in the near prime and subprime lending, and lower recoveries resulting from lower charge-offs than prior periods. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and prudently managing the business, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 24. You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.93 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had $1.55 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have, and intend to continue to maintain, a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. We ended the quarter with higher than typical cash balances. This was due to the timing of our funding activities. During the quarter, we took advantage of the very favorable debt markets and completed 2 transactions, both which represent all-time low interest rates -- interest cost to HDFS. First, in July, HDFS completed a $675 million asset-backed securitization at a weighted average interest rate of 0.81%. And second, in September, HDFS completed the sale of $600 million of 3-year notes with an interest rate of 1.15%. Through the fourth quarter, we expect our cash balance to come down and be in line with our cash strategy to hold 12 months of projected liquidity in cash or committed credit facilities. Additionally, we established a $200 million Canadian conduit facility to more efficiently finance Canadian retail receivables, and we renewed our $600 million U.S. conduit facility. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $85 million. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now I'd like to highlight 2 items on Slide 25, which provide the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials. First, the company provided operating cash of $712.5 million during the first 9 months, compared to $901.6 million provided in 2011. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in working capital and an increase in HDFS wholesale receivables due to the timing of shipments in the third quarter. The motorcycle business generated year-to-date operating cash of $496 million. Second, the effective tax rate was higher this quarter versus last year's third quarter, which included a favorable settlement of an IRS audit, as well as a favorable change in the Wisconsin income tax law associated with certain net operating losses.","On Slide 26, you'll see that for 2012, we continue to expect motorcycle shipments to be 245,000 to 250,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up 5% to 7% from 2011. During the third quarter (sic) [fourth quarter], we expect to ship 44,500 to 49,500 units, which is down 2% to 12% compared to last year, as we move production closer to seasonal demand. We expect fourth quarter gross margin percent to be roughly in line with last year's fourth quarter gross margin. As we expect Q4 gross margin percent will include productivity gains and improved mix, which will be offset by unfavorable foreign currency and significantly lower production levels as compared to last year. We expect Q4 production to be down versus prior year for the following reasons: First, we plan to implement flexible production at York in the first quarter of 2013; second, we will not repeat the build of 7,000 additional motorcycles in the fourth quarter of 2011 to support the ERP launch; and third, because there will be 5 fewer days in the fiscal Q4 calendar compared to last year's fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 gross margin of 34.75% to 35.75%. Finally, we continue to expect 2012 capital expenditures to be $190 million to $210 million, which includes approximately $35 million of capital related restructuring.","Amy Giuffre","John, let me just clarify quickly. You said that we're shipping 44,500 to 49,500 in the third quarter, it's the fourth quarter.","John A. Olin","In the fourth quarter, sorry.","Keith E. Wandell","That was Slide 26.","John A. Olin","On Slide 26. Thank you. As we look back on the third quarter of 2012, our overall results were in line with our expectations. We exited the third quarter with good sales momentum in the U.S. and slightly higher retail inventory than the prior year. We posted strong international retail sales despite challenging world economies. We kicked off our 110th Anniversary year. We launched an exciting lineup of 2013 model year motorcycles. HDFS continues to perform very well, and during the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our stock. Today, we are thrilled that our ERP launch in York is nearly complete. It's a huge step in our progress towards transforming to world-class manufacturing. We remain focused on executing against our strategies as we complete the final activities in our manufacturing restructuring, continue to transform our organization and grow our business, while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson.","And now let's open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I apologize if I missed this, but are you still committed to undershipping retail sales in 2012 and then I have just a follow-up after that.","John A. Olin","Yes, Ed. We would expect that on a full year basis, our dealers in the U.S. will retail more than we ship by a slight amount.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as far as kind of Q3 is concerned, leaving some sales on the table just given the production, September production issues, did that meaningfully affect your mix of outreach versus core customers, since core riders tend to be more inclined to buy touring bikes? And then secondly, when do you expect the lost sales to be recovered? I'm just trying to understand if that business comes back in Q4 or if maybe it sort of just gets pushed into next year?","John A. Olin","Well, as we talked about, retail sales in the quarter were certainly affected by the low retail inventories. And basically, we had retail sales down in July, August and the first part of September, and the reason being is inventories were extremely low during that period of time. As inventories at York came back, certainly retail sales came back as well. Ed, you had asked about the type of mix in the system. The answer is, yes, the mix skewed more toward outreach customers in the third quarter. So a lot of our touring bikes are sold -- well, some of them are sold to outreach as well. Actually, the Street Glide is the top-selling bike to our outreach youth, as well as women. Most of the touring bikes are to core customers. So that would have an impact. We did see sales to outreach customers outstrip that of core in the third quarter. As Keith had mentioned, we've seen that for the last 3 quarters. And when we talk about the sales, they were clearly affected by retail inventory, and let me kind of put a little bit more to that. If you look at the 13 weeks within the quarter, and you look at our product of York, the bikes we make out of York in the inventory. Of those 13 weeks, 11 of those weeks were below prior year levels. And remember, a year ago, we said that inventory in the third quarter was very tight and lower than desired. Of those 11 weeks, Ed, 9 of them were down double digit. And touring bikes, which has been our hottest seller and the most in demand and the most constrained, inventory fell at one point during the quarter to over 40% down. So clearly, the pump ran dry in the third quarter. And it took us since the time we started reshipping in the third week of August, about 8 weeks, to catch up on inventory at York. But once inventory started to approach year-ago levels, especially of York product, we saw retail sales really come back.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I think on several of the Analyst Days, Keith, you've talked about kind of getting back to Harley's roots in innovation and kind of how that would impact models in years going forward. And I guess, this model year changeover, it looks more like tweaks to existing models, rather than what I would call real innovation. So I was hoping you could give us some insight to what we should be expecting in the next 2 or 3 years and whether you think that innovation will be more critical to the U.S. consumer or more geared towards the international consumer?","Keith E. Wandell","Okay. That's a great question. But first, of all, let me just sort of set the backdrop again. So the year is 2009, sales are off 40%, revenues are down significantly. And so, we've got a reduced budget around spending in the whole business, including product development. So that's number one. Number two, is we are taking the reduced amount of money that we're spending on product development, and we're developing products for Buell, MV Agusta, as well as Harley. So I think you can sort of get the idea that we were sort of constraining the amount of development, innovation and new products that were pertinent to the Harley-Davidson brand, number one. And you lay over that the fact that at the time, 4 of these new products that you're talking about, which are the new innovative products, not just the tweaks or the sort of the model refreshes, it was about 5- to 5.5-year product development process. So 2009, that takes us out to 2014 and 1\/2 before you would see any new products coming through. But remember, that we were constrained on what we were developing in that time. So what we've done is, in addition to focusing strictly on the Harley-Davidson brand by getting out of Buell, selling MV Agusta, et cetera, putting more money into product development, we've also shortened the development time through a lot of really hard, diligent work. And so the answer to your question is, if you think about the timeframe of the new product development process being late 2010, 2011, we're into the 2015 timeframe before we really start to see a lot of these products with the new innovation that are focused on international markets, outreach customers and core customers. And we do have products in development that are exciting, that I think, and we all believe, will inspire every one of those markets that we just mentioned. And just so you know, Sharon, this is one of our biggest frustrations in the company. Because we would like to have these products here today. But given all the things that I just mentioned, it just simply isn't possible. All I can tell you is, and while we don't talk about specific products that are in development, all I can tell you is, I think that we, our employees here, I think we're more excited today about the array of products that we have under development, that we're going to be bringing to market, than maybe we've ever been in the history of our company.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, I just wanted to hit on the inefficiencies. As you mentioned, you worked a little bit of extra unexpected overtime, and you're looking for a $32 million to $35 million. As you wrap up some on the restructurings looking into next year, should we see those inefficiencies year-over-year largely drop off? I know there may be some residuals, but any color you can give us from that perspective? And then in the quarter here, your inventories were up, which is just a little confusing at the company level. Just maybe walk us through the whys of that portion.","John A. Olin","Okay Tim, with regards to the temporary inefficiencies, again, these are things that are important to our transformation, but from an accounting standpoint, can't be included in restructuring expense. And we expect this year for them to be $32 million to $35 million. And last year, they were $32 million. Next year, as the restructuring ends, we will start to see these dissipate over the next 2 years. And so, we would see, call it, 1\/2 of them fall off next year and then the other 1\/2 in 2014. The second question is with regards to inventories, and inventories on a year-over-year basis were up a bit. And that's driven by a couple of things. One, our related business' inventory is up, in particular on General Merchandise. And remember, we entered the year in the third quarter with our new 110th Anniversary product. So that's driving inventories up as we supply the world with those highly-desired products. As well, as inventory is up a little bit in international finished goods motorcycles, roughly 1,000 units. And we've had strong sales in international in the third quarter.","Keith E. Wandell","Tim, let me -- this is Keith. I just want to add something here too, because I know there's this question about inefficiencies, et cetera, in York, and I just want to make sure that I'm clear about what we're doing there. As you know, I've personally been involved in many new systems implementations. Not just SAP, but Microsoft and -- I mean, not Microsoft, but PMFG Pro, et cetera, over the years, and I have never seen an implementation that has gone even remotely as well as what's happened in this company. I mean, it's absolutely a tribute to all of our employees, the focus, not only of our employees, but also the folks from SAP and other consultants that were involved in the process. And I would say that on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being an absolute perfect launch, we were at 9.2. And we had some issues, certainly, coming out of the launch that caused issues to slow down production. Our folks have worked hard and diligently to fix those as we've gone along, a very methodical and focused initiative and effort. And we're beyond that. And our run rates are where they need to be, and there's only upside in our manufacturing plants going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Two quick ones. Did the delayed model year 2013 launch impact international demand in the same way as it did in the U.S.? And could you also address used bike prices?","John A. Olin","Yes, the pushed out model year would have some effect on international. But remember, the distribution system is a little bit different in international. We have pools of inventory in our international markets. But as we delay the model year launch, it did push out -- I'm sorry, as we retime the model year launch, which is now going to be in August in the future as well, is that just pushed out the shipments of those new models, and it takes about a month for them to get into market. So yes, it would push out sales in international markets as well. Yes?","Keith E. Wandell","Used bike prices.","John A. Olin","And I'm sorry, used bike prices. From the fourth quarter of last year, used bike prices have been very stable, and the gap between used and new bikes have been stable in the first, second and third quarter -- I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter of last year, first and second. Also during those 3 quarters, we've seen used grow faster than -- I'm sorry, new grow faster than used. We did see a reversal in that in the first 2 months of the third quarter, where used grew faster than retail -- I'm sorry, new. And that was because new fell, and we continue to sell a fair amount of used bikes. But overall, we feel very good about the gap between new and used bike prices and do not think that, that's going to hinder us in growing new bike sales into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Regarding the cadence of the retail sales in the quarter, obviously, very positive, and I understand the alignment of distribution [ph] there. But there has been an argument that September picked up also because of pent-up demand. So I'm just wondering if you can provide any color of what you've been seeing lately in October and maybe your expectation for the rest of the year?","John A. Olin","Well, we clearly saw a pickup in retail sales in the last 3 weeks of September. And again, as I had mentioned, as the York inventory in particular got close to year-ago levels, sales began to certainly rise. Felicia, we feel great about the brand. We feel great about the brand's strength. To tease out what piece is what, it's really hard to do. Clearly, our retail sales during the quarter were affected by lack of product availability. When the availability was restored, retail sales came back quite strong, and we exited the quarter with a fair amount of momentum. And when we look forward, it's also hard to tell. In the first quarter, we pulled sales into the first quarter given the good weather. And in the third quarter, we may have pushed some sales out of the third quarter, and we may pick those up in the fourth quarter or people may wait until spring. But the point is, is that the brand is still very strong. Our market share position is still very strong and there's a lot of demand for the product. And we don't provide a future look at retail sales. So right now, we feel good about where we're at on a year-to-date basis.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could just help us think through this surge capacity and how to model for it. Should we assume that the historical quarterly changes in the -- I'm sorry, the historical sequential quarterly changes in dealer inventories declines or even gets close to 0? And then you said that the surge will be up in the first quarter, but is it -- how should we think about that in terms of timing within the first quarter, like should we credit our first quarter model for that?","John A. Olin","Okay. Let's take a step back on everything that we're trying to do here. Is given the fact that we've now got new capabilities from a manufacturing perspective, and that's what the restructuring has been all about, we've got the capability to produce much more flexibly and produce when our customers want the product. So this year, 2012, we took the opportunity, and we shipped in the first half more motorcycles than we retailed. That is the first time that, that's happened in well over a decade. Typically, what we do is retail about 57% of our year's production, and we ship in only 50%. So in 2012, we took the first step toward realizing our new capability, and we shipped in more bikes in the first half. A lot of those came from inventory. The next step is what's going to take place at York in the first half of next year. And we will now produce the same way that we ship. So we'll be able to -- and be capable of producing a lot more in the first half as we bring on flexible workers and get more capacity utilization out of our facilities. And what that will do is have somewhat of an impact on gross margin between quarters. But next year, we would expect to link our shipments and our productions pretty tightly. The third piece of it is making sure that inventories are also in line with our new flexible manufacturing capability. And as we look to next year, we would expect to put more inventory in the dealer channel in the first, second and third quarter and take some out of the fourth quarter of next year. Just like we are this year, and that's because Kansas City will also be moving to flexible production in the beginning of 2014.","Keith E. Wandell","I'm going to jump back in here, John, because I'm excited. And I'm going to say it again, I've been in this thing for 38 years. I have never seen an effort like what we've had in this company in the last couple of years to get us repositioned in manufacturing for the future. And it's now our labor unions that have stepped up and in spite of very difficult changes, have been all-in. Our employees, all-in, our leadership. And I mean what's been accomplished here is exceptional. And I'm just going to keep saying that because we're -- 2 years ago, we were on a call with the same folks here, we were asked about the restructuring, and in spite of the unbelievable amount of work that needed to be done, what we said was, \"Coming out of 2012, we would be completed.\" Right?","John A. Olin","Yes.","Keith E. Wandell","And that's exactly what happened. And there's been some puts and takes along the way, as you might expect, but it's absolutely awesome.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","A question on gross margins. You said you expect that to be flat in the fourth quarter. I think all the color that you gave on that front was really helpful. But that basically gets me, I guess, at best, to the very low end of your guidance for the full year, if I'm doing the math correctly. I guess versus where you were coming into the year, how have gross margins trended? It seems like maybe a little bit worse? Did that ultimately get affected by the production shortages we saw in the fourth quarter? But ultimately, how should I think about that?","John A. Olin","Overall gross margin, again, is expected to be 34.75% to 35.75%, James. As we exit the third quarter, we're sitting at 35.6%, which is toward the high end of the range. But you got to look historically at our gross margin percents and the fourth quarter is always our lowest gross margin quarter. And it's typically down anywhere between 2 and 5 percentage points from the previous 3 quarters' run rate and next year is no different. The fourth quarter will fall off, and that's because of the fact that we produce much less. And as we look at the fourth quarter of this year, the growth that we've been experiencing through the first 3 quarters of this year, which is up 1.6 points of gross margin, we don't expect to be there, because of the fact that production will be significantly lower and foreign currency will be lower. But again, we do expect to be in the 34.75% to 35.75%.","Operator","You're next question comes from Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I just have one housekeeping and maybe one slightly longer question. You went through the temporary, John, you know what you expected for the year for the temporary inefficiencies, and what you had done year-to-date, or I'm sorry, for the third quarter. Can you just remind me what that implies for the fourth? Just one little housekeeping item there. And then second question is on international inventories. You've been shipping, I believe, if my numbers are right, ahead of sales for the first 3 quarters of the year, and correct me if I'm wrong on that. How do you see the balance between shipments and retail sales playing out, maybe for the fourth quarter and then beyond the fourth quarter? Are you still building a lot of inventory because you're opening a lot of dealerships there? Or should we expect the sales and the shipments to be sort of similar on a go-forward basis?","John A. Olin","Thanks, Patrick. Temporary inefficiencies, I think was the first question. And we expect temporary inefficiencies of $5 million to $8 million in the fourth quarter. Secondly was a question on international inventory. I think as we ended the quarter, we're up about 800 units in international inventory based on, one, increasing dealerships; and two, the growth that we expect out of international. International is no different than the U.S. We're going to continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand, and we feel very good about our overall inventories in the international arena. Again, they're up slightly in the third quarter, as were the domestic inventories, up about 3,100 units in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Pat Nolan on for Rod. Most of my questions have been answered, so just 2 follow-ups. On the surge capacity, I think it's pretty clear that you'll be able to take down your inventories on the corporate level, based on being able to clearly match production to your shipments. But on a full year basis at the dealer level, would you expect that you would grow dealer inventories in 2013?","John A. Olin","No. We would expect dealer inventories to be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. But Pat, we expect them to be higher throughout the first 3 quarters. And so, we've been working through limited supply of motorcycles, and we would expect to replenish those in the first, second and third quarters. But given the fact that our fourth quarter -- is only about 17% of retail sales happens in the fourth quarter and 22% in the first quarter, we don't need as much inventory sitting in dealers. And when you have inventory that you don't need sitting in dealerships, it's inevitably going to end up being the wrong inventory. So that's what we're doing in terms of our flexible manufacturing, is we're going to wait longer to read the market better and to put inventory into the dealerships when they need it and in time for the spring selling season. So ultimately, we would expect dealer inventory to come down slightly this year, 2012, and slightly in 2013. We're not talking huge moves, but it will be down a little bit because we have the capability of making the product when the customers want them.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And on retail sales in the quarter, I think it makes a lot of sense that you're inventory constrained, but it's a little bit surprising that the overall industry was down 5%. I know you're a high 50% of the industry. But I'm surprised the rest of the industry wasn't positive in the quarter. Could you maybe give some color about what's going on within the industry? I would've thought with what's going on in the credit availability, that would've helped demand, but it seems that the overall industry was kind of weak in the quarter as well.","John A. Olin","I think the first comment that you made, Pat, is the most important. Is we're at 57% of the market. And with us being down 5.2%, used bikes, overall industry is going to fall a fair amount as well. If you look at total demand, overall industry through August is up about 6.5%, so very healthy. We're up about 9% in total demand. So the industry, the competition is still selling a lot more bikes. They're still selling though, more used is growing faster than their new. And again, we hit an inflection point about 3, 4 quarters ago, and they haven't reached that point yet. So the competition is selling a lot of motorcycles, more of them being new than used.","Keith E. Wandell","Used than new.","John A. Olin","I'm sorry, more of them used than new.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","The first question I have is, you guys talked a little bit about how you're expanding the international dealer base, but can you talk about how you feel about the domestic dealer base and whether or not you're looking to continue to kind of weed out any sort of underperformers or improve them? And then also, any insight on what you've had to do to keep EMEA sales decent or robust, however you'd like to look at that?","Keith E. Wandell","Let me take the first part of that, John, on the dealers. Jaime, we've, over the last 2.5 probably years, we recognized early on, particularly in light of the fact that sales had fallen from the 2006-2007 timeframe significantly, that our dealer network was, particularly in the U.S., was somewhat under stress financially, and that we probably had too many dealers, and particularly, we were over-dealered in '09 or '10 or '11, whatever it was, major metropolitan markets. So we worked extremely hard with our dealer network and have been successful in probably closing maybe 100 or so dealer points.","John A. Olin","86.","Keith E. Wandell","86, okay. So in that timeframe. So given sort of where the market is today and that restructured dealer network, we feel pretty confident today that we're appropriately dealered in the U.S. Now I don't know what that means a year from now or 2 years from now, but that's something that we have to continually watch and monitor and make sure that we're working hard to maximize our dealer network, because it's extremely important that we have a financially sound dealer network so that, that translates to every day, a great customer experience. And we do know, because we have access to all of our dealers' financials, that there has been significant improvement over the last couple of years in terms of dealer profitability, et cetera. On the other hand, we also knew that there was untapped potential in the international markets, and not just in the developed markets, but also in the emerging markets. And so, as early as 2009, we said we were going to add 100 to 150 dealerships between then and 2014 in strategic areas. We've been doing that. We're on track. And it's paying dividends in terms of better penetration in the international markets and getting greater access to the brand for the customers around the world that are desirous of participating in the Harley-Davidson brand.","John A. Olin","And the other question that you asked was on EMEA sales. We're clearly actively managing the situation. It is very volatile, and we saw sales down in the first and second quarter, we're pleased to see them up in the third quarter. But the team there is actively managing from an inventory standpoint, and our pipeline distribution system helps that, to make sure that we've got the right motorcycles at the right place and the motorcycles out where they're selling. And again, we have got the tale of 2 markets in Europe. The north seems to be continuing to grow very well, and the south is very soft. So they're working on making sure that inventory is in the right place. They continue to fuel the emerging markets and adding dealerships and filling out in emerging markets. And then finally, allocating overall resources and rationalizing where appropriate. So the situation is difficult, we don't expect it to go away. We expect it to continue for some time, and the team there is doing an absolutely fantastic job of managing the situation the best they can.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Hovorka of Raymond James.","Joseph D. Hovorka - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First, just a follow-up on what James was asking about the gross margin. It doesn't seem like the fourth quarter guidance and in the full year would be [indiscernible]. If you use the -- the low end of your production guidance would get you to about 34.75% in gross margin, if gross margin was flat quarter to quarter, to the extent that production would go up on that, you'd be below that for the full year. So it would seem that it would have to be up in the fourth quarter to hit your full year guidance.","John A. Olin","Well, on a weighted average basis, we will be roughly in line with Q4's last year's guidance and that will equate to a gross margin of between, on a full year basis, of 34.75% to 35.75%.","Operator","Your last question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First is, the last couple of Q1s you've made pension contributions around $200 million each year. I was wondering if you have a sense yet of how much of your cash may go to that in Q1 of 2013? And then my second question is, just trying to get clarification on your comment about the uptick in sales in the month of September versus how the full quarter came in. And you said the model year, the retiming hurt sales early in the quarter, and then you mentioned this momentum in September, are you suggesting the increase in September is more than just a model year shift? In other words, are you thinking or should we be thinking about it as an inflection point? Or are you saying that was the model year shift that helped September after hurting August? And then the pension question.","John A. Olin","Okay, Robin. From a pension standpoint, we haven't marked the assets. So what happens in the pension accounting is, is we will mark at the end of the year and given where current discount rates are, we would expect the liability to increase as we exit this year, because the discount is a huge driver of that liability. At the end of the year, we'll evaluate what pension liability looks like, what we're obligated to do. Right now, our pension plans are well-funded. We feel very good about where we're at, but we do expect that liability to increase. And at that time, we'll evaluate it, making sure that we keep a very strong and healthy balance sheet. And at that time, we'll decide if we need to contribute more funds. The second is the uptick in September is -- the majority or -- it's hard to segment how much is due to the underlying momentum and demand for the brand versus some of the sales that were pushed out of July and August into later September. So there's no way for us to exactly quantify it. What we do see is that we've -- in the last 3 weeks of September, in particular, as York inventory or product of York inventories came back to year-ago levels, we saw very strong momentum as we exited the quarter in the back half of September.","Operator","There are no further questions queued up at this time.

Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, our CEO Matt Levatich and CFO John Olin will be hosting.","Matt, let's get started.","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Amy, and thank you everyone, for joining us on the call today.","As you know, this is my first earnings call as President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, but this is far from my first earnings cycle here. As a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson team, I'm not only incredibly proud of where this company has been, I'm incredibly excited about where we are going.","You've all read the headlines and results in the news release this morning. Sales, shipments and earnings are in line with our expectations. As always, John will go into the detailed financials behind that in a few minutes, but first I want to take a second and talk about the big picture of the quarter, the environment we are in, and why I'm encouraged about both our performance and our prospects.","In April, we acknowledged the environment was going to be difficult in the face of currency and discounting by competitors. But we didn't sit on our hands, we leveraged our strengths, pulled together as a team, and came to the table to compete and win.","The tough call in April to take down shipments was the right call, and reflects our long-standing commitment to manage supply in line with demand. The fact that we delivered shipments in line with that guidance in the second quarter, while maintaining near record gross margin, shows the strength and flexibility we have built on the operations side of the business.","But of equal or greater importance in my mind is our commitment to drive demand, and do so in ways that are reinforcing of our premium brand. Harley-Davidson has powerful fundamental strength and assets, and we leverage some of the many competitive advantages we have like HDFS, our riding academy, our richly iconic brand, and our great dealer network to drive demand in the quarter.","For example, in the US we implemented targeted financing offers through HDFS. And we rolled out free rider training to active and veteran military personnel through our riding academy. The outstanding response to the riding academy program reflects its power and potential as a conduit to the sport through our brand, our retail channel, and through great products like the Street, which we use in support of riding academy training.","We believe that taken together, our actions to drive demand have had a positive impact on retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increasing momentum in the US, with near double-digit growth in June's retail sales of new Harleys. In fact, it was our strongest June retail motorcycle sales in the United States since 2008. In Europe, we also stepped up our marketing efforts, and saw growth in new motorcycle sales return in June.","At the same time, sales of new Harleys in the Asia-Pacific region were up strongly in the quarter, driven in part by the great reception to our Street motorcycles in particular in China and India. In fact, the Harley-Davidson Street 750 was the best-selling new Harley ever in the region when it comes to first-year sales.","Street has also been very successful in bringing new riders into the Harley-Davidson brand, both in the US and internationally. In its initial year alone, 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street motorcycles in the United States - those customers were new to the brand. In EMEA, it was 9 out of 10. And in the India nearly all Street customers were new to our brand. We believe this success underscores the large untapped potential in our business, not to mention what happens when we deliver for customers with great products like Street, and we will continue to aggressively tap that potential.","During the second quarter, we also demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns when we announced our intent to leverage the current environment and our strong balance sheet to increase share repurchases. This decision was driven by what we believe to be a favorable credit environment and our current share price, which we believe is inordinately influenced by near-term headwinds, including currency exchange rates.","On the operations side, we plan to close on the previously announced transaction with our Canadian distributor in early August and transition to direct distribution in Canada. We have a strong team in place, and look forward to all the opportunities and efficiencies we expect to create in that market.","Looking ahead, we are excited about the 2016 model year motorcycle launch, and bringing our global dealer network together for our annual dealer meeting in late August. The dealer meeting is always a highlight of my year because it's a time when we come together, align, and share in the mutual pride of being in Harley-Davidson motorcycle business, and inspire and motivate the best dealers in the industry.","Before I turn it over to John, I want to reiterate how proud I am of this company, this team, and all the work that's being done at Harley-Davidson each and every day. Every quarter and every year will have challenges, but we can probably all agree that second quarter retail numbers were not as good as we'd all like. We're energized by the challenges and the competition. Headwinds like these are nothing we haven't seen before in our 112 years, we see them as catalysts for getting stronger, and we are.","Make no mistake, driving demand and growing the business are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson. Even as we address the near-term market conditions, our eyes and energy are clearly focused on our strategies for growth and continued industry leadership, long-term. These strategies include rolling out great new products, growing sales to US outreach customers faster than to core, bringing increasing numbers of new customers into the brand internationally, and taking the Harley-Davidson retail experience to new heights, all in ways aimed to make Harley-Davidson the most customer-led company in the world.","We are confident in the strength of our business, our strategies and our team. We are strong in our leadership position. We're managing the business for the long term, and we're here to win.","With that, I'll turn it over to John.","John Olin","Thanks Matt.","Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides.","The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on slide 10.","Results were in line with our expectations, given lower shipments in the quarter following the shipment guidance reduction we took in April. During the quarter, revenue was $1.82 billion, net income was $299.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, all down on lower shipments and ongoing pressure from unfavorable currency exchange.","As expected, operating income from the motorcycle segment was down 19.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Motorcycle segment operating performance continues to be very strong when considering the lower volumes and unfavorable currency impact. The motorcycle business operating margin was down 2.7 percentage points, driven by higher SG&A spending on lower revenues, while gross margin remained very strong at 39.2%.","At HDFS, operating income was up 10.0% year-over-year. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.","Now let's take a closer look at Q2 performance, starting with retail sales on slide 11. As we continued to face a very challenging retail environment in many markets, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the second quarter. In the US, retail sales were down 0.7% as we continued to experience pressure from foreign exchange driven discounting by other brands, and as we lapped last year's strong Rushmore sales. Internationally, retail sales were mainly impacted by new low-priced models from competitors in Europe, currency driven volume declines in markets where we sell in non-local currencies, and challenging economic conditions in some markets.","As we exited the second quarter, our business remains under pressure from increased competitive activity, including aggressive price discounting in the US enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. We have taken action around the world in a manner which will reinforce our brand premium.","We are very pleased that our market actions help drive very strong sales results in the month of June. We remain confident in our worldwide motorcycle shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% for the full year. We expect second half retail sales growth to be driven by our continued demand driving market actions that we've initiated in various world markets, the continued worldwide rollout of our Street motorcycles, ongoing international dealer expansion, the introduction of our 2016 model year motorcycles in late August, and our ongoing brand strength.","We remain focused on delivering the Harley-Davidson customer experience to riders around the world. We expect to grow the appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, expand international sales, and increase sales to outreach customers in the US. We are confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead.","Let's take a look at the US market on slide 12. Second quarter retail sales were down 0.7% in the US. Excluding the fleet of Street motorcycles for rider training registered by dealers during last year's second quarter, sales would have been up 2.1% year-over-year.","We believe the factors that were underlying US retail sales results during the quarter were, first, as expected we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q2 2014 retail sales of touring models were up a very strong 31% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q2 2015. Second, we experienced continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition.","Partially offsetting these challenges, we continued to experience success in our latest Rushmore models launched last August, and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street motorcycle sales continued to drive our performance in small cruisers, which grew double digits year-over-year.","To counter the competitive environment in the US market, we have initiated a three-pronged market action plan, which includes lifestyle and brand advertising and marketing, targeted finance offers, and leveraging HD's other competitive advantages such as riding academy and our dealer network. The bulk of these market driving actions were introduced in late May through mid-June. While it is still early, we believe these activities are having a positive impact on our retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increased momentum resulting in near double-digit growth in June's retail sales.","Turning to market share. During the quarter, US industry grew at 6.8%. We had a very strong market leadership share of 47.5%, and believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter bodes well for motorcycling. However, our Q2 market share was down 2.8 percentage points versus prior year.","While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last three quarters was more severely impacted than we had expected as a result of increased price discounting by the competition and inclusion of auto cycles in the industry numbers. We are pleased to see a moderation in market share loss from the first quarter decline of 4.7 percentage points, and believe the improvement is driven by strong brand strategy and recent market share actions to drive demand in this tough competitive environment.","This is not the first time we\u2019ve experienced period of extreme discounting by competitors and likely it won't be the last. However, we will protect our brand premium. We will not take a short-term view and compete with brand damaging discounting, nor will we ship out of balance with retail demand. We continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long term.","At the end of the second quarter, US retail sales was down approximately 1600 motorcycles on a year-over-year basis.","Amy Giuffre","John, that was retail inventory.","John Olin","US retail inventory was down approximately 1600 motorcycles on a year-over-year basis. Excluding incremental retail dealer fill of Street motorcycles, Q2 retail inventory was down significantly as expected. We were very pleased with inventory levels at the end of Q2. This reflects the benefits of our flexible manufacturing capability, and our commitment to manage supply in line with demand.","On slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.7% in the second quarter. We initiated market actions to counter increased competitive activities and weak economic trends in certain international markets. Similar to the US, we initiated these activities in mid-to-late second quarter, and we were very encouraged by June's retail sales results.","In the EMEA region, retail sales were down as the region experienced the impact of several low-price models introduced by competitive brands and lapped strong year-ago retail sales of 7.0%. In addition, we experienced currency driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in non-local currencies, such as in Russia. Year-to-date Europe market share was 10.2%, down 1.9 percentage points behind the impact of low-priced models introduced by the competition in the performance and standard segments, market segments where Harley-Davidson's motorcycles do not compete.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 16.6% in the quarter. The region experienced growth in all major markets, and in particular in our emerging markets led by India and China. Driving these results is the Street motorcycle, which launched in many Asia-Pacific markets in the first half of 2015.","Street makes entry into the Harley-Davidson brand more attainable for riders around the world, and the early results are very exciting. Retail sales in Japan were up, and they were impacted by the restructuring of distribution in that market, including a new pipeline distribution process and rationalizing the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience.","Latin America region retail sales were down modestly in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil, largely offset by strong growth in Mexico. Retail sales in Brazil continue to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty, and very aggressive price competition.","Finally, retail sales in Canada were down behind a highly competitive environment coinciding with the transition of the business from a distributor to direct distribution.","While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook, given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are confident in our current market efforts and remain focused on the long-term growth strategy. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world, and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders.","On slide 14, you will see wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were down 7.6% compared to last year and within our expected range of 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles. The overall shipment mix reflects higher concentration of Street, as we continue the global rollout of these models. As we exited Q2 2015, we believe US retail inventories in the dealer network were at appropriate levels.","Q2 2015 international shipments were 35.3% of total shipments. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years.","On slide 15, you will see revenue for the motorcycle segment was down in Q2 compared to last year, driven by 7.6% lower motorcycle shipments and unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 4.6%. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $692 from the year ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix partially offset by higher pricing.","Parts and accessories revenue fell 5.4%, driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. General merchandise revenue was up 1.5%, driven by robust international growth, largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.","On slide 16, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 39.2%, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange and lower volumes. During the quarter, overall mix was unfavorable $16.5 million, largely driven by family mix, which included a higher mix of Street motorcycles and a lower mix of touring motorcycles.","Foreign currency exchange was $36.1 million unfavorable for the second quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies. Key currencies devalued an average of 19% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Our Q2 2015 gross margin as a percent of revenue exceeded our expectations, as foreign currency exchange came in better-than-expected behind some strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates within the quarter, and better-than-expected manufacturing productivity. Our Q2 2015 gross margin of 39.2% is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations.","On slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 23.1%, down 2.7 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis, due to increased marketing investment as we address the highly competitive environment. Also SG&A expenses in the quarter included recall reserves of $16.4 million, which included a voluntary recall on touring motorcycles that we incurred late in the quarter.","Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","Now let's take a look at our financial services segment on slide 18. HDFS is a strategic competitive advantage for Harley-Davidson. It enables wholesale and retail sales of the Harley-Davidson motorcycles and delivers attractive returns for the company.","During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased 10.0% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Also HDFS had increase in insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the second quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of the financial services business. The business continued to be very profitable with industry-leading returns.","HDFS' second quarter operations are summarized on slide 19. HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 7.0% compared to last year's second quarter, primarily driven by a 6.8 percentage point increase in our US retail finance market share, and higher average amount financed per motorcycle.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 5.0% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in the retail portfolio. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans, and 20% subprime. As a predominate lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales for the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company.","At the end of the quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.84 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. Finally, during the second quarter, we successfully completed a $500 million asset-backed securitization transaction, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.16%.","Credit performance tracked very well during the quarter. On slide 20, you will see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at June 30, 2015 was 2.71%, or 3 basis points higher than the same period back last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels.","Annual credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.08% compared to last year second quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime originations in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior.","During the second quarter HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position, and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","The Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on slide 21. I'd like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $613.9 million in the first half of this year. Operating cash was up $43.4 million from last year, driven by lower net wholesale lending, partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","Switching our focus to shareholder value on slide 22. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share, and we repurchased 2.8 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $164.8 million. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.","To that end, on slide 23, you will see that last month we announced our plan to add debt to the corporate balance sheet in order to enhance our share repurchase efforts, and deliver additional value to our shareholders. On June 17, we announced that we plan to incur $750 million of long-term debt, with the intent to use the funds to repurchase shares of the company stock.","We expect to incur the debt in the next couple of weeks and complete the share repurchases by the end of this year. The repurchases will be an addition to our ongoing share repurchase plan, which we expect to be in line with last year's second half repurchases of 392 million. We believe this recapitalization is a great opportunity to increase our long-term shareholders ownership in the company without an adverse impact to the long-term value of the brand or the business.","Our guidance is on slide 24. For the full-year 2015, we continue to expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles. Given our first-half results, we have a challenging back half to achieve our shipment guidance. We are confident that we're taking appropriate market actions to accelerate growth in the back half without participating in brand damaging motorcycle discounting. During the third quarter, we expect to ship 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 6.5% to 16.5% compared to last year's third quarter shipments.","For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19%, compared to 18% in 2014. In 2015, we now expect gross margin to be up modestly compared to 2014, impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin to be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange and increased pension expense.","To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full-year motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges, and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 0.75%.","For the third quarter, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates, we expect revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5% with about 40% of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the quarter, reducing gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point.","We now expect SG&A spending will be up modestly in 2015, both in absolute spending and as a percent of revenue, due to the recall expenses and investment in marking driving activities. For HDFS, we now expect operating income to be up modestly in 2015 compared to 2014. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2015 to be between $240 million and $260 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market, and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure.","Finally, we continue to expect full-year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. This guidance does not include the impact of the anticipated Canadian distributor transaction. We expect the financial impact to be dilutive in 2015 to earnings per share by approximately $0.04 behind upfront transition costs. This impact will be realized largely in the third quarter.","So, looking back on the quarter while we are facing significant competitive pressures around the world, we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the second quarter. We successfully maintained a strong gross margin percent despite lower volumes and unfavorable currency exchange, implemented market driving actions which drove June retail sales, expanded distribution of Street into new international markets and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of $165 million in company shares, and announced $0.75 billion recapitalization.","For the second half of 2015, we will navigate a challenging business environment. We remain confident in our shipment guidance and the actions we are taking to support retail sales in the second half of the year. We will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies, and delivering strong margins, strong returns, and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson.","Let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Derrick Johnson","Good morning. I want to follow up on the comments about Street, the strong percentage of Street buyers being new to the brand. Would it mean that the cannibalization of other sportsters was lower than anticipated? I know it's hard to quantify but would these folks have bought a different brand? Would they have bought a different Harley, would they have nothing at all? What other insights can you give us there? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Derrick. When we set out with Street we didn't believe that there would be a ton of cannibalization between our Sportsters and Street motorcycles. They are very different motorcycles intended for a different customer and as we've seen the last year playout, Derrick, we believe that's the case.","You're absolutely right, it's very difficult to pinpoint an absolute percent of cannibalization but we believe it's very low, and some of that is evidenced by the last four quarters, we have seen our small cruisers, which include Sportster and Street, grow well into the double digits behind Street in the United States. Now internationally, certainly most all customers coming in are new to the brand and as Matt had mentioned, 9 out of 10 in Europe are new to the brand and almost all of the folks in India are new. So we couldn't be more excited. The rollout has gone very well internationally and is certainly providing and filling in the role that it was intended to do in the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. John, you seem very confident in the business or maybe they provided you with a ton of energy drinks this morning, but you are confident.","Amy Giuffre","A little of both.","Felicia Hendrix","I was just wondering, you talked in your prepared remarks about how optimistic the second half of the guidance is. I'm wondering if you could just talk about the implied fourth quarter guidance if you take the midpoint of the third quarter and the midpoint of full year that implies unit shipments of 21% in the fourth quarter. So seasonally that just seems high to us given the seasonality and also given the strategy of aligning shipments with demand so if you could touch upon that and just as a follow-up, I was just wondering if you could help us understand the cadence of retail sales in the quarter. I think the conventional wisdom was that retail sales were down earlier in the quarter and then ramped at the end. So I was just wondering if you could address the cadence. Thanks.","John Olin","Thank you, Felicia. So two pieces - let's separate two pieces of the first question, is retail and shipments.","So retail sales were down 1.4% in the first half and we are expecting retail sales certainly to accelerate in the back half of the year that supports our shipment guidance, which is up to 2 to 4 percentage points.","But shifting to the specific question, Felicia, on shipments, if we look at overall shipments in the first half of this year, we were down 4.7% in shipments and as you look at year-to-date, year to go to hit that 2% to 4% shipment growth guidance, we would need our shipments to be up in the back half of 14% to 19%. So let's start out with the half and then we'll get into the two quarters in the back half.","The reason that we're looking to ship more in the back half of the year is not really related to retail sales, it's related to what happened last year. Felicia, if you remember last year we had very tough weather in the United States. And consequently we ended up shipping in more motorcycles in the first half than retail sales warranted. Then we spent the second half taking production and shipments out of the back half to get inventories back in line.","Consequently, last year at the end of the second quarter, our retail inventories were up too high and resulted in more carryover units than we would have liked. So, again our focus is always on aggressively managing supply in line with demand and making sure we're adequately supplying the market. So what we did this year is just to reverse out what happened last year. So we shipped in less this year than we retail in order to bring down second quarter retail inventories this year and we couldn't be happier as to where we're at. As we had mentioned, we're down 1600 units but when you adjust out the Street motorcycles, inventories are down significantly in line with where we believe we need to be to have a very smooth transition into the new model year of 2016 motorcycles.","And consequently because we were down so much in last year's second half in shipments, we will be coinciding [indiscernible] 14% to 19%. What you have done is taken our shipment guidance of 54,000 to 59,000 in the third quarter, and I think that overall shipments, that suggested shipments will be higher in the fourth quarter and that is true.","Now when we look at the back half of those two quarters we're moving production from the first part of the year to the fourth quarter. And the reason being is we've become very good of flexible manufacturing. And we have matched up our production with our demand very well given the manufacturing system that we have. But as we looked at last year that required a fair amount of down days in the fourth quarter and probably hurt efficiencies a little bit. So what we want to do is balance out production a little bit in the back half of the year between the third and fourth quarters.","That will have a little bit of a headwind in terms of gross margin between the third quarter and the fourth quarter but on aggregate it won't have an impact. So again we are smoothing our production a little bit, that's translating into a little bit more shipments in the fourth quarter. The second question that you asked is the cadence in second quarter retail sales. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've got a three-pronged approach to addressing the competitiveness and we're addressing that in Harley-Davidson's way, which is not price discounting. We've talked about this the last time. We will not meet discounting with discounting, we will not put hangtags on our motorcycles. That is certainly the easiest way to address some of the competitiveness we are experiencing in the United States. So with the three-pronged approach most of those activities got into the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June. And we've seen very strong results coming from that and so in April and May, retail sales were pretty soft, softer than what we saw in the first quarter. However June we built very strong momentum and we're near double digits in the United States as well as near double digit in international markets behind the investments that we have made to close that competitive gap.","Operator","Your next questions comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on the shipment guidance. To what extent does it include expectations for retail to accelerate, given new products you hope to announce? And then regarding inventory, to what extent does inventory grow because you have additional distribution points as you have indicated you really want to hold inventory flat otherwise?","John Olin","Thanks, Craig. The bulk of what we're seeing in the shipment cadence and shipping more in the second half than the first half is to correct last year's shipping patterns that were disrupted by the unfavorable weather.","Clearly, as we look at our production as well as our shipments, we're taking into account various market activities, certainly, our new products that are coming out. And so all of that is considered but the biggest driver in the splits of being down in the first half to up in the second half is really what happened last year and getting those inventories in line. When we talk about inventory growth, I would assume, Craig, you are referring to at the end of the year we expect and continue to expect inventory at the end of the year to be flat to up modestly. That does take into account the various models that we have in the marketplace.","And I'm sorry, thank you, Amy. That answer is with regard to the United States that we expect it to be flat to up modestly. Internationally, we do expect inventories to rise as we add new dealer points and we're continuing on a similar pattern of adding dealers that we were in previous years. Actually in the quarter we added 11 new dealers, which we're very thrilled about. So with that internationally we will be putting more inventory to support that growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last point, John. The inventory being flat to up in the US, it seems like previously that was a function of just matching retail growth - so keeping turns constant. Year-to-date you haven't grown retail at all. So is that still how we should think about it, basically the growth in inventory commensurate with the growth in retail? And I guess more broadly, can you speak specifically about market trends that you are seeing, obviously, the Japanese are playing a role, presumably India is playing a role, and I think about those trends going forward which do you expect to get better and when? Does your guidance assumes that no share losses that you have seen in the first half of the year flatten out or maybe even flip into a share gain as we think about third and fourth quarters of this year? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, James. The first question, industry growth and our retail. What we have said is that we expect flat to modestly up growth, and that is tied to basically holding terms flat. However when we look at that, number one is, we are expecting retail growth in the back half and we're certainly expecting to support our shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% withholding those inventories at year-end in the United States. And we're also looking at - when we talk about emerging we're looking at forward turns and what we expect to sell into the future as well. The second question that you had, James, is with regards to market trends.","Why don't we start out with the first half? We have had a tough half largely driven by the price discounting but overall market share was down 3.5 percentage points. The bulk of that share loss is due to price competition in the marketplace. The second biggest driver of the market share loss in the first half was the inclusion of auto cycles in the motorcycle industry numbers, and these are a vehicle that's included that is very car-like. It's got side-by-side seating, gas pedal and brakes, steering wheel, very large front end. It just happens to have a single wheel in the back. States are having trouble figuring out what it is, in terms of, is it a motorcycle, is it registrable, is it an autocycle?","But in any event, we do not believe that it competes directly with traditional motorcycles but it is having a large impact on our overall market share because we are 50% of the market. So those are the two largest drivers of market share losses.","As we move forward we expect certainly our share losses to mitigate. We saw that in the quarter. If you look within the quarter, we kind of talked about the retail sales cadence within the quarter, which improved very much in the previous question but market share as well improved significantly in the quarter as we got some of our market response actions out. So as we move forward we would expect market share's to temper especially in the fourth quarter when we start to lap the initial impact of the price discounting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. A couple questions. John, I apologize, if I missed this but did you talk about gross margin cadence in the back half of the year? Then, secondarily, can you give us any insight on what you were thinking of in terms of pricing actions with model year 2016?","John Olin","Thanks, Sharon. With regards to gross margin when we look at overall headwinds in terms of gross margin for the third quarter, we certainly have a fair amount coming in terms of currency and we do expect it to be a very tough quarter in currency before we start to see some of a year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter. We would expect revenues to be down 5% and the impact on gross margin in the third quarter to be about one full percentage point headwind. And the other piece that we mentioned is, when we were talking about shipment and production cadence, we're moving more production into the fourth quarter and that will have an impact of moving a little bit of gross margin out of the previous quarters into the fourth quarter so that will provide a little bit of a headwind in terms of gross margin in the third quarter as well.","The second question is with regards to pricing action. Pricing as well as seeing our new product, you're going to have to wait until August 24 which is a Monday. We couldn't be more excited to roll out our new products and at that time we will have the new pricing for those products but we don't provide that prior to sharing that with our dealer network. So along with the new products, we are going to have to wait on that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Dave Tamberrino","Thank you. It's actually Dave Tamberrino on for Pat. I will just ask one here on balance sheet optionality. As we think about where you're going to finish 2015, you'll have about half a turn in gross debt and about 0.2 turns in net debt, at least on our forecast. As we think about it what is the range or level that you would be comfortable with in terms of additional debt on the company going forward?","John Olin","Dave, you are speaking with regards to the motorcycle segment. We feel very good about the action that we just took and putting the $750 million debt on there. As we looked at that amount, we looked at certainly making sure that we didn't do anything to affect the long-term business or brand and came out at $0.75 billion at this point. We are not looking to take on any more and we will be focused on executing that in the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thank you. Since you brought up June trends, which were very favorable, I'm guessing that July momentum didn't drop off in a very significant way? And then the second question is you mentioned three initiatives and which do you think had the biggest impact on the June pickup in retail sales?","John Olin","You know, we exited the quarter with good momentum, and we're very pleased with that. We are reporting results as of the end of the second quarter, and we're not going to go beyond that. But again what we saw in the first quarter and the change and shift in momentum we feel very good about the overall second half.","The second question is with regards to what we had talked about in addressing some of the competitive issues. We've got a three-pronged approach, and you can see most notably in there is brand damaging discounting is not a part of it. So we're very pleased with what we've got. It's not as easy, it's not as quick. We've got to be a lot more creative in how we do it, and the results are very strong.","But when we look at the various pieces, they all work in concert with each other. When you look at the lifestyle and brand advertising, that's an investment in the future and an investment in the brand, in the brand premium. Hard to measure what that does on a day-to-day basis. The second piece of it is targeted finance offers. That is trying to close some of that competitive gap that we have in the marketplace. No, we haven't talked much about discounting but it certainly has not improved on a quarter-over-quarter business. It remains consistent to a little bit increased. We are seeing a couple more competitors and we're also seeing the level go up a little bit, now the top discount out there is $4000 a motorcycle.","So the targeted finance offers are just that, very targeted and they allow us to work on some of that price gap. I will also say that being able to do this with HDFS is absolutely a fantastic benefit and advantage to us. We've immediately got over 700 dealers in the United States. We can access them. We can offer the same thing and we can get execution, very pristine across the US and certainly HDFS is proving to be a tremendous advantage.","And then the last piece is really leveraging some of our competitive advantages, things that we have that no one else does. First and foremost is the dealer network and getting their focus where we need it to be. And the second are our assets such as rider academy. So a program like this and Matt had mentioned it in his prepared remarks as we offered free rider training to all veterans and active military folks and this is an incredibly brand enhancing opportunity for us. And it comes at a very efficient price.","So we're not seeing the benefits of that in the first half. We launched that in the middle of May and we've seen overwhelming response of interest and what it's going to take is folks getting enrolled in riding academy, complete the course and then purchase the motorcycle. So this is something that's going to drive more in the second half certainly than it did in the first half and be a very strong brand enhancing point with about a third of our customers buying new motorcycles in any given year.","Matt Levatich","I will just add. This is Matt. I think the energy that we've put in in the quarter is around really smart creative reinforcing ways to compete. So as an example we've talked a lot internally about the simple truth that $1 invested in pulling forward a sale is $1 wasted. So our energy is around high-quality things that convey the core meaning, the core value of joining the Harley-Davidson brand versus another choice people might have. I think the rider academy veterans program is a great example of the great work that we're doing internally to do smart things to grow the business long-term. As John mentioned, practically none of that investment is in the second quarter numbers yet but we couldn't be more impressed with the response in numbers and in the nature of the response as far as how people are feeling about Harley-Davidson's investment in our veterans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kevin Milota","Hi, thank you. Just on the $750 million debt issuance - it sounds like you're in the market right now - what pricing our you expecting to achieve on that debt?","John Olin","Thanks, Kevin. We are not in the market at this point. We expect to be in the market very quickly in the next couple of weeks. And we certainly look for a price commensurate with our ratings and the team here, the treasury team does a fantastic job but at this time I'm not going to speculate on what we believe we will get. Markets are dynamic and change. But we should be in the market in the next couple of weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you and thanks for the color on the gross margin, in particular the FX cadence, very helpful. Mostly clarifications here touring, John, you commented on sort of the cadence of your shipments in there but touring was down noticeably here in the second quarter year-over-year, so some comments there. And then Canada, any additional color you can give there related to the accretion for next year and then finally just as a reminder the HDFS financing promotions, where does that flow through in the P&L? Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks, Tim. So touring shipments. Tim, what you are referring to is on the shipment slide. When we look at percent of total, Street was basically up 4 percentage points and touring was down 4, and we expected this as we entered into the quarter. We are continuing to grow our shipments of Street as we fulfill the international rollout and when everything adds up to 100, something has to come down and when we look touring is down and the previous four quarters we had our cruiser business about 6 percentage points, so there's a lot of concerned with regards to that. But whenever we look at the total and we're investing in different parts of the business something has to come down.","One, we are very thrilled we're seeing stability in the cruiser number in terms of percent of total and there are no issues whatsoever with touring. It's just that as one goes up something's got to come down. And I will say that actually touring is continuing to do very strong. We mentioned that we lapped a 31% increase in the year ago numbers and our Rushmore sales was still up on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, so we're very pleased with that business.","The second question that you had Tim is Canada. So in early August, we expect to step in the shoes of our distributor in Canada. Again we would expect from the overall transaction what's going to happen is that we will receive a little bit more revenue and that is the margin that we pay and have paid our distributor in Canada will go away and we'll distribute directly to our dealers in Canada. So we'll see a tiny bit more revenue. You are not going to be able to see it on the - it won't be a big impact on the whole thing but certainly from a Canada perspective.","And then the second piece of it is that we will also assume the expenses for running the market, so SG&A will increase in the third quarter and ongoing.","Now when we net the higher revenue and the SG&A out over time, that will be beneficial. We'll have more revenue than SG&A and therefore the transaction will be accretive into the future. However in the short-term as we transition there are various things that we need to do from a people standpoint, a systems standpoint, a logistics standpoint, to step into those shoes. And we do expect in the near-term to be - a cost of about $0.04 per share and again by the nature of when we get into this most of that will happen in terms of the third quarter and in terms of higher SG&A spending.","And your final question, Tim, was with regards to HDFS and the finance promotions that were in second quarter. When we look at it, the biggest drivers of those promotions on HDFS were really to originations, which were up 7% and the receivables that were up 5%. When we look at the income, which again had a very strong quarter at HDFS, up 10%, very little of that if any is captured in this. Remember these are 60-month loans. They really got in the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June, so you're picking up maybe 1\/60th of that loan, so very little if any impact in terms of the overall financial performance is due to that activity in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Joe Spak","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is just again, I'm a little bit confused on the shipment versus retail timing shift you explained. I understand the rationale for trying to balance out some of the production and shipments to get some better absorption in the fourth quarter but if retail seasonality doesn't change, how do you not end up with a higher inventory situation, it was the first question. The second question is can you just go over the net interest margin at HDFS in the quarter. It was up but volumes were down and I don't think spreads are getting better. So is there some mix impact there or is it really what you just said on the question prior, which is there's just not that much impact from the current quarter in the issuance of results this quarter?","John Olin","Thanks, Joe. The first question is very simple. We would expect Q3 inventories to be down more than they would have been, and Q4 inventories will end up similar to where we always expected. So we'll balance some of that with just lower inventories going into the fourth quarter, retail inventories.","The second question, Joe, was with regards to HDFS results. We're continuing to see attractive spreads in our business there. If you look at the bridge there you're seeing that net interest income is up I believe $4.6 million and that was due to higher receivables offset by a little bit of lower spreads on the competition, and we've seen that for the last four quarters.","We are not seeing the 0.99 loans that we have in the marketplace playing out in that. As we go forward, we will see a contraction in spread as some of those loans move through. Now some of those loans are also subvented by the motor company. So HDFS is not going to feel the full impact of that. We do very little subvention between companies. I don't think in 2012 or 2013 we did any. Last year we did some because of the excess inventory due to the weather. I think it amounted to about 3% of the overall loan.","So we will see a little bit of tightening of spreads as those loans move through the portfolio but we are not seeing any of it in the second quarter and again overall we feel very good about the business at HDFS.","Hopefully everyone caught the fact that we changed our guidance to be down modestly on a year-over-year basis to be up modestly on a year-over-year basis and the team at HDFS has done an absolutely fantastic job managing that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Good morning everybody. Just two things. One is a lot of talk about the competitive behavior that you are seeing and you stepped up some marketing and maybe subvented financing. But you are seeing still positive pricing of $19 million year-over-year and you saw that in Q1 as well. Just could you help us reconcile really what is happening here that despite the competitive dynamics you were actually still experiencing some positive on the pricing, is the pricing mostly international to mitigate FX? Are there some opportunities in North America that you are seeing as well?","John Olin","Thanks Rod. The pricing where - we typically take pricing at model year, so the bulk of that $19 million you were seeing on the bridges from pricing that we took last August. Over the last several years we've been taking pricing with the exception of the Rushmore year but net pricing in excess of cost has been about half a percentage point for the last several years and that's what you were seeing in the $19 million. Last year August pricing increased revenue by about 1 percentage point, cost of goods sold increased by about half a percentage point and gross margin was up about half a point. That is simply playing out.","Now interim we did take a little bit of pricing in Europe. Not that much to drive that $19 million, but we raised prices in Europe I believe in late March by 1.2 percentage points and that was to help mitigate some of the currency actions that we saw but the bulk of what you were seeing was done a year ago and again we'll look to provide the market, and you guys with what our pricing looks like for our model year 2016 on August 24.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick one. The HDFS share of motorcycle sales financed was significantly higher than it has been in the past. Is there some level of motorcycle financing where you guys get uncomfortable with bearing sort of most of those loans or where it starts to constrain sales or is there sort of no bound on that?","John Olin","Hi, Jamie. To say no bound on that, I don't know how to answer that. Everything we do at HDFS certainly goes through a rigorous underwriting process. We feel very good about the returns on the loans that we take, and we've been very consistent in terms of the financing over these last 10 years. Our market share usually is in the 50% to 55% range. Now having said that, in this quarter given some of the response to the competitive activity we certainly took on more loans. Now to make sure that everyone understands that 0.99 is our very top prime customer, we have three tiers of prime customers and they don't all receive 0.99, that is the FICO scores that are extremely high and losses are extremely low. We do not offer those finance promotions to near prime or to subprime customers. So no, we are not concerned about the credit value - credit aspect of those loans in a way, shape or form as they represent our top customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [Neil] on for Adam Jonas. I wanted to ask about the recent - your views on the recent CFPB ruling on expanded oversight of captive subs. Do you foresee that having an impact on HDFS? If so, could you talk a little bit about that? And then also wanted to ask about residual used car prices, where those have been heading. Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks Adam. So first question on the CFPB. Recently within the last quarter the CFPB made a ruling that finance companies with loans over, I believe, 10,000 in loans would be under the authority of the CFPB, so we fall within that jurisdiction. So we've always been regulated by the FDIC and others and now we will add CFPB to folks that provide oversight to us.","That's the biggest change that we see at this point. We'll continue to monitor it and otherwise shouldn't be any big change. The second question is with regards to use by pricing. In the first half of this year within our dealer network and as we've talked before it's very difficult to really put your finger on used bike pricing. There are 40 or so models, they span over a ten-year period of time and there's all kinds of customization, different levels of customization within models, so it's not an easy thing really to ferret out but the best that we can tell within our dealer network in the first half is that used bike prices are stable. Now within that we're seeing used bike prices firm up a little bit in touring, largely flat in sportsters, and down slightly in our large cruisers and Dynas and Softails. But in aggregate, we're very pleased that used bike prices are holding to year ago levels.","Operator","Your final question today comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes good morning everyone. John, just a question on growth and non-growth in touring. I guess the question is how confident are you [indiscernible] in fourth quarter you can get back to growth?","John Olin","In terms of overall Rushmore, David, we couldn't be more pleased and when we look at just the quarter we're lapping a 31% gain and growing on top of that. Now Road Glide is helping with that. Road Glide represented about 12% of US sales in the second quarter so that helped with that, but in aggregate we feel great about Road Glide. We feel great about the continued sales of Street Glide and the Limited and Road King is in that family as well. And again we're lapping huge numbers and beating them.","Amy Giuffre","Thanks everyone for your questions. The audio recording and slides for today's call will be available at Harley-Davidson.com.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Sue, and welcome to Harley-Davidson\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. The audio for our call is webcast live on harleydavidson.com and you can access the supporting slides on our site by clicking About Harley-Davidson at the bottom of the homepage, then Investor Relations and Events and Presentations. ","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning we\u2019ll hear from Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund. Then, we\u2019ll take some questions.","So let\u2019s get started, Keith?","Keith Wandell","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. John will provide the details on the quarter and the year, but first, I want to highlight some of our major achievements for 2014 and then briefly touch on some of our future opportunities. Full year diluted EPS grew more than 18%, making this the fifth consecutive year of double digit EPS increases. Consolidated revenue topped the $6 billion mark for the first time since 2006. Gross and operating margins were up strongly, driven by our focus on operational efficiencies and our commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our business. A big piece of these improved efficiencies came from manufacturing. 2014 marked our second year of flexible Surge Production. The financial impacts of Surge and all the other improvements in manufacturing in recent years have been remarkable to say nothing of the added flexibility that Surge gives us to capitalize on changing market conditions.","On the product side, our new 2015 motorcycles have been extremely well received. Retail sales of new Project Rushmore motorcycles, including the return of the Road Glide, the introduction of Classic Low and Ultra Limited Low touring bikes, CVO Street Glide and the Freewheeler have been very strong. We also rolled out the Street 750 and 500 last year, designed for a new generation of global riders and the response has been outstanding. And in the fourth quarter, retail sales of Street drove double digit gains in Harley-Davidson\u2019s small cruisers in the United States. To date, the majority of initial US Street purchases have been new to the Harley-Davidson brand. In the international markets, Street is selling very well. And in India, the Street 750 was recently named Motorcycle of the Year. In 2015, Street will be available in nearly all of our markets worldwide.","Also, we continued to see an extraordinary level of interest and positive feedback for a bike that\u2019s not even on the market, Project LiveWire, Harley-Davidson\u2019s first electric motorcycle. In 2014, we gave more than 6800 demo rides in the US, with the vast majority of riders saying that it far exceeded their expectations. The demo tour is moving into Europe, Canada, and Asia Pacific in 2015.","In line with our strategic plan, [indiscernible] increasingly significant role for the company. In 2014, international sales of new Harley-Davidsons grew at more than 5% and accounted for more than 36% of total retail Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales. That\u2019s up from 30% in 2008. We\u2019ve said for several years that we expect international sales to grow at a faster rate than domestic sales. And in 2014, that came into play.","The Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions posted their highest new retail motorcycle sales on record for each region. And we\u2019re also seeing success as a result of our US outreach strategies. In 2014, for the third straight year, sales of new Harleys to our outreach customers consisting of young adults, women, African Americans and Hispanics grew at more than twice the rate of sales to core customers. From Street to Touring, we\u2019re delivering motorcycles that bring these new riders into the Harley-Davidson family. So overall, 2014 was another great year and we remain focused on managing the business for the long term, building on our strategies and driving continuous improvement.","It\u2019s been a little over five years since we unveiled our strategies to focus solely on the Harley-Davidson brand, to be customer led in everything we do, to transform every facet of our business, and ensure we\u2019re developing great leaders at every level of the company to drive our performance. Looking at what we\u2019ve achieved since 2009, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind it was the right strategy and I\u2019m extremely proud of every one of our team and the proof is in the results.","But looking ahead, our strategy will continue to focus on maximizing our opportunities in order to increasingly realize our full potential as a growing global company. That includes what we see as tremendous opportunities in bringing new wow products to market, further extending our international reach, and expanding our opportunities with outreach customers. It also includes further optimizing Harley-Davidson\u2019s agility in manufacturing, product development and customer retail experience.","With ongoing strategic direction and clear focus our business objectives remain extremely relevant: first, outperform the S&P 500 over time; to grow international retail sales at a faster rate than US sales; and within the US, to grow sales to outreach customers at a faster rate than sales to our core customers; and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenue.","So to recap, we\u2019ve seen proof of what can be accomplished through a sound strategy, focus and determination and by working together as one company, one team moving in one direction. We also know our work is never done when it comes to continuous improvement and I have every confidence that we will continue to achieve great things together.","With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your investment in Harley-Davidson and I\u2019ll turn it over to John for more detail on the quarter and the year.","John Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results starting on slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.35 per share. Operating income for the Motorcycle segment was $35.9 million, 40.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was flat to prior year. The decrease in the Motorcycle business operating income was driven by a lower gross margin percent and higher year-over-year SG&A spending.","Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 1.8% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February and a lower effective tax rate. We will continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at fourth quarter performance, starting with retail sales on slide 11. Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 2.8% over last year\u2019s increase of 5.7%. This year\u2019s Q4 results were driven by strong increases in our international markets, partially offset by a decline in the US. Fourth quarter worldwide retail sales reflected an outstanding consumer response to our new 2015 model year motorcycles, including Street, which sold very well in initial rollout markets. Retail sales gains from the new model year bikes were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in retail sales of our initial Rushmore models as we lapped the enthusiastic customer response after the initial launch of Rushmore in 2013.","For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 2.7% compared to 2013. 2014 retail sales reflected very challenging US weather conditions in the first half of the year and the absence of the popular Road Glide models for much of the year. As we exited the fourth quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. In 2015, we expect continued momentum behind our model year 2015 motorcycles, including increased worldwide distribution of Street motorcycles.","Let\u2019s take a look at US market on slide 12. Retail sales in the US were down 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year which included initial Rushmore launch. We believe the factors that affected US retail sales during the quarter were: first, retail sales of the seven new model year 2015 Rushmore models were very strong; as anticipated, Road Glide sales were very robust and they represented about 14% of US retail sales in Q4 versus last year when Road Glide only represented about 4% of sales.","Second, retail sales of the new Street motorcycle appear to be largely incremental. We\u2019re pleased to see that the majority of initial Street purchasers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand, reinforcing the strategic importance of this new growth opportunity. In fact, on a combined basis, retail sales of our Sportster and Street motorcycles were up double digits in the quarter. And finally, our retails sales of the first Rushmore models, which launched in August of 2013, were down year-over-year as we lapped the initial enthusiastic customer response to these highly innovative game-changing motorcycles. Q4 2013 retail sales of non-Road Glide Touring models were up in excess of 40% compared to Q4 2012. That set up a very tough comparison for Q4 2014.","For the full-year, US retail sales were up 1.3%. As I\u2019d mentioned, full year retail sales benefitted from strong sales of Rushmore and Street motorcycles. However, we believe 2014 retail sales were adversely impacted by weather and the absence of Road Glide. Full year market share decreased 1.6 percentage points, largely driven by the absence of Road Glide. We believe our market share was also impacted by increasing discounting by our competitors late in the year. Finally, as expected, US dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2900 motorcycles at the end of 2014 compared to 2013, largely due to the initial dealer fill of Street models for retail. We believe year end dealer inventories is in a good position going into 2015.","On slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 9.2% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the full year. We\u2019re very pleased with our international performance in 2014. In fact, we experienced all-time high retail sales for EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Latin America regions. In our EMEA region, Q4 retail sales were up 8.7%, driven by growth in nearly all countries throughout the region. In particular, we saw strong growth in Southern Europe, Germany, Switzerland, and emerging markets in the region. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were up 6.4% and full year market share in Europe was 12.0%, down 0.8 percentage points behind the introduction of several performance-oriented models by the competition.","In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were up 14.2% for the fourth quarter. Retail sales in emerging markets within the region were up significantly driven by India where retail sales more than doubled during the quarter as a result of very robust demand for our new Street motorcycles. In addition, sales continue to be very strong in China. And in Japan, sales growth turned positive following a couple down quarters which were driven by the impact of an increase in the consumption tax. For the full-year, retail sales were up 11.8% in our Asia Pacific region.","Latin America region retail sales were up 4.7% in the quarter, as a result of strong growth in Mexico, which Brazil up modestly. For the full year, retail sales in the Latin America region were up 2.1%. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 5.7% in the fourth quarter, and down 10.8% for the full year. We believe currency-driven price increases impacted retail sales throughout the year.","While we\u2019re encouraged by fourth quarter international performance, we remain concerned with ongoing economic challenges in several markets. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across the world and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets.","Since 2009, we have added 136 new international dealer points to the distribution network. We believe we can continue to realize strong international growth opportunities by prudently expanding our distribution network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street and Rushmore which appeal to the global customers.","On slide 14, you\u2019ll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 1.2% compared to last year. Fourth quarter shipments finished within our expected range of 46,500 to 51,500 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.5 percentage points from the prior year, as Rushmore models continued to stimulate demand in the market. Also, during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 3.1 percentage points, reflecting our first year of Street shipments.","For the full year, we shipped 9900 Street motorcycles worldwide at the high end of our expected shipment range of 7000 to 10000 motorcycles. We expect that the Street and Sportster category mix will be considerably higher in 2015 behind increased Street shipments. 2014 international shipments as a percentage of the total were 35.7%. We are committed to investing in international growth and continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years.","On slide 15, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was flat in the fourth quarter, with a 1.2% increase in motorcycle shipments. Revenue was primarily impacted by unfavorable currency exchange. For the full year, motorcycle segment revenue was up 5.9%, behind a 3.9% increase in motorcycle shipments.","During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $133 from the year ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the US dollar by approximately 9% compared to Q4 2013.","For the full year 2014, average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $584 from 2013, driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates.","Parts and Accessories sales were down 2.2% in the fourth quarter, and up 0.2% for the full year. For the full year, P&A retail sales benefitted from strong international sales, partially offset by lower accessories sales following the strong launch of Project Rushmore accessories in 2013.","General merchandise was down 1.1% in the quarter, and down 3.7% for the full year compared to 2013. Both the fourth quarter and full-year results were impacted by our aggressive SKU reduction plan across our apparel offering in an effort to transform the retail customer experience with a more targeted assortment of popular styles.","On slide 16, you\u2019ll see gross margin in the quarter was 30.5%, which was 1.0 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well with volume, price, mix, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable foreign currency exchange.","During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $4.4 million, driven by a rich sales mix of parts and accessories and general merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin, driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within the families was largely flat to prior year.","For the first quarter 2015, we expect mix to adversely impact margin, driven by increased shipments of Street motorcycles, which were not in year ago shipment. During the first quarter, we will continue to expand Street distribution to most of Western Europe, Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada.","Foreign currency exchange was $22.8 million unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real, and Australian dollar devalued an average of 6% from the beginning to the end of the quarter and were 9% weaker compared to the prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 2.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign-denominated assets on the balance sheet.","Full year gross margin was 36.4%, which was up 1 percentage point from last year. We are very pleased with our 2014 gross margin growth and the balance composition of margin growth across volume, price, mix and manufacturing productivity.","On slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 3.5%, down 2.4 percentage points compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $35.9 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending.","For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 18.0%, up 1.4 percentage points compared to last year. We\u2019re very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in 2014.","Going forward, we remain intensely focused on the cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on slide 18, in the fourth quarter, HDFS operating profit increased $1.1 million, or 1.8% compared to last year. The fourth quarter increase was driven by $5.4 million of improved profitability from on non-lending activities.","On a full year basis, HDFS posted operating profit of $277.8 million, a decrease of 1.9% compared to 2013. We were very pleased with the performance of the financial services business. The business remains very profitable with industry leading returns and a strong portfolio.","Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS\u2019 operations on slide 19. Larry?","Lawrence Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 4.7% or $22.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.6 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the fourth quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle.","For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the US. Our market share increased to 56.8%, compared to 54.5% in 2013.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 7.4% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. In 2014, approximately 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime.","Moving on to credit performance on slide 20, the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2014 was 3.61%, or 10 basis points lower than year end 2013. This is the lowest year-end 30-day delinquency level in at least 13 years.","Annual retail credit losses increased by 13 basis points to 1.22% compared to 2013, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years and modestly higher credit losses as a result of changing consumer behavior.","We are pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2014, as we continue to contribute strong profitability, delivered solid credit performance and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc., as demonstrated by the $100 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. this month.","Now let me turn it back to John.","John Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on slide 21. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $964.2 million of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.22 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 3-year medium term note offering with a coupon rate of 1.55%. Also this month, we completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%.","We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 3.3 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $222.1 million during the quarter. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.","Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on slide 22. I'd like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $1.15 billion in 2014. Operating cash flow was up $169.6 million from last year, primarily driven by lapping of last year\u2019s pension contribution of $175 million and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations"," And second, the full-year tax rate was 34.2%, compared to 34.1% in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2014, so full year benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter.","The summary for the full-year 2014 is on slide 23. We had net income of $844.6 million in 2014, which was up 15.1% compared to 2013 and earnings per share was up 18.3%. The motorcycle segment operating income was up 15.2% compared to prior year. The motorcycle segment growth was driven by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. As expected, HDFS income was down slightly during 2014 behind higher credit losses. Finally, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February.","On slide 24, you'll see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we expect to ship 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4% to 6% from 2014 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson remains strong.","We expect shipping growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand; great model year 2015 and 2016 motorcycles; full year Road Glide availability, improving availability and expanding distribution of the new Street motorcycles, continuing outreach momentum in the US and international expansion. During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 79,000 and 84,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 4% to down 2% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter shipments.","For 2015, we believe operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 18 and 19%, compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be up modestly impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing, incremental margin driven by higher motorcycle production and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect lower gross margin as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense and unfavorable mix.","To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency held at yesterday\u2019s exchange rates throughout 2015, our motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 2.25%. And while we have a significant portion of the year hedged at attractive rates, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin.","Pension expense will increase in 2015 as a result of a lower discount rate and change in mortality assumptions. Finally, we expect the impact of mix to be negative as we continue to increase distribution of Street motorcycles.","Looking at SG&A, we expect spending to increase in 2015 as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect it will decline as a percent of revenue as we leverage our current SG&A spending.","For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million and $260 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full-year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015.","So looking back, we are very pleased with our 2014 results and key accomplishments. In 2014, we successfully increased sales, gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in an 18.3% increase in diluted earnings per share; expanded our flexible manufacturing capability at our US plants; continue to grow outreach in excess of two times our core customer growth rate in the United States; launched seven new Rushmore motorcycles in the new Street platform; revealed Project Livewire, our first electric motorcycle; expanded our international dealer network; and delivered shareholder value through a dividend increase of 31%; and repurchased $604 million in company's shares.","We're excited about 2015, and we'll continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache. Your line is open.","Pat Nolan","Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan on for Rod. Just wanted to clarify a couple of points on the walk. So John, I think you said it was 3.25% would be the impact of FX at current spot rates and you expect you\u2019ve got half of that impact to your next year?","John Olin","Yes.","Pat Nolan","So if I\u2019m doing the math right, that\u2019s approximately like $15 million or so drag year-over-year?","John Olin","No, Pat, it would be significantly more than that, so let\u2019s take \u2013 let\u2019s understand what\u2019s happening; we\u2019ve seen tremendous devaluation starting back in the third quarter, devalued 7%, another 6% in the fourth quarter. And if you look from January 1 of this year through January 28th yesterday\u2019s rates, there was another 4% devaluation. And that\u2019s taking our basket of currencies, our major four currencies which in the euro, the yen, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real, and the mix that we have, we\u2019re down quite considerably.","So what we\u2019re saying here is that if the rates held at yesterday\u2019s, where the exchange rates finished yesterday and they held throughout the year that would take our expected revenue for 2015 and reduce it by 3.25 percentage points. So you take motorcycles segment revenue and take it down by 3.25 points.","Now with that obviously we have hedges on during the year and we talked about that. We typically hedge in a stair step fashion, so we have some hedges on, but those will diminish as the year goes on and we would expect out of that revenue hit, 3.25% of our Motorcycle segment revenue, half of that would fall and be negative impact to gross margin in terms of the dollar, gross margin dollar impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman. Your line is open.","James Hardiman","So obviously you\u2019re not going to give us margin, I\u2019m sorry, segment level guidance and I do appreciate the shipment guidance of four to six. I guess my question is it seems like Road Glide is going to be a pretty sizable benefit to the shipment guide and it sounds like you\u2019re saying Street is going to be up pretty meaningfully as well. I guess the question is, A, can you quantify those benefits to the shipment guide and B, if not, how are you thinking about everything else, right, your non-Road Glide, non-Street guidance, because it seems like for those of us that are [indiscernible] on the numbers that four to six represents flat to maybe even down shipments of everything else, how should we think about that?","Keith Wandell","Thanks, James. You know, we\u2019re not going to break it out by segment. And as we talked about in the preamble, we couldn\u2019t feel better about the company\u2019s or the brands fundamentals from market share to industry to outreach to repeat and the new to brand and so on and so forth. So that will be a big driver.","We\u2019ve got the model year 2015 motorcycles, which we certainly saw in the fourth quarter, the new ones, perform extremely well, including Road Glide. And then as you mentioned, we got the full year Road Glide and Street coming back, along with international expansion. But we also have some headwinds when we look at next year. Those being one as lapping the Rider Academy [ph] sell in, which was about 2200 units in the United States in the first half of last year. So we got to lap that.","And then secondly, as we talked about, in the fourth quarter, we had very significant year-ago enthusiasm for Rushmore and so we got some big gains to lap in the first and second quarters. They tend to taper off each other quarters. And then finally, competitive discounting is coming into play a little bit here. When we take all of that, we couldn\u2019t feel better about our shipment guidance of up 4% to 6%. And we do expect both the new models as well as our core bikes to grow during that to deliver the 4% to 6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson.","Gerrick Johnson","Good morning. Now that you have full distribution this year of the Street 500 and 750, can you give us the new goalpost for what do you think you can ship in the year? Thank you.","Keith Wandell","Thanks, Gerrick. We don\u2019t provide guidance on all of our segments. We did provide it for Street in the first year just to get everybody in the ballpark and we provided it\u2019s 7000 to 10000 units, came in at the very high end of that and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with that. But no, Gerrick, we\u2019re not going to provide another guidance for Street. Suffice it to say is that we would expect Street to be up quite considerably from 2014 levels in 2015, as one we have a full availability in the United States for the selling season as well as our initial four markets last year and we\u2019ll be expanding throughout most of the rest of the world markets through 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] signing in for Joe Spak. Just quick question, what is your industry retail growth view for 2015 and what is HOG US retail view that\u2019s embedded in your 2015 shipment guidance?","Keith Wandell","We don\u2019t provide a forward look at industry retail sales, but what I can tell you is we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the industry growth that we saw in 2014, the increased investment in the industry. So in 2014 we were up 2.5% and that\u2019s with a very slow start to the year. Industry was only up about 1% through the first half due to a very difficult weather conditions, so grew much faster in the back half.","But when we talk about the very strong brand fundamentals, certainly the industry growth is one of them and we would expect to see the industry to grow quite well as we move into 2015, but we do not provide a forecast of it. And certainly some of that thought goes into our shipment guidance of up 4% to 6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder.","Tim Conder","Thank you. John, if you can just give us one shot at - it\u2019s all FX question here, little bit is housekeeping, how much of the fourth quarter 2014 was due to the balance sheet revaluation? And then on a go forward basis with FX, you commented that you of course have your forward 12 months rolling hedges, can you give us any color on those four major currencies, your exposure, what percentage are hedged for your expected 2015 exposure at this point and any levels where you\u2019re hedged?","John Olin","Great, Tim, thank you. On the fourth quarter currency, let\u2019s just take a run through, we don\u2019t break out specifically the revaluation, but I can give you a sense of magnitude. Revenue was hit by $26 million by that year-over-year 9% devaluation. We did pick up some favorability in cost of goods sold of about $3.5 million and that was driven by very favorable gains in terms of the hedges that we did have in place for the quarter, a lot of those being put on several quarters before at very attractive rates.","However, the balance sheet revaluation was very significant. I don\u2019t quantify exactly the number, but it was certainly over $10 million. So that brought the overall impact down and ultimately it hurt operating profits by $23 million, which represented about 1.4 points of gross margin. So ex currency, our gross margin was actually pretty strong and certainly would have been up.","Overall revenue in the quarter was hurt by about 2.5%. As we look forward to the first quarter, Tim, we would expect actually more unfavorablities than we saw in the fourth quarter. So we expect more than $23 million that we had in the fourth quarter and we would expect revenues to be down about 3.25% for the first quarter.","And you asked about the positions that we have, we don\u2019t provide those, because they change on a regular basis. And as the year goes on, obviously the hedge positions change. Suffice it to say that in the dimentionization of our credit risk in 2015, all of that\u2019s incorporated. So as of today, all of our positions are incorporated and we would expect revenue to be down 3.25% and half of that falling through to impact gross margin. So that\u2019s kind of an all-in number for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix.","Felicia Hendrix","Just two quick questions. John, you said earlier in your remarks in your answer to someone else\u2019s question that you\u2019re seeing a little bit of competitive discounting right now, I wanted to see if you could address that? And then just with FX, you have given us good color, thank you very much, at current rates. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out if rates change, is the percentage change, is it linear or is it exponential?","John Olin","Felicia, on discounting, we talked about this the last couple of quarters and we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic shift in discounting. When we look in the fourth quarter, we have seen a stepped up level of discounting. We always see a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter, one it\u2019s the lowest sales month, right, it\u2019s less than 16% of our retail sales, but also there\u2019s a lot of positioning by competition in clearing out inventories. So we saw two-thirds of the folks that have been discounting dramatically increased the discounting on a year over year basis. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep a close eye on.","But you got to remember that our competitors\u2019 models are little bit different. The majority of motorcycles that they sell in a given year are old model years and the fourth quarter was no different. 55% to 75% of the models that the competition sold were over a year old and so just maybe just cleaning out inventories. But that had a big impact on overall market share in the quarter as well. We saw discounts anywhere from $300 a bike to $2000, so just something for us to watch going forward, but we did see an increase in discounting in the fourth quarter.","The second question, Felicia, was the exchange rates. If they move from here, they are not linear, right, because we got revaluation of assets depending on what happens within quarters and we got the fact that we are constantly changing our hedge position. As we talked about, we put on hedges in a steer step fashion over four quarters, we\u2019ll continue to do that. So it is not linear, but certainly with that information should provide a good starting point. But then as the year goes on and things change, that could change a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Hovorka.","Joseph Hovorka","Two questions. Do you anticipate shipping one-to-one wholesale versus retail in 2015? And then secondly, is the FX impact included in the gross margin outlook, the up modestly for 2015?","John Olin","Joe, let me start with the second one to just finish with FX. It is all incorporated in our operating margin guidance of 18% to 19%. When we look at that currency guidance, we would expect it to be a headwind of about half to three-quarters of gross margin point. So obviously ex currency, operating margin would be a fair amount higher. And again, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about what we\u2019ve done in terms of the manufacturing side of the business to deliver those margins and our ability to price and those types of things. So the underlying cost structure and momentum that we\u2019ve got is fairly significant, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. Certainly, currency has thrown us here a pretty big headwind.","So the second question is with regards to, I\u2019m assuming retail inventory at the end of the year, so this year we were up exactly where we thought. And again, I couldn\u2019t say we couldn\u2019t be more prouder of the way that the organization responded to the soft or the poor weather in the first half and the ability of our flexible manufacturing system to adjust very quickly. At the end of the year, we ended with retail inventories exactly where we expected in the United States. They were up, but almost all driven by the Street dealer fail.","As we look forward and feeling very good about where our inventory position is today, we would expect inventory to rise behind just the higher sales, basically holding our days inventory constant year over year. So there would be a modest increase in inventory on a year over year basis as we exit 2015 based on our forward look of retail sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Neil in for Adam Jonas. Just very quickly one last FX housekeeping question. Are you able to tell us your euro-dollar assumption for next year along with any other rate assumptions you\u2019re able to offer? And then finally, can you elaborate on your 2015 outlook in some of the macro troubled markets like LatAm and Canada?","John Olin","I\u2019m sorry, the second part of the question?","Amy Giuffre","He\u2019s just looking for assumptions on certain currencies going forward.","John Olin","With regards to our assumption on currencies, we don\u2019t provide that, an economist can get it right. What we\u2019ve done is we typically hedge on a routine basis to give us more time to react to currencies, but we\u2019re no better at guessing those things as anyone else and we\u2019re certainly not going to provide our assumptions going forward. The dimentionalization that we gave just gives you a point in time, but not a forward look at what we expect currencies to do.","Amy Giuffre","And then your thoughts on macro going forward for LatAm and Canada?","John Olin","Overall, when we look at some of the economies in our international markets, we do have some concerns out there, certainly Brazil has had a tough row to hoe here. We would expect some tough settings still to continue there; Japan and then even Europe. Europe had pretty significant industry growth in motorcycles, but the economy there is something we want to keep a close eye on. And then Canada, given the exchange rates and oil, and Canada has been a little bit tough. So when we look at the world markets, again we couldn\u2019t be more excited about our international opportunity, but are little bit cautious on a few markets out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz.","Jaime Katz","So it looks like gross margin is expected to shake up modestly in the year ahead despite FX headwinds, so can you maybe offer more of the positive commentary on where you think your best opportunity is to capture that gross margin expansion is? And then just any additional commentary that you might have on what resonated well in international markets which performed very well in the recent quarter outside of that Street model?","John Olin"," Great. Opportunities on operating margin is very simply \u2013 we priced our model year 2015 motorcycles and that\u2019s going to continue to drive margin opportunity both in dollars as well as percent. The other is there\u2019s incremental margin coming from increased sales, that 4% to 6% shipment increase. And Jamie, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019ve had our core margin of about 36%, but for each incremental bike that we put through the system here, it\u2019s an incremental margin of about 47%. So that will drive a lot of benefit in terms of overall gross margin percent as well.","And then finally, the business model that we\u2019ve put together and the flexible manufacturing that we\u2019ve got working and the focus that the plans have on continuous improvement, the systems that we\u2019ve put in are all driving fantastic productivity out of the plants and we would expect that to continue into 2015. Again, I can\u2019t say enough about how strong that\u2019s been.","The second question that you asked is with regards to our international growth, we\u2019ve talked a lot about international, we\u2019ve invested, we\u2019ve expanded the dealer network and we expect that to continue in 2015. But aside from Street and we\u2019ve talked about Street, three out of four motorcycles in India are Street, in Southern Europe it sold very well, it\u2019s bringing a lot of new people into the brand and we\u2019ll clearly expand that in the first quarter here to many more markets around the world. But we can\u2019t overlook how well our other products are doing internationally. And the core products are all up this year and expected to be up next year, but in particular Project Rushmore motorcycles are selling extremely well internationally.","For example, in Europe, we\u2019re well over 20% growth in our Touring product and that\u2019s happening in Asia, in Latin America as well, so we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the overall portfolio internationally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Badishkanian.","Gregory Badishkanian","Just on the international front, trends were really solid there. With the headwind of currency and maybe some macro issues, how do you see your pricing changing in the first half at retail, Harley motorcycle pricing at retail and then how do you think that will maybe compare versus some of your competition?","Keith Wandell","Our overall approach to managing currencies has been to sell our products in local currencies, right. And we keep local prices stable that way and then we manage overall currencies kind of back here as a basket of currencies, and then manage that through the P&L. And we believe keeping prices stable at the market level is the best way to build and manage a premium brand and it\u2019s worked very well for us. What we\u2019re seeing here is certainly unprecedented, one to see the magnitude of change and to see everything moving in the same direction, obviously we\u2019ve given some dimentionalization on the impact on our earnings. So we\u2019re certainly concerned and we\u2019ll look at all options to deal with it. But let me tell you, Greg, is that we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for this brand in the long term and we\u2019re going to work through it. But whatever we do decide to do, it will be in the best interest of the brand going forward.","Operator"," Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor.","David MacGregor","Just to build on the international line of questioning, you\u2019ve talked in the past about trying to get 100 to 150 dealers, you\u2019re kind of approaching the high end of that range now, you\u2019re talking a lot about growing international side of the business, can you sort of lay out for us what the plans are in terms of dealer development over the next couple of years?","Keith Wandell","One, we look to continue to expand the dealer network and you can expect that the dealers that will open up will be in line with what you saw in 2014. But more importantly is making sure that we\u2019re increasing throughput through those dealers and making sure that all our products are there and ready to go when we do open those dealers. And again, we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity and we feel that there\u2019s a lot more to gain in distribution over the next several years.","Operator","Your final question for today comes from the line of Patrick Archambault.","Unidentified Analyst","It\u2019s actually Dave [indiscernible] on for Pat and glad to make on to the wire here. Just a question circling back to the Q4 shipment, you ended up towards the lower end of your guidance range, can you kind of mention what really drove it into that lower range, was it the competitive pricing, was it a stronger use bike marketers or something else maybe we\u2019re not thinking about?","Keith Wandell","No, David, our desire and our mandate is aggressively manage supply in line with demand. We knew we\u2019re going to have a tough retail sales quarter in the fourth quarter, given the fact that the non-Road Glide Touring bikes were up 40% on a year-over-year basis. And what we wanted to do is manage to an inventory level that\u2019s appropriate to continue to maintain the premium nature of our brand and we did exactly that. And we ended up exactly where we expected, exactly where we planned a year ago for inventories to end up, which were up driven only by Street. So we shipped in to hit those inventory levels.","Amy Giuffre","All right, thank you, John, and thank you everyone for calling in and thanks for your time this morning.

You can access the slides supporting this call on harley-davidson.com. Click About Us at the top right, select Investors from the drop-down and click the Earnings Materials Box in the center of the page.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin. Matt, let's get started.","Matthew Levatich","Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to dedicate the bulk of my remarks to how we're approaching 2018 and beyond, but to do so, I'll begin with the context of our challenges in the U.S. industry and in certain international markets that continue to require the best in us as we take decisive action to position our business for performance and strength for the long-term.","Our efforts throughout 2017 were geared toward two key imperatives: first, achieving the right balance of new motorcycle quantity and mix at retail; and second, positioning the company's cost structure to better compete in this new reality.","In addition, while we directed substantial energy toward addressing the current market conditions, we stayed grounded in our strategy and made good progress on our long-term objective to build riders globally.","During the first year of our 10-year journey, we established a foundation and made good initial progress on growing ridership. In the U.S., our disciplined supply management approach supported lean and model year mix appropriate year-end retail inventory. We also saw an improvement in used bike prices, a cornerstone of value for our riders and our dealers, who are such a key part of our business.","More importantly, with unwavering brand stewardship as our guide, we respected the premium Harley-Davidson has earned over 115 years, with pivotal moves like the launch of our all-new highly acclaimed Softail motorcycles, improved rider training conversion and expanded international reach. We continue to enhance the Harley-Davidson value proposition and not damage it by implementing shortsighted tactics.","Our second imperative in 2017 was bringing increased focus to our resource allocation and cost structure. Our efforts resulted in a $41 million reduction in SG&A and positioned us to better compete in today's environment.","We introduced our objectives and strategies to build riders last January and made excellent progress during the first year of execution. A year ago, we began our critical mindset and cultural shift at the company from we build motorcycles to we build riders.","We closed 2017 with over 32,000 more Harley-Davidson riders in the United States compared to 1 year ago. These riders were inspired because of efforts, including a more inclusive and welcoming brand promise, All for Freedom, Freedom for All, informed by deep insights about what is the common thread of our brand for both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s riders, improved riding academy conversion, not simply training riders but creating riders.","Sales conversions were up, and we gained insights on how to continue to further improve this important capability, increased access to riding through our partnership with EagleRider that enables customers to more readily experience the thrill of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and importantly, our most exciting and best-performing products ever.","In 2017, we leveraged our capabilities and kept our eyes firmly on how to best bring together all our strengths to inspire and nurture people along their journey to riding. We're also delighted to see others in the industry join the march to build ridership in the United States.","We'll continue to lead the effort and encourage other manufacturers, the motorcycle media and dealers everywhere to unite and leverage our collective power to inspire future riders to experience the exhilaration and freedom of motorcycles.","2017 was challenging in many ways, but it was also rewarding. I'm pleased with how our actions reflected the reality of the current environment and positioned us well to face it. We continue to lead with strong product and a disciplined approach in all of our operations and actions. The net of all our actions drove another year of strong cash generation and cash returns to our shareholders.","With all this in mind, we have much more to do. Looking forward to 2018, we expect international retail growth. However, we don't expect a reprieve from the challenges in the U.S. motorcycle industry. Our global retail expectations and our disciplined supply management strategy are reflected in our guidance for reduced year-over-year shipments.","As we navigate ongoing headwinds in 2018, we will keep our attention on the strategic imperative to grow ridership. We'll remain steadfast to our disciplined supply management and step up the intensity of our investment focus, resource allocation and cost management to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash returns for our shareholders.","To further improve our cost structure and maintain our world-class manufacturing operations, we're commencing a significant multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative anchored by the consolidation of our final assembly plant in Kansas City into our plant in York, Pennsylvania.","This decision was made after very careful consideration of our manufacturing footprint and the appropriate capacity, given the current business environment. As we consolidate assembly operations, we expect approximately 800 jobs will be eliminated with the closure of Kansas City operations and that approximately 450 jobs will be added in York as we shift capacity there by 2019.","This decision was extremely difficult but necessary under the circumstances. Our Kansas City assembly operations and our employees there have an impressive tradition of safety, quality, collaboration and manufacturing leadership.","I have profound respect for the women and men in that facility, and I thank them and the Kansas City community for their years of support and contribution to serving Harley-Davidson, our dealers and, most importantly, our riders.","Another key element of the manufacturing optimization will be the closure of our wheel operations in Adelaide, Australia. For many years, New Castalloy has produced our high finish, contrast and mirror chrome wheels and hubs, but as style preferences shift toward core competencies of other Harley-Davidson wheel suppliers, the utilization of that facility continues to fall.","This is another tough decision affecting approximately 100 talented and dedicated Harley-Davidson employees, and I want to thank them as well. Our focus moving forward in 2018 and beyond is to be more aggressive and innovative, leveraging our learnings and capabilities to sharpen our focus and scale our efforts to compete more effectively in every market we're in as we build Harley-Davidson riders.","On the momentum created from our years of customer outreach success in the U.S., we made significant investments to establish a knowledge base of the ownership patterns of every rider in the United States how they entered and participated in this work over time.","This is not the typical product view of the industry but a unique rider-by-rider view of the sport since 2000. Our recently acquired data assets allow us to draw deeper insights on participation themes, whether individual or generational.","We know we must not only inspire and create new riders but also keep riders engaged in the sport and riding longer. Our ridership efforts both building new riders and keeping riders engaged will only intensify as we continue to apply our learnings and dial in our resources on proven methods.","Outside the U.S., we'll intensify our efforts to increase the reach and impact of Harley-Davidson. We'll take advantage of the tailwinds from our successful awareness and test ride campaigns and leverage the positive reviews in the media of our new touring and Softail motorcycles.","In addition, more customers will gain access to our products as we continue to expand our dealer network outside the U.S. Access and product inspiration are key in the vast and competitive international markets and our access to certain emerging markets is about to see a step change later this year when we begin operations at our new facility in Thailand.","Like our facilities in Brazil and India, this plant will support more competitive retail pricing by eliminating much of the tax and tariff burden that fully assembled imports carry in some of these markets. Our plant will leverage existing suppliers and our U.S. plants for component supply.","We expect more competitive pricing will drive profitable share and increased demand, volume growth that would not materialize had the motorcycles been shipped from the U.S. and subject to import duties of up to 60%. The clear majority of our operations have been and will continue to be, U.S.-based and our cash comes back here too. The tax reform legislation is intended to benefit companies like Harley-Davidson that are committed to U.S. operations.","The positive impact of tax reform on our cash flow will provide additional investment capital to drive our business, and we will continue to apply our discipline to investment decisions and capital allocation principles to drive value for the business and return excess cash to our shareholders.","In 2018, a portion of the benefit from the new tax legislation will support our objective to invest in high-impact product, to inspire ridership by continuing to redefine our product in traditional spaces and expand into new spaces to reach new people.","One key opportunity is the rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape. The EV market is in its infancy today and we believe it will drive excitement into our sport globally in both traditional and nontraditional spaces.","You've heard us talk about Project LiveWire. LiveWire is an exhilarating, no excuses, electric Harley-Davidson. Over 12,000 riders told us so through the demo rides we provided around the world and it's an active project we're preparing to bring to market within 18 months.","This morning, we announced we'll invest more aggressively in our effort to lead in the application of electric technology in premium motorcycles to inspire ridership among new audiences.","The more we grow our experience and capability with EV, the more excited we become about the role it will play in growing business, about the additional and region impact electric Harley-Davidson motorcycles will bring as an element of our product portfolio.","We expect our increased commitment and investment in EV to help accelerate the development of this market and assure we are the world leader in the electrification motorcycles, along with our continued leadership in premium, classic, custom and touring motorcycles.","Our bottom-line will be aggressive in speaking and prioritizing opportunities that drive growth, profitability and cash flow, opportunities that improve the company's growth trajectory and leverage our significant capabilities, assets, dealers and employee -- employees to drive value for all and deliver superior returns to our shareholders.","2018 is our 115th year in business, and we're very proud of that because it takes strength, courage and creativity to persevere for that long no matter what the industry. Our history is rich with episodes of triumph and episodes that challenged prevailing thinking and tested fortitude and resolve.","Our focus right here, right now is on our future, and on bringing forward all the substantial strengths of this company to shape that future no matter what our present challenge.","So with that in mind, John will walk you through the financial details. Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks Matt.","It's clear the U.S. 601+ cc industry continued to face significant challenges in the fourth quarter. In addition, international retail sales finished below our expectations. Considering ongoing challenges, we remain focused on reducing U.S. retail inventory, reducing costs and investing our strategy to drive value for our riders, dealers and shareholders.","The summary of our Q4 result is on Slide 10. Revenue was up behind increased shipments compared to last year's fourth quarter. Operating income from both motorcycles and financial services was also up.","Net income and earnings per share were both down from last year's fourth quarter, adversely impacted by a write-down of net deferred tax assets. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term despite significant near-term headwinds.","On Slide 11, Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 9.6% versus prior year. In the United States, retail sales were significantly lower, driven by ongoing industry weakness, soft market share behind lapping last year's share gains and limited availability.","While international retail sales were below our expectations, we continue to believe that our strong brand, products and expanded distribution will drive sustained growth in international markets over time. We remain committed to our long-term international growth strategy.","We recognize this was another difficult quarter. However, we are encouraged by the positive response to our new Softail motorcycles, our U.S. dealers' inventory position, the expansion of our international dealer network and certainly by the progress we are making to build riders globally.","Let's take a closer look at the U.S. On Slide 12, U.S. retail sales were down 11.1% in Q4. The industry was down 6.5% in the fourth quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of industry weakness. We believe the new motorcycle industry continued to be adversely impacted by soft used bike prices, but prices improved in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Bike pricing is a headwind to new bike sales. Year-to-date sales of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up through November and continued to perform significantly better than new retail sales in the United States.","Year-to-date, total registrations of new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles combined were down slightly through November. However, our 2017 share of combined registered new and used motorcycles increased for the ninth consecutive year.","Key to our focus of driving premium value for our riders, dealers and the brand are strong used bike prices. In Q4, we continued to see positive momentum in used motorcycle pricing. Used Harley-Davidson bike wholesale prices at auction remain above year-ago levels, and pricing services such as NADA and Black Book continue to publish higher retail values year-over-year for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.","Finally, for the second consecutive quarter, dealership data indicates that Harley-Davidson prices in the broader used bike market were up in aggregate, particularly in our dealer network.","Moving on to new motorcycle market share. Harley-Davidson share in the quarter was down 2.6 percentage points but remained a very healthy 50.8%. We believe our market share was adversely impacted by lapping last year's strong share gain of 2.0 percentage points and by limited availability. On the positive side, our share of large Cruisers was up significantly, driven by the new Softail motorcycles.","U.S. retail motorcycle inventory was down nearly 10% to 25% throughout most of the quarter. At the end of the quarter, retail inventory was down approximately 3,000 motorcycles compared to prior year. We believe our discipline to reduce the supply and improve model year mix in the U.S. delivered the intended results, and we were well positioned as we entered 2018. We continue to work hard to protect and reinforce the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand.","On Slide 13, international retail sales in Q4 were down 7.7%. Overall, it was a tough quarter in most of our international markets. However, there are positive developments \u2013 there were positive developments during the quarter.","First, the new Softail motorcycles are being very well received by our customers in Europe, Asia and Latin America.","In Q4, we experienced strong sell-through rates with limited availability throughout the quarter. We believe the strong customer response to our Softails, coupled with the fact that international retail sales generally skew to a heavier mix of Softails than in the United States, is a good early indicator of the potential impact of the new models.","Next, in line with our strategy to increase brand access internationally, we continue to expand our international dealer network. During the quarter, 22 new dealers were added for a full year total of 57. We remain confident in our international growth prospects and expect to return to retail sales growth in 2018.","On Slide 14, wholesale motorcycle shipments were up 11.3% in the quarter and within our shipment guidance range. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, Cruisers as a percent of total shipments were up behind the launch of the new Softail motorcycles.","On Slide 15, revenue, the motorcycle segment was up in the fourth quarter behind higher year-over-year motorcycle shipments. Q4 average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $835 over last year's fourth quarter. The increase was due to higher pricing and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by unfavorable mix.","On Slide 16, gross margin was up in Q4 behind increased shipments, higher pricing and favorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable mix and rising raw material costs.","On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q4 was 3.6%, up 2.6 percentage points compared to last year. Operating margin percent benefited from slightly higher gross margin percent and lower SG&A spending as a percent of revenue.","SG&A was up $7.9 million to prior year, as our aggressive cost-management efforts were offset by a charge of $29.4 million for a voluntary product recall. This voluntary recall addresses an investigation opened by NHTSA in 2016 and involved certain 2008 to 2011 touring and VRSC motorcycles equipped with anti-lock braking systems.","Harley-Davidson has a two-year brake fluid replacement interval for ABS-equipped motorcycles, and some customers failed to follow that replacement interval for extended periods. We are committed to providing customers with the quality experience they expect from Harley-Davidson and will be offering a free brake fluid flush and replacement to owners of recalled motorcycles. Our profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus. It is our aim to further leverage our established capabilities, to continue to drive profit, cash flow and strong ROIC into the future.","HDFS's Q4 operating income, shown on Slide 18, increased 5.9% compared to last year. Operating income was positively impacted by a lower provision for retail loan losses of $7.1 million, driven by a smaller increase in the allowance as compared to Q4 2016. The impact of 2017 hurricanes was not as significant as we anticipated. HDFS's operational results are on Slide 19.","Originations were down 0.3%, but market share was up 0.3 percentage points during the quarter compared to last year. At the end of the quarter, there was $349.3 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $887 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.","On Slide 20, the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on balance sheet at the end of December was 4.21% or four basis points lower than Q4 2016. This is the first quarter in 11 quarters that our 30-day delinquency was down on a year-over-year basis.","The annual retail credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.90% or only 7 basis points higher than 2016. While credit losses were up for the full year, we are pleased that the rate of increase has tempered quite significantly from last year. HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company.","The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 21. Our effective tax rate was 91.2% in the fourth quarter and 39.6% for the full year 2017, both considerably higher than our expectations, largely due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act.","Two important components of this legislation are, first, the lowering of the federal corporate income tax rate resulted in the write-down of net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter. Our overall net deferred tax assets were previously valued using a federal tax rate of 35%. Lowering the valuation to a rate of 21% and other reform-related adjustments has resulted in a write-down of $53.1 million. It is important to note that this was a non-cash adjustment to our balance sheet.","Second, the new legislation also requires many companies to pay tax on unremitted foreign earnings at rates of either 8% or 15.5%. Given our predominantly U.S. based manufacturing operations we do not expect to be adversely impacted by this provision. However, we will continue to evaluate this complex component of the legislation and expect to refine our assessment as additional information becomes available.","And finally, regarding liquidity, the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. Our full year financial results are summarized on Slide 22.","We believe the charts on Slide 23 demonstrate that we are in a class of our own when it comes to generating cash. The top left chart illustrates our ability to generate operating cash flow even in very tough business conditions, as was the case in 2017.","Last year, net income was down nearly 25%, but operating cash was down only 14.4%. The remaining charts benchmark our cash flow versus previous peer groups. In each case, Harley-Davidson is the clear leader in our ability to generate cash.","Slide 24 illustrates our strong history of returning cash to our shareholders. Again, we are a leader in this area across multiple industries. In 2017, we paid dividends of $1.46 per share and repurchased 8.7 million shares for $456.1 million.","One of the five objectives guiding our business strategies and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital, as measured by motor company ROIC and the top quartile of the S&P 500 and by best-in-class ROE at HDFS. Harley-Davidson is a leader in ROIC at HDMC and ROE at HDFS.","Driving superior value for our shareholders is our top priority. We will continue to look for opportunities to grow value, first and foremost, by disciplined investments to maximize the performance and long-term potential of the company and the brand.","We have a robust process for our investment decisions and our discipline to it. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases.","On Slide 25, we have provided a summary of our multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative. We expect this optimization to result in a reduction in operating income of $170 million to $200 million through 2019 of which roughly 30% will be noncash write-downs of existing assets. We also plan to invest approximately $75 million of capital. We expect annual ongoing cash savings to be between $65 million to $75 million after 2020.","These actions will eliminate some manufacturing capacity. However, we will still have appropriate headroom for future motorcycle unit growth. We believe these investments have very attractive returns. When completed, we expect this initiative will simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus on our operational investments and improve gross margin by approximately 1.25 percentage points.","A summary of our expectations for 2018 is on Slide 26. We expect to ship between 231,000 and 236,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 2% to 4%. Our assumptions include U.S. dealer retail sales to be down. Our assumptions include U.S. retail dealer \u2013 retail sales to be down, partially offset by growth in international retail sales. We expect year-end U.S. retail inventory to be flat to 2017 and flat to up in international markets as we continue to add dealers.","During 2018, we expect retail sales to be positively impacted by: increased focus and investment on growing global ridership, new product momentum with our 2018 motorcycles and the addition of new high-impact models yet to be introduced, a rebound in emerging market retail sales performance and expansion of the international dealer network.","However, we expect these positive to be more than offset by strong headwinds, including a very weak U.S. new industry \u2013 new motorcycle industry, driven by flat to declining total demand, which we are focusing on with our ridership efforts and soft but improving Harley-Davidson used bike prices. We also expect pressure from continued new product introductions throughout the world markets, in particular, low-priced small displacement motorcycles.","Operating margin as a percent of revenue for the motorcycle segment is expected to be approximately 9.5% to 10.5% for the full year 2018. This reduction of roughly two percentage points to three percentage points compared to 2017 is primarily driven by manufacturing optimization cost of $120 million to $140 million.","Also, our operating margin will be reduced by approximately 0.2 percentage points due a new accounting pronouncement related to pension accounting, which requires us to move approximately $10 million of operating income to non-operating income. This adjustment will be made to both 2017 and 2018 actual results when we report first quarter earnings in April.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue is expected to benefit from pricing of our model year 2018 and 2019 motorcycles, a more favorable foreign currency exchange environment than last year and positive mix. We expect these positives to be more than offset by rising steel and aluminum costs and increased manufacturing expense.","We expect manufacturing expense will be higher in part by increased depreciation from recent investments in our new Softail motorcycles. However, we expect the larger driver of increased manufacturing costs will be due to temporary inefficiencies of $20 million to $25 million related to the consolidation of our two U.S. final assembly plants and the closure of our Australian real operations.","In addition to temporary inefficiencies in gross margin, we expect to incur approximately $100 million to $115 million of restructuring costs to execute our manufacturing optimization initiative during the year. Of that total, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $57 million in the first quarter, largely consisting of severance charges and accelerated depreciation.","We expect SG&A on an absolute basis to be higher in 2018 versus 2017 as we continue to invest in our long-term strategies, but flat as a percent of revenue. We expect SG&A to be up behind increased investment in marketing and product development as we work to grow ridership globally.","As Matt stated, we will increase our investment in electric motorcycle technology and products and infrastructure in an effort to be a world leader in electric motorcycle market. We expect to spend an incremental $25 million to $50 million per year over the next several years.","In the first quarter, we expect shipments to be approximately 60,000 to 65,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 8% to 15%, as we continue our disciplined supply strategy. While we expect U.S. retail inventories will be tighter than Q1 of 2017, we believe the composition of previous and current model year motorcycles will be considerably improved from last year.","We expect motorcycle segment operating income as a percent of revenue in Q1 to be down approximately five percentage points behind the $57 million restructuring charge, loss absorption from lower production and higher SG&A as we increase marketing and product development investments.","For HDFS, we expect operating income to be down, driven by lower net interest income, partially offset by a favorable provision for credit losses. Capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to be $250 million to $270 million, which includes approximately $50 million to support our manufacturing optimization initiative.","Finally, we expect our full year effective tax rate will be approximately 23.5% to 25%, down approximately 10 percentage points from the rate we would have expected before tax reform. This range could change as we continue to analyze the tax act.","To wrap up, we're committed to addressing the ongoing weakness in our business by being disciplined in our management of supply, our brand premium and our cash returns amplifying our cost management efforts and relentlessly focusing on our long-term objectives. As we build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally, we will prudently focus on our investments, deliver on strong returns to our investors and sustain the company for the long-term. Thank you.","Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","John, just a little bit more clarification on the international retail weakness. It appeared significantly weaker than expected, except for Canada. Color on that. And then just reiterate also your keys of driving your flat U.S. retail expectations for 2018? Thank you.","John Olin","I'm sorry, the second part of that question?","Amy Giuffre","Why flat retail U.S\u2026","Tim Conder","Yes, just the keys driving your flat U.S. retail expectations for '18?","John Olin","International retail sales were down 7.7% in the fourth quarter. They were down throughout the year 3.9%. We've looked at all of our international businesses. We see nothing in common with the various markets. The brand is fundamentally strong. We don't see any issues. We hear time to time and are asked, is kind of the U.S.A. brand affecting our brand. We don't have any data to that effect.","Our brand stands for freedom and independence and personal freedom, and we think the brand is fundamentally sound. What we have internationally is a confluence of things that have come together in 2017.","The first half was largely characterized by soft emerging market sales, driven by China and India. In the third quarter, we started to see emerging markets improve, and at that time, we saw a couple other markets go a little bit tilt on us. In particular, in Australia, the industry was down quite significantly. The industry was down in the fourth quarter in Australia as well.","Our volumes were down about 23%. But in Australia, we gained market share. So overall, we're very - feel very good about the international business as we move into next year, but it was a tough year in 2017.","Matthew Levatich","Tim, you asked why flat retail sales in the United States? I believe that you're referring to in 2018, we do not expect retail sales to be flat in 2018. We expect retail sales to be down next year, and that's driven by continued soft U.S. industry.","Amy Giuffre","I believe Tim asked about inventory, so if you want to comment on inventory.","John Olin","With regards to the inventory, on a full year basis, we would expect to end 2018 in the same position that we are today. We feel very good about where inventories are to kind of launch as a preset to the selling season.","Within the year of 2018, we would expect inventories to be down in the first half as we continue to keep pressure on the overall system and keep inventories lower. Again, the mix of inventory this year is significantly better than it was last year, where we had a substantial amount of carryover product that we were working through and holding back new product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Matt, I wanted to ask about Kansas City and York. Without realignment, how would you frame the total unit capacity today versus what you will have following the realignment? Thanks.","Matthew Levatich","Well, I don't have a specific figure for you, Craig, but we feel very good about the total footprint over time. We feel that we're in good shape for capacity really for the next decade as far as what we project. And we're investing in York, not just closing Kansas City. We're investing to expand the capacity of York in line with that.","So it isn't just one minus one equals - two minus one equals one. It's bigger than that, and so we feel pretty good about the capacity for the next decade.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","James Hardiman","I wanted to circle back inventory question. So looks like domestic inventories were down about 3,000 units. At some point, you had said you wanted to bring those down double-digits this year. Obviously, we don't know the exact sort of base number there, but it doesn't seem like that's quite double-digits.","And I know you pointed to bigger than that over the course of the quarter. I don't know if I should read into that inventories picked up at the very end of the quarter. But I guess, more broadly, retail's down, it seems like significantly more than inventories over the past few years. So I guess, if there's any way that we can think about inventory turns at retail. It seems like even though inventories have come down, retail has maybe come down more. I guess, what gives you confidence that this is the right level of inventory as we exit 2017?","John Olin","We talked about bringing inventories down in the second quarter and that'd be down double-digit, and we were down very close to double-digit but not quite there, and that was a little bit softer fourth quarter retail sales in the U.S. than we had anticipated. Throughout the quarter, inventories were very tight anywhere from down near the 10% double-digit to down 25%.","James, you're right with regards to overall retail sales and inventory. I would say probably the worst time to look at inventory is at year-end, but it is a thing that everyone looks at because it's the end of the year. More importantly, inventory levels are at carryover and when we get into the selling season.","And having said that is we need a certain level of inventory so that we can get in supply, the selling season. We're a very seasonal business, and we need a launching spot, even though we've got a lot of flexible manufacturing and we surge our production, we need to have a level of inventory at about this time of the year so that we can gear up and supply the selling season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Woolf from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Seth Woolf","I guess, wanted to dig into the international business. I know it's been -- you talked about how it's been challenging. But I think if we look at the last two years, we've added almost 100 locations, and shipments are the same. So what gives you confidence that we can, in fact, see the growth that we've been talking about for a while?","And then secondly, you talk about used prices getting better. Have you considered that it could be a function of dealers buying more aggressively as they plan to allocate more of their showroom to used bikes going forward?","John Olin","With regards to the international business, you're absolutely right. We've added in this year, largely toward the end of this year, so we didn't get the full benefit, about 6% more dealerships in our international business, and we believe those additions will serve us well. We'll continue to add dealerships in 2018. We've not seen the full benefit of those dealerships.","Those incremental dealerships are selling incremental product. But the headwinds internationally have been pretty strong this year. Again, we don't believe there's anything fundamentally wrong with the business. And as we look forward, what will drive the business is partly that distribution gains.","Secondly is product. When we look at our Softail product, very well received, and it skews to a heavier mix internationally than it does in the United States. So we believe that new Softails will benefit our international business more. Again, we're seeing the emerging markets turn, and we're very excited about that. And overall, we'll be spending more money in marketing to drive that business forward. So again, we expect retail sales growth to return in our international markets.","Next question was with regards to used prices and the allocation of floor space. Over the last -- actually, over the last 12 quarters, used bike inventory in our dealerships have been down, and three quarters they've been up. One of those quarters has been up, has been the fourth quarter of this year.","But overall, we're very positive on and sell our dealer selling used motorcycles. We want our dealers to sell it in balance, the ratio of new to used to be balanced. But a lot of people enter the brand on our used motorcycles. As dealers go out and pick up used motorcycles, it does put upward pressure on used bike pricing, which is very important to the brand as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel from Bernstein. Your line is open.","David Beckel","I was wondering, sort of a high level, have the declines you've experienced since your Investor Day last February in any way caused you to rethink or recalibrate your 10-year plan or otherwise given you a stronger sense of urgency?","Matthew Levatich","I would say no to the first question and yes to the second question. We actually feel even more strongly about our objectives and their appropriateness, certainly, the importance of growing ridership, delivering high ROIC and strong cash flow, how we use high-impact product to do that and kind of tying to the last question about used bike prices [Audio Gap].","So we feel stronger than ever about appropriateness of those objectives, and we feel, importantly, that we have to dial up our intensity and get sharper in our focus. And I think I referenced the knowledge base of rider patterns in the United States.","It's providing us a tremendous amount of insight about how to focus our efforts, and we're frontloading a lot of effort this spring to really test some assumptions and dial up our efforts to move the needle on ridership and grow the total business in the United States. So, yes, the strategy is strong, and yes, our intensity is increasing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","You mentioned a couple of times, limited availability impacting retail and market share. So can you quantify the limited availability and how that did impact both of those metrics? And basically, what your \u2013 what drove that? Or actually, what was the quantitative amount of shipments you cut back on? Thanks.","Matthew Levatich","We saw our weakest retail sales in that quarter \u2013 in that month as well. As inventories improved, we saw retail sales improve throughout the quarter, but we ended up nearly down 10% as we exited the overall quarter. So it's hard to quantify exactly how many people were not able to buy and that will buy in the spring or in the first quarter of this year.","Again, when we have limited availability, we do not think that anyone is coming into our showrooms and then going over to Honda or Suzuki and buying another motorcycle. Our dealers are very good at getting them on the right color and model that they need and want.","Overall, share loss in the quarter, we expected shares to be down, and that was a bigger function of the fact that a year ago, we came out with the new Milwaukee-Eight engine on touring, which represents over 50% of our U.S. sales and as well as the 2016 models were being discounted by the dealer network, because there was an oversupply. And so overall, market share was 2 points up a year ago and we had to lap that, and that's the biggest driver of share being down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak","Happy to see the restructuring. I guess, I'm wondering if you think there is some other efficiencies in the business. Like, have you benchmarked engineering versus some other competitors or industries? And then, Matt, on the 10-year plan, glad to hear there's sort of this greater sense of urgency. But with sort of all these changes, I was wondering if you could help us with some more near-term metrics to sort of help us better gauge whether you're on track for that plan. Thanks.","John Olin","I\u2019ll do - it's John, I think - except now I can't remember the first question.","Amy Giuffre","Benchmark against engineers.","Matthew Levatich","Yes. Actually - thanks, Joe. We put this under the line of manufacturing optimization because those are the big movers, but it's actually a pretty comprehensive cost view of the core components of our business. So those are the design and supply management and many different facets of the business, and we're going to continue to look for opportunities to be more focused with our resources, and we've alluded to that both in my comments and John's comments. So look for that going forward.","As it relates to how we're doing, right? And so clearly, the top line measures of sales and market share and stuff, we'll continue to talk about that. You're going to hear us talk more and more about how we're doing with riders. Very pleased that in 2017, we grew the net number of total Harley-Davidson riders in the United States by 32,000. That's important.","We're finding from the rider migration database that there's quite a lot more flow, if you will, within the U.S. markets than we expected. We had quite a large number of new to the sport people joining on Harley in 2017 more than we thought would be naturally coming in and through our efforts. And actually, we had quite a few more exit than we expected, too.","So the flux within the industry is higher than we thought. That's important insights as we figure out how to dial in our efforts, and we're going to be talking more about that as we go forward because clearly, the total demand for Harley-Davidson, the total number of active participating motorcyclists in the United States is a key measure for the strength of this and the vitality of this industry in the United States is so important to our overall business.","So we'll talk more about those things as we roll forward, but we're excited to be able to share just the top line information today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache","Just following up on that. Maybe can you tell us what you think the number of new riders you need to create is in order to achieve flat retail sales because I presume that 32,000 is not enough because you put 148,000 into the park. And also, just secondly, can you just clarify what - maybe just repeat what you said about the commodity impact and the pension impact and whether there's some CapEx savings that you're targeting from this restructuring?","Matthew Levatich","Thanks, Rod. It's Matt. I'll do part one, and John will do part two. We're actually \u2013 the other side of that equation is very interesting as well, and we don't have a lot of specific details of the composition. But while we added 32,000 riders to the Harley-Davidson University in the United States, the net increase in the number of our registered motorcycles was only about 23,000. So, on a base of 3.4 million motorcycles in the market, some exited - some motorcycles exited the market in 2017 as well. So the net increase was 23,000 bikes against a net increase of riders of 32,000.","So when you look at that very high level motorcycle rider ecosystem, that's what we're really focusing in on. And how that will unfold over time based on generational trends and so forth is what we're modeling to drive the numbers that you referenced of how aggressive we need to be in growing the sport to stay ahead of our riders than motorcycles.","John Olin","Rod, you'd asked about, I believe, the gross margin and as we look forward, you'd mentioned commodity costs and whatnot. Overall gross margin, we expect to be down on a year-over-year basis, largely driven by higher manufacturing expense. That manufacturing expense will be driven by the temporary inefficiencies to consolidate Casey into the York facility.","And then we expect about $15 million to $20 million of debt expense. Aside from that, and taking out the manufacturing optimization, we expect our margins \u2013 both gross margin, SG&A as a percent of revenue and operating margin to be largely flat year-over-year on lower volumes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","A lot of questions have been asked and answered, but I guess, I'm wondering on the marketing. I know you guys have invested a lot in marketing over the last few years, and that's been a key driver. And I'm wondering how you're assessing the ROI on that marketing spend and the effectiveness and whether kind of a shift is needed and how you're trying to drive those new riders or those new motorcycle sales?","Matthew Levatich","I would say that there's a level of intensity to that very subject that exists day-to-day in the organization. So you hear the terms around precision marketing, how are we leveraging our customer knowledge center, which is the hand razors that we collect every year, for example, that express interest in the sport or in the band, how are we qualifying those leads and making sure that the dealers get high-quality leads and do high-quality follow-ups.","So there's a lot of effort in that space in how we deploy our marketing investment to drive the outcomes that we need, whether those are sales outcomes or ridership growth outcomes. The team is very tight on it. We're frontloading a lot of the investment. A lot of the investment this year is also being directed towards some very controlled experiments, see how we can do things like change the conversion rate more quickly in Riding Academy, how can we turn qualified leads into real riders quickly and effectively.","So we're going to be right out of the gate with some very strong regional focused accelerants that drive our learning and drive our performance. So the marketing mix is being assessed constantly on that basis according to our strategy, and I think the team is energized actually by the opportunity to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","I just also wanted you to know that there's just been some technical difficulties throughout the call, Matt. You've been popping in and out, and we didn't hear the whole first answer to Gerrick's question, but just so you know.","To start, just wondering in your down 2% to 4% guidance, how should we think about U.S. \u2013 the mix U.S. shipments and international shipments, will they be both down? But just stepping back bigger picture, in August, you guys announced what, in my view, was one of the most exciting new model launches in the history of the company. Retail registrations in the fourth quarter were negative globally. You've talked about that. You first quarter unit shipment guidance is down in the mid-teens at the midpoint, and the full year is down.","We all know that the industry as a whole is challenged, and we're trying to keep inventory levels low. And you've kind of - we understand that well. But what I'm really trying to understand is if retail registrations were negative following such an incredible new product launch and your unit shipments for these bikes are down arguably for the remainder of the 2018 model year cycle, then where is the gap coming from? It seems like there might be a gap between what you're making and what the consumer wants. Maybe it's product. Maybe it's price. But thinking about that, how can we expect to see accelerated growth if it didn't come in this fantastic new model year?","Matthew Levatich","Felicia, the first question with regards to shipments being down 2% to 4%, as we look into 2018, we expect U.S. retail sales to be down. And consequently \u2013 and with inventories flat on a year-over-year basis, consequently, shipments will be down in the United States. Internationally, we expect retail sales to grow, and we expect inventories to be flat to rising, so we would be shipping an increase in the international markets.","Secondly, with regards to the new model launch in Softail, certainly, we would love to see positive retail sales growth overall. What we are seeing from Softail is fantastic results. Up -- market share of the large Cruiser segment was up five percentage points in the quarter.","So the product is very well received. It's driving its indented result, but it is facing a huge headwind with regards to the overall industry being down on a full year basis of 7.3%. And so our product is hit in the mark, but it is not enough to turn the inventory or the industry headwinds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino","Clarifying this of the 32,000 more Harley riders that you quoted, one, what percentage purchased a new bike as opposed to a used bike this year? And two, what do you estimate your acquisition cost or dollar investment is per new Harley rider?","Matthew Levatich","The breakdown of the 32,000, I don't have that answer in our fingertips. Of course, when you look at overall new and used motorcycles, about 2.5 times are used or 2.5 times more are used than new. And I'm sorry, the second question was? The acquisition cost per riders, we do not provide a breakdown of our marketing spending in that level of detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","So I'm curious how you guys are now perceiving the total overall market potential for touring versus custom and then what you think the market potential for electric bikes is, given the announcement of the faster push into the electric bike market as you try to sort of fill that gap to get those two million new riders over the next 10 years? Thanks.","Matthew Levatich","I think I won't give you specific numbers, if you will. But we look at our products in the sense of how do they appeal to different types of markets spaces, what different types of riders are looking for in a product.","And our investment decisions, for example, to continue to invest in touring, how we balance that against investment decisions to, for example, redo the Softail platform, how we balance that, for example, with our investment in electric is all driven around markets spaces that we see, the mentality, if you will, different types of riders across the entire spectrum of riders and how we balance those investments to grow the company, to grow profitably, to continue to deliver the cash as we do that.","We see electric as being particularly exciting for not just new riders, not just young people. The demo ride that I referenced, 12,000 people around the world, the composition of those customers was all over the map for age and riding experience and even their look. The universal appeal of that product was what was the most astounding aspect of that initiative, and it gave us a lot of confidence that electric motorcycles have broad-based appeal, different used occasion.","They are going to sit alongside existing Harleys and garages as much as they're going to create new interest in the sport and in the brand with new types of riders. And so that's how we're \u2013 why we're providing the opportunity for the company long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","I guess, just wanted to ask my question on your relationship with the dealers and their frustrations. When you hold calls with your dealers, what do you hear back from them in terms of what they would like to see you do to turn this around?","Matthew Levatich","I think we have a lot of engagement opportunities with our dealers. And in fact, I was just at our retail readiness event in Nashville last week and spent a lot of time talking with dealers. We have formal meetings, we have informal meetings. I think the mentality shift that we're going through as a company is part of the shift that is happening as well in the dealer network, and that mentality shift [Audio Gap] build motorcycles or, if you're a dealer, we sell motorcycles.","Together, we build riders. Really, we used to be the uptake in the interest of the part of the dealers in the house of that shift, how can Riding Academy be better leveraged? How can dealers get into it if they're not into it already?","So there's a lot of really good positive energy in that space. I think they're all in on this business. They've got their livelihood and their personal pattern on the line in the business, and the ideas are flowing from the dealer network.","Sometimes, we have a calibration discussion about whether those ideas are the right ideas. For example, would a cheap motorcycle, a small motorcycle fix the problem or not? How do we think about that? How do we leverage their knowledge of retail to inform our product investments?","So we have, first of all, first and foremost, the most passionate, active, talented dealer network on the planet. They are actively invested in our business and invested in us and giving us the feedback we need to drive the business and it's a great moment actually right not to be leveraging that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Krystyna Metcalf","This is Krystyna on for Joe. Can you talk to us about the overall promotional intensity that you're seeing? And related to that, if the weaker U.S. dollar is giving foreign competitors greater ability for heightened promotions? Thanks.","John Olin","When we look at the fourth quarter, overall, promotional activity by the competition is similar as it was in the third quarter and similar on a year-over-year basis. We're not seeing a lot of change. We are starting to see certainly the euro strengthen, which we hope will lead to less discounting by Europeans manufacturers as we go forward. But overall, in the fourth quarter, the level of promotional intensity was similar to what we've seen in the past.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Just a follow-up question to Gerrick's who did miss a bit of that the first part. If you look out -- I think you mentioned that you didn't lose any sales to competitors. But when do you think those sales will be normalized? And do you -- would you expect to see some pent-up demand here in the first and second quarter from some of the scarcity or not?","Matthew Levatich","Greg, we believe that we will pick up sales that we didn't have in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter through the selling season. When you talk about pent-up demand, I'm not sure how to answer that question. We got overall headwinds. The industry is still very weak, and we expect that they would be continue to be weak in the United States next year.","So, those sales that we didn't get in the fourth quarter will certainly help out as we move through the selling season, but we still expect U.S. retail sales to be down in 2018.","Amy Giuffre","All right.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Heidi and good morning. You can access the slides supporting this call on harley-davidson.com. Click About Us at the top right, select Investors from the drop-down and click the Earnings Materials Box in the center of the page.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information on this call.","Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin. Matt, let's get started.","Matthew Levatich","Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. In our press release this morning, we noted highlights from the quarter among them strong EPS excluding manufacturing optimization costs, revenue growth, higher HDFS operating income and international retail sales growth versus last year.","We continue to make progress on our manufacturing optimization and see positive results from our commitment and actions to drive value for all stakeholders and maintain our brand premium, a corner stone of long-term value. We are also pleased with our cash generation and returns to shareholders through an increased dividend and share repurchases during the quarter.","Today, we are encouraged and focused, as many of our markets welcome spring. Last year we shifted our mindset from building motorcycles to building riders and on the momentum of the 2017 increase in the number of Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S. we embrace this time of year not only as the riding season, but also the building riders' season.","We are in the debut riding and selling season for our all new Softail motorcycle platform and we recently launched two additional 2018 motorcycles including our sixth offering with an MSRP under $10,000. Another great price and power entry into our brand, initial dealer and customer reaction confirms we hit the nail on the head with both new sportster model the Iron 1200 and the Forty-Eight Special.","All our new models reflect our brand promise of all for freedom, freedom for all and support our objective to build the next-generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally. As I mentioned last quarter, based on our data insights our focus on ridership is way more than just inspiring new riders, ridership is a bigger idea, one focused on keeping riders engaged, riding and importantly purchasing. Our actions are focused on building new riders and selling more Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products to fuel their passion.","In the U.S. dealers are offering our freedom promise, designed to reinforce value and still purchase confidence and drive repurchase and brand engagement. Purchasers of eligible streets and sportsters will get the purchase price back on a trade within a year, a great option to riders who are discovering the riding style and the type of bike that suits them.","In the first weeks of the program, dealers were seeing new customers coming in and believe this program dovetails nicely with a launch of the new sportsters. And there is more marketing and sales support queued up to deliver our spring sales goals, targeted programs to encourage the millions of hand raisers to take the next step in becoming a Harley-Davidson rider.","Regarding our international performance, we are encouraged with a return to retail sales growth in Q1. The Softails have the mark and our test rides and conversion rates continue to improve in many of our international markets, as our teams and dealers continue to leverage the impact of test rides on Milwaukee-Eight powered Softails and touring models, the power, torque and handling of these motorcycles speaks for itself and there is no better way than a test ride to make that known in the hyper competitive international markets.","We continue to expand our reach and impact with new dealer openings on track and with the opening of our first lifestyle retail stores in China, India and Korea during the quarter. Our strategy to engage with a larger audience through dedicated brand apparel stores is live and underway, helping to introduce Harley-Davidson to a new generation in Asia.","Whether it's vigorous product competition abroad or challenged industry here in the U.S. we are encouraged by opportunities we see in our brand and are launching products and executing programs that will leave no free spirit behind.","Looking forward to the balance of 2018 and beyond, this summer we plan to reveal significant additional steps, we'll take to enhance our long-term strategy and accelerate performance through 2022. Our view of the highly competitive global motorcycle market is grounded in a realistic assessment of the risks, opportunities and capabilities needed to inspire ridership and grow our business.","Our data driven insights compel us to enhance our strategies to ensure we deliver our long-term objectives and build the next-generation of riders. As we work to refine our plans, I can share with you today that we're being aggressive and innovative in how we view the work we must do to strengthen our company, our brand and the sport. We see our path as expressed in our 2027 objectives as absolutely on point, we must create the next-generation Harley-Davidson riders by inspiring people with new types of Harley-Davidson products and new ways to express their individuality and spirit. People who may find their path to freedom on two wheels differently than those before them.","This summer we'll convey very specific action plans to capitalize on global opportunities we see for growth. Plans that leverage our strengths as a company and brand while pushing the boundaries and limits, but our focus has been over our living history. Our aim is simple, drive result and value more quickly and do so in a way that is reinforcing of all we stand for as a brand and company.","We plan to enter into new product spaces, initiate new market channels, and establish partnerships and collaborations with proven leaders. We expect the effects and results will elevate this great company and brand. A brand and brand promise with broad global appeal. Our efforts will open our doors to the millions more that are seeking a reason to be and a reason to join. Simply the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders.","As we said on the January call, we're being aggressive in seeking and prioritizing opportunities that drive profitability and cash flow, improve the company's current growth trajectory and leverage our significant capabilities, assets, dealers and employees to deliver strong returns.","And when we finalized the specifics, know that we will invest in opportunities that support our 10 year objectives and that deliver strong cash flow, top quartile ROIC and value for to our shareholders.","We also said on the January call, that we're increasing our investment in electric motorcycle technology to accelerate our growth strategy and position the company as the leader in the electrification of motorcycles. We said we expect to invest an incremental $25 million to $50 million of annual operating margin in EV technology and products over the next several years and bring our first selected motorcycle to market before 2020.","As part of that effort, we announced last month our investment in and collaboration with Alta Motors, a true innovator in light weight electric motorcycle technology. Working together on technology and new product development will fuel our ability to reach customers and non-traditional spaces with a full array of premium products more quickly.","Our excitement about EV technology is born of our mindset shift to build great riders not just great motorcycles. Last year, we issued the typical machine based perspective and put the rider first in all of our thinking. This shift in mindset already unlocked new ways of thinking. It allowed us to clearly see our used motorcycles in the U.S. as a path to bring new riders into the Harley-Davidson experience.","It triggered the EagleRider partnership to provide more avenues for people to experience our great motorcycles. It was a catalyst for the work we're doing with rider development and how our riding academy can be augmented both before and after the class itself to ensure people interested in riding became confident, safe and avid riders. And it has driven us to take a deeper look at what more we can do to accelerate our progress.","While our enhanced strategic plan is about driving significant growth sooner and for the long-term, we also maintain our determination to optimize near-term performance. As I noted earlier, we have smart traffic driving stimuli [ph] in place in the U.S. to encouraged spring sales momentum, and we continue to expect international sales to be up year-over-year.","We also remain resolute in our focus to aggressively manage for balanced supply of new motorcycles in the retail channel and position the company and our cost structure to better compete in challenging and competitive markets the world over.","Our disciplined supply management actions continue to support lean retail inventory and we saw used bike price improvement in the U.S. for the third straight quarter. Our manufacturing optimization is progressing as we anticipated and we're on track to deliver expected annual ongoing savings.","Also, we expect our new Thailand manufacture plant to begin production later this year. This plant will support more competitive retail pricing by eliminating much of the tax and tariff burden that fully assembled imports carry in important growth markets in Asia. We expect more competitive pricing will drive profitable share and increase demand. Volume growth that would not materialized had the motorcycles been shipped from U.S. and subject to import duties.","In summary, we enter this year with awareness of the headwinds we face, and we're making progress against our plans to address challenges both near and long-term in nature. We're moving forward with determination and creativity leveraging the significant potential of our great brand to accelerate our performance and propel us toward growth with the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders around the world.","Now, John will walk you through financial details for the first quarter. John?","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. During the first quarter Harley-Davidson posted strong financial results despite prolong weakness in the U.S. industry sales performance. In the phase of ongoing retail sales headwinds we remained focused on reducing U.S. retail inventory, reducing costs and investing in our strategy to drive value for our riders, dealers and shareholders.","The summary of our Q1 results is on slide 11. In the first quarter revenue was up despite decreased shipments compared to last year's first quarter. As planned motorcycle operating income was down behind a $46.8 million restructuring charge and increased SG&A. Financial services had a very strong quarter with operating income up 20.8%. Consolidated net income was down 6.2% due to lower operating income, partially offset by a benefit of considerably lower tax rate.","EPS was $1.03 when excluding manufacturing optimization costs EPS was $1.24. Please note that we adopted a new accounting pronouncement, which resulted in classifying certain pension items in non-operating income. Accordingly we have reclassified last year's results to be comparable. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term despite significant near-term headwinds.","On slide 12, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q1 were down 7.2% versus prior year. Sequentially the year-over-year Q1 sales rate improved compared to the Q4 2017 sales rate, which was down 9.6%.","In the U.S. as we expected Q1 retail sales continue to be adversely impacted by very weak U.S. industry sales. In International markets we experienced retail sales growth that was slightly ahead of our expectations behind strong performance in Europe and Latin America. We expect our year-over-year Q2 worldwide retail sales rate to improve compared to the Q1 rate. For the full year, we continue to expect retail sales to be down in the U.S. albeit at a slower rate than we experienced in Q1. We expect U.S. declines to be partially offset by growth in international retail sales.","We recognize this was another difficult quarter for the industry, however we are encouraged by our strong revenue growth, international retail sales growth, our U.S. dealers inventory position and certainly by the actions we're taking to build ridership.","Let's take a closer look at the U.S. on slide 13. U.S. retail sales were down 12.0% in Q1, which was within our range of expectations, but at the low end. The U.S. industry was down 11.1% we believe the new motorcycle industry sales continue to be adversely impacted by soft used bike prices.","Sales of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles continue to outperform sales of new, despite increased used bike prices for the third straight quarter in dealerships in the broader market. Also Q1 used Harley-Davidson wholesale prices at auctions increased above year ago levels. And pricing services such as NADA and Black Book continue to publish higher retail values year-over-year for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Stronger used bike prices reinforce our disciplined focus on driving premium value for our riders, dealers and the brand.","Moving on to new motorcycle market share Harley-Davidson's share in the quarter remained at a very healthy 50.4%. Our share was down 0.9 percentage points on limited availability of new motorcycles and a highly competitive marketplace. While market share remains a key focus the slight contraction in our first quarter market share came with a more profitable mix and less promotional support than in the prior year.","We remain focused on our approach to optimize profitability and maximize brand value. At the end of the quarter retail inventory was down approximately 9,100 motorcycles compared to the prior year. We believe our discipline to reduce supply and improve model year mix in the U.S. retail channel delivered the intended results and retail inventory was well positioned as we move into the selling season.","On slide 14, international retail sales in Q1 were up on a year-over-year basis and slightly better than our expectations. As we expected our Q1 retail sales rate significantly improved from the Q4 2017 sales rate. During the quarter retail sales were driven by strong growth in EMEA and Latin America largely offset by weak sales in Asia Pacific and Canada. In EMEA, Q1 retail sales were up a strong 6.8% versus prior year. We experienced growth across most Western European markets, partially offset by lower retail sales in emerging markets.","In Europe, our sales were up 8.1% in the quarter and our market share was up 1.3 percentage points. Harley-Davidson's retail sales and market share gains were driven by strong sales growth of the new Softail motorcycles. The year-over-year retail sales rate in Asia Pacific region continue to be soft in Q1, which showed sequential improvement compared to the Q4 rate.","During the first quarter Asia Pacific retail sales were adversely impacted by lower sales in Australia and Japan. We are addressing these markets by focusing on national test ride campaigns and providing finance offers to help dealers close sales. Emerging markets in the region were also soft behind a lack of inventory in China, as our model year 2018 motorcycles were not homologated and approved for shipment into China until March 29th, which was later than the year ago period.","We experienced strong Q1 retail sales growth in Latin America, which was offset by a decline in Canada. Finally, in line with our strategy to increase brand access internationally, we continue to expand our international dealer network and added seven new dealers during the quarter.","We remain confident in and committed to the great potential that international markets offer to Harley-Davidson, we continue to leverage our brand, products and distribution opportunities to drive sustainable growth in international markets.","On slide 15, wholesale motorcycle shipments were down 9.7% in the quarter and within our shipment guidance range. Touring as a percent of total shipments was significantly higher compared to last year's first quarter when we constrain touring shipments to allow dealers to focus on selling through the model year 2016 touring motorcycles ahead of the 2017 bikes, which feature the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. In the second quarter, we expect touring as a percent of total shipments to be down as the overall mix returns to a more normal allocation.","On slide 16, revenue for the motorcycle segment was up in the first quarter despite significantly lower year-over-year motorcycle shipments. On January 1st, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which includes some shifting of revenue between line items and the breakout of licensing revenue, prior year has been reclassified to make revenues comparable.","Q1 average motorcycle revenue per unit was up over last year's first quarter. The increase was due to a richer product mix, favorable currency exchange and higher pricing. P&A and general merchandise revenue growth significantly outperform motorcycle retail sales during the quarter, impart driven by favorable currency exchange.","On slide 17, gross margin in Q1 was largely flat behind very strong product mix, favorable currency exchange and higher pricing, offset by decreased shipments, higher manufacturing expense and rising raw material costs. Manufacturing expense was unfavorable versus prior year, driven by lower absorption on lower production and shipments and higher depreciation. Raw material costs have been rising primarily behind increasing steel and aluminum prices.","On slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q1 was 12.7% down 5.1 percentage points compared to last year. Operating margin percent was adversely impacted by higher SG&A spending as we invested in higher levels of marketing and prior product development and a $46.8 million restructuring charge related to our manufacturing optimization.","Profitability and strong cash flow are our key focus, it is our aim to further leverage our established capabilities to continue to drive profit, cash flow and top quartile ROIC into the future.","HDFS's Q1 operating income shown on slide 19, increased 20.8% compared to last year. Operating income was positively impacted by a lower provision for retail loan losses of $14.2 million, driven by lower credit losses and a slight reduction in the reserve rate compared to a rising reserve rate in Q1 of 2017. Net interest income was down $1.9 million due to higher borrowing costs.","HDFS's operational results are on slide 20. Origination were down 8.3% versus prior year and driven by lower retail sales in the U.S., market share was down 4.3 percentage points during the quarter compared to last year, as we lap a 6.1 percentage point gain, driven by finance offers to support sell through of non-current touring motorcycles.","At the end of the quarter there was $350.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $1.12 billion of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities. During the quarter HDFS paid a dividend of $110 million to Harley-Davidson Inc.","On slide 21 the 30 day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet at the end of March was 3.31% or 14 basis points higher than Q1 2017. The annualized retail credit loss rate for receivables on balance sheet was 2.15% or 16 basis points lower than 2017. We were encouraged to see a year-over-year decline in credit losses after having experienced an extended period of increases as credit losses have normalized.","HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on slide 22. Operating cash was up $31.7 million or nearly 20% driven by lower wholesale financing during the quarter.","Our effective tax rate was 24.1% in the first quarter, which was considerably lower than last year largely due to the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. And finally regarding liquidity the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and or committed credit facilities.","We believe that charts on slide 23 demonstrate that we are in the class of our own when it comes to generating cash and returning cash to our shareholders. We benchmark very well against various peer groups for the period of 2015 to 2017.","One of our five objectives guiding our business strategies and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by motor company ROIC and the top quartile of the S&P500 and by a best-in-class return on equity at HDFS. Harley-Davidson is a leader in ROIC at the motor company and ROE at HDFS. As indicated on the slide Harley-Davidson is a clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash.","Slide 24 illustrates our recent history of returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of 2018 we increased our dividend to $0.37 per share and repurchased 1.4 million shares for $65.1 million. Driving superior value for our stakeholders is our top priority.","We will continue to look for opportunities to grow value first and foremost by disciplined investments to maximize the performance and long-term potential of the company and the brand. We have a robust process for our investment decisions and we are disciplined to it. After investing in our business we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases.","On slide 25 is a summary of our expectations of our multiyear manufacturing optimization initiative. We expect this optimization to result in a reduction to operating income of $170 million to $200 million through 2019, of which roughly 30% will be non-cash write-downs of existing assets. We also plan to invest approximately $75 million of capital and expect annual ongoing cash savings of between $65 million to $75 million after 2020.","We believe these investments have very attractive returns, when completed we expect this initiative will simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus in our operational investments and improved gross margin by approximately 1.25 percentage points. During the first quarter we initiated the manufacturing optimization and incurred $46.8 million of restructuring expense, driven primarily by employee severance and accelerated depreciation. We also incurred $0.7 million in related temporary inefficiencies.","A summary of our expectations for 2018 is on slide 26. Our expectations for 2018 are largely unchanged however there are a few things to note. First, due to strong first quarter results at HDFS we now expect HDFS operating income will be flat to down modestly. Second, as we noted last quarter operating income has been adjusted to exclude certain components of pension expense.","We adopted a new accounting pronouncement in 2018, which require certain pension costs to be recorded in non-operating income. This change has been implemented retrospectively. We expect full year non-operating income of about $2 million in 2018 compared to $9.2 million in 2017. The reduction is due to higher amortization of actuarial losses following the first quarter remeasurement of our pension plans required as a result of the consolidation of our U.S. assembly plants.","Next, we continue to expect to incur approximately $120 million to $140 million of costs to execute our manufacturing optimization initiative during the year. Of that total, we expect second quarter manufacturing optimization charges to be approximately $20 million.","And finally, we continue to expect to ship 231,000 to 236,000 motorcycles in 2018. In the second quarter we expect to ship approximately 67,500, to 72,500 motorcycles down 11% to 18%. Given Q1 actual shipments and our expectations for Q2 shipments, we expect first half shipments to be down 11% to 14%. Consequently to achieve our full year shipment guidance of down 2% to 4% we expect back half shipments to be up roughly 12%.","We believe this shipment cadence will result in tight U.S. retail inventory through the selling season and an improved level of carryover inventory at model year changeover. Timing of shipments is expected to result in flat year-end retail inventory in the U.S. and it supports our very disciplined supply strategy, which we believe is delivering its intended results.","Finally we expect the shipment cadence will also impact timing of our operating margin in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. In the second quarter we expect motorcycle operating margin to be down approximately 5 percentage points versus last year behind the following impacts.","First as I mentioned unfavorable shipment mix; second, approximately $20 million of manufacturing optimization costs, also lower fixed absorption behind lower shipments, which we expect to recover in Q3; and finally SG&A up behind higher investment in marketing and product development compared to last year.","To wrap up, we continue to be disciplined in our management of supply, drive premium value for our dealers, riders and our brand, amplify our costs management efforts and relentlessly focus on our long-term objectives. We look forward to finalizing and revealing our plans to accelerate our strategy to build the next-generation of Harley-Davidson riders. We will continue to focus our investments, deliver strong returns to shareholders and drive growth for the company for the long-term.","Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Hey, good morning, thank you for taking my question. Matt, I wanted to ask you a question about this big data project you have been investing in to understand rider behavior better, that seems to be informing your 2022 plan and I know you are still refining that. But I am curious what's your initial assessment of that data suggests about the U.S. market, about millennial buyers and about your international opportunities?","Matthew Levatich","Thanks, Craig and good morning. It has a wealth of information and in fact I think we're just at the tip of the iceberg it really fully taken advantage of all that it has to offers. As we said in the January call, there were 257,000 new to Harley-Davidson riders in 2017. I would say that that number was larger than we expected and it also implies that the people that exited was also larger than we expected.","So the flow through the sport is more than we thought, I guess that we that would have thought initially and that represents the opportunity for us as we see movement how do we channel that movement, how do we look at the competitive movement from competitors into Harley and how do we better leverage the tools like riding academy and so forth to increase the number of new riders.","And I said in my opening remarks it emphasizes the importance of ridership in a bigger sense. How do we keep existing riders riding and participating, that's a huge lever for us to pull to keep the sport vital and keep people active and keep the number of riders up the way we needed to be for the long-term.","So, I would say Craig it's early days, the insights are tremendous that we have already received the teams continue to dig and mine for other insights including competitive flows that help us sharpen our efforts and target our investments. But it's a tremendous asset that we have as a company that we're continuing to find new ways to leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning. Couple of questions, maybe you could comment on what are you seeing so far in April? And also what your retail would have been if you include used products, so total demand for the Harley brand. And the last one is Riding Academy, how many dealers do you have now, how many do you plan on having in the future in Riding Academy? Thank you.","Matthew Levatich","Thanks, Gerrick. We don't comment on the in-quarter, but what we can say is whether that started out in April, was pretty difficult around the United States in terms of temperature as well as precipitation. So, overall a little bit slower start than we would like driven entirely by weather, it reminds me as yesterday I drove in the work and saw the last of the snow melting away here in Milwaukee. So, weather is breaking and we're very excited about the spring selling season starting in earnest.","John Olin","I think the second question that you ask Gerrick was with regards to retail sales of have used and new, if I got the question right. We are a month lagged on used retail sales, but when we look at the marketplace through January and February, used was down a bit in the first two months. Again cautious on - these are two of the smallest months that we have with used was down as was new.","And then finally the question - the third question was with regards to Riding Academy, I think we train last year 62,000 riders in Riding Academy, we would expect to do a little bit more than that this year. We're off to start the first quarter, we had good conversion rates one of our focuses. So conversion of people buying those motorcycles is improving and the folks that are buying bikes that took the class compared to last year is also up on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So, I wanted to square a couple things here, and we've talked about some of this before, so used pricing sounds encouraging it was up year-over-year I think you said this is the third straight quarter, but as we think about the declines particularly in the U.S., which are pretty large obviously, used pricing continues to be the primary culprit there that you guys talk about.","So maybe, square those two things is the gap between new and used any smaller than it was a year ago, which would maybe be the better metric to think about. The new bike that you are selling right now as opposed to some of the used bikes. And I guess in your answer to the previous question, total demand, it sounds like it's down in the first couple of months and it sounds like it was flat to down last year, why do you think total demand is decelerating as I think about that whole used to new dynamic?","Matthew Levatich","Thanks, James. So, as you pointed out we're very pleased to see used bike prices rising and as we talked about we look at used bikes in three different areas. One is at auction, which really tends to kind of trigger the changes in prices and auction prices were up in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis and actually that represents the fifth straight quarter it was a year ago first quarter that we first turned used bike prices at auctions around or saw them start to rise [technical difficulty]. So auction prices are up.","Second piece of it is with prices services are publishing. So they price - publish retail prices to people that want to use the data that are looking to buy used bikes and in the first quarter of this year that was also up. And when we look at NADA and Black Book and look at a two year old Harley on a comparable basis year-over-year one of the services had us up on an average of 4% and the other up an average of 7%.","So that goes a long way to starting to close that gap that we see between new and used. But those are pricing services that published in books, now we need to see that translate to the broader market. And in the first quarter we did see prices of used motorcycles that are transacting in our dealerships and data that we get outside of - other dealerships outside of ours is Harley-Davidson motorcycle used bike prices are increase.","So we're moving in right direction and that would be three months or three quarters within our dealer network that we've seen that rise. But again we're fighting off a 13 quarter decline and a pretty large price gap. So we are moving in the right direction and seeing that gap, close a little on a year-over-year basis. We couldn't be more focused on that and certainly our actions of how we're managing our inventory are helping to drive that outcome.","I think the next question you asked is with regards to total demand. Total demand is starting to turn a little bit negative, in the back half of last year it started to be slightly negative and in the first couple of months again I take it with a lot of grains of salt because of the small sales months and weather plays a huge part in the first quarter. But it was down a bit.","Used are still well outperforming new, but overall total demand is down a bit and those are the things that we've been talking about and that is why we've got a long-term focus on building riders and going back to the question that Matt just answered is we couldn't be more focused on building riders and we're seeing good things come of that.","We had more riders in 2017 riding Harley-Davidsons than in the history of the company both new and used, but we are fighting some near-term headwinds with regards to the U.S. industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joseph Altobello","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to kind of dive into the 2Q shipment outlook little bit more in detail. If you look at the numbers it sounds like you guys felt pretty good about inventory coming out of the first quarter. And if my math is correct assuming international is up a bit it looks like the U.S. shipment number will be down about 20% in the second quarter. And then secondly to that you're looking for a big jump in the second half you do have a tough compare in the fourth quarter. So help us understand the dynamics of that shipment guide versus 2Q as well as in the back half? Thanks.","John Olin","Great, Joe. So when we look at the shipment outlook for Q2 it is to be down 11% to 18%, I think you mentioned 20%, but it will be down in the range of down 11% to 18%. We do not expect in any way shape or form retail sales to be down that amount. So we will take more inventories out of the system in the second quarter.","And as you had mentioned Joe, we feel very good about where we ended up in the first quarter we took out 9,100 units in the first quarter and that was on top of taking out 8,000 in the year ago quarter. So we've significantly tightened things up and again we're seeing the intended results of doing that. So we feel good about it we'll see more of that in the second quarter. And that will allow us again to have a tight system moving into model year changeover, which will happen in August.","Now to get to and address your question on the back half you're absolutely right. If you take our first quarter actuals down 9.7% in shipments our second quarter expectations down 11% to 18% our first half will be down about 11% to 14%. And to get to shipment growth of 2% to 4% down we would need the shipment on average about 12% more in the second half of the year. That does not mean to say that we expect retail sales to be up 12%. What that is as much more of a function of what happened last year than what is happening this year.","This year we're normalizing our shipments across the four quarters making sure that we are diligently managing inventories in the first half in the selling season of the year. But really what you're seeing is what happened last year and if you recall last year we had a very tough second quarter, the industry had a tough second quarter, and that required us to call down volumes in the third quarter.","We took out a lot of volumes in shipments and production out of the third quarter. And so last year was not a normal shipment cadence. We're making it normal this year. And so we will ship in more products in the back half because we took it out of the back half last year.","So hopefully that helps, overall we expect our shipments to be down 2% to 4% we feel good as to where we sit today with regards to that overall shipment guidance and we are managing the inventories to make sure that we continue to drive things that we're seeing in retail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. I was hoping that maybe you could help us frame the opportunity on the electric motorcycle side from your research kind of from a demand perspective what percent of consumers that are interested in that kind of vehicle might be new to motorcycles? And then are the demographics very different from the traditional Harley rider? And how do you expect that demand to kind of look U.S. versus overseas?","Matthew Levatich","Thank you, Sharon, that's a great question, its Matt here. We couldn't be more excited about what electric technology represents for both inspiring and enabling people to join the sport. Our Livewire investment back beginning in June at 2014 the demo rides that we did about 12,000 people worldwide, we took those motorcycles out to real riders in real settings around the world.","The feedback that we got was phenomenal and that feedback was from across the entire demographic spectrum obviously these were on road trials. So these were existing motorcyclists. But many of the people that road and myself included were inspired by the ease with which the electric technology enables people to ride, people commenting that it's easier to ride than a bicycle for example.","The way Livewire was constructed it's very light and nimble and maneuverable with excellent throttle responses, no shifting, no clutch, no heat, the slow speed maneuverability makes it particularly useful in urban settings where our traditional product doesn't necessarily - that is the sweet spot for existing traditional product.","So we see electric as playing a very key role in opening up new spaces and opportunities for the company to grow with different demographics and in different settings and including international, in particular urban. And the partnership arrangement with Alta around their technology and our ability to incorporate that into other lighter weight EV products is part of that learning and that knowledge that we have about how we use EV to open up growth channels for the company. Different people, in different places with different ideas about how they want to if you will experience freedom on two wheels.","So we're excited about it, that's all that I can share at this stage, but we'll reveal more this summer. So, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Great, thank you. A couple of questions, one is, you mentioned that you feel better about the year-over-year retail declines in the U.S. moderating over the course of this year, if you can just give us a little bit of inside into what is driving that expectation?","Secondly, the work with Alta, could that actually accelerate or change the trajectory of electric motorcycle launches. And then lastly any comments on steel just given the volatility of that commodity and how you're looking at that affecting your numbers this year?","John Olin","Alright Rod, I'll take the first and third and I'll leave the second for Matt. When we look at the year and how we really ended last year in terms of pretty weak retail sales, if you recall on a worldwide basis, retail was down 9.6% in the fourth quarter, again the fourth quarter is our smallest quarter and highly volatile as is the first quarter. But as we plan this year out, we were looking for certainly sequential improvement as we moved into the first and second quarter and we got that improvement in the first quarter.","In the U.S., we were looking at double-digit decline and it ended up being a little bit more than that, certainly disappointing driven by the U.S. industry, but not out of line with what we were expecting. International was a little bit different, actually international we were planning the first quarter to be down and it came in up slightly. So very pleased with that.","So as we sit here at the end of the first quarter, we're in line with our expectations for the year and to delivering our full year shipment guidance. And we are looking for that sequential improvement to move into the selling season. So, again we feel good as to where we're at right now.","The second quarter - the second question that you asked Rod is with regards to steel prices and if you don't mind I am going to expand that question a little bit out into the overall tariff situation. If you recall our guidance coming into the year, we talked about raw materials and we expected raw materials to be up. And in the first quarter they were up, they were unfavorable by $4.2 million and I want to make that clear that that was largely driven by steel and aluminum rising, but that was not driven by the tariff announcement that we saw in the middle of February.","So we expect raw materials to be up and they are in the first quarter. In the middle of February as everyone knows the U.S. government came out and announced tariffs on steel and aluminum 25% and 10%. Since that announcement in middle of February we have seen aluminum and steel prices rise even further and the broad markets were up anywhere from 5% to 15% I think steel is up about 15% and aluminum is up about 5% as of yesterday.","So with that we expect even higher unfavorability in the raw materials part of our P&L. So looking at the impact of tariffs every information that we have now shows a highly volatile situation who is in who is out and what's happening to market prices. But we would expect an additional $15 million to $20 million on top of already rising raw materials that we expected at the start of the year.","So that's going to provide quite a headwind for the company over the next several quarters. Again we didn't see it in the first quarter, it will start the flow through inventory and into our P&L in the second through fourth quarters. And we're looking at ways to mitigate it, we're holding our operating margin guidance that puts a little bit of pressure on that. But looking for ways to mitigate the unplanned increase in steel and aluminum.","Matthew Levatich","So Rod, this is Matt and I'll build a little bit off my comments to Sharon's question. The Alta investment and partnership is really about products beyond the EV product that we're planning to launch by 2020, which is really a derivative based on Livewire. So the research from Livewire as well as our consumer research kind of going back to Craig's question about looking at the rider migration knowledge base that we have.","This is all about the EV portfolio beyond that initial Livewire derivative. And as I mentioned in my comments Alta is really an expert in lighter weight EV technology. So you can start to imagine that younger urban consumer and the technology, and the price point if you will of EV that Alta brings to the party for us opening doors to those growth opportunities for the company.","That's really all that I'll say right now, that's what the investments about, we'll talk more about it, I think we'll talk very specifically about it this summer what we see the EV landscape representing to the company's portfolio and our growth prospects as well as the value that we will build for shareholders as a result of this part of our strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. John thanks for the commentary on the balanced capital allocation. I wanted to probe it a little bit further because if you look back at 2017 and the dividends and buybacks return were a little bit over $700 million, which is almost all your total company free cash flow and certainly more than the free cash flow just from the motorcycle company. And it seems like a similar dynamic play out this quarter so we think about 2018 when your guidance does imply lower free cash flow is that the dynamic we should continue to expect where almost all of it is returned?","And if so I just wanted to understand some of your thinking as to why you should continue to do that now as you embark on this phase of reinvestment and restructuring and you might not even know all the opportunities lie ahead of you.","And then I also had just want a housekeeping clarification, it looks like you called out the nearly $47 million in restructuring and based on the prior gross margin guidance I was sort of under impression and maybe this is my error that it would run through there. So, I guess, I just want to understand when you say flat gross margins ex-manufacturing optimization is that just the temporary inefficiencies that you called out in the walk or is that all ex-all manufacturing optimization? Thanks.","John Olin","Thank you Joe. I'll answer the second one first. With regards to the manufacturing optimization it's made up of two costs that will hit the P&L in two different places, one is temporary inefficiencies and that is slowing lines down to move equipment and so on and so forth the duplicate resources as we keep one plant running and move equipment. We expect that to be $20 million to $25 million and that will hit in gross margin.","The second piece is restructuring, which is largely severance accelerated depreciation moving equipment and those type of costs that's $100 million to $150 million. So the total of $120 million to $140 million is what it will cost us to garner those savings of 65% to 75% ongoing. If you exclude the $120 million to $140 million out of this year's result, we would expect operating margin and gross margin to be largely flat to last year to 2017's results. I hope that helps Joe.","Secondly is with regards to capital allocation, we have said many times, as we just said in the preamble, is that we will invest the cash that we have in great returns to deliver top quartile ROIC. We will continue to do that, we're doing that this year and coming out this summer, we'll talk more about opportunities that we have to invest our free cash flow in great opportunities to deliver shareholder returns.","Beyond what we invest in the business we will return and continue to return all excess cash to our shareholders. So first we will find the great projects that drive top quartile ROIC and beyond that we will deliver those - that cash to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends and share repurchases.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Just John and Matt I had some questions your international business, I was just wondering if there was a way to think about same store sales in international I'm just trying to figure out how much the growth of the new dealership help drive the international growth in the quarter?","And then also if you just want to look at one quarter as a trend then it does look like international sales have turned. So with the continuous steep declines in the U.S. and the market share losses there I'm just wondering what you can take from your learnings internationally and apply to the U.S? And then just one part of the tariff that you didn't touch on is, is it affecting demand internationally at all or is that something you are concerned about?","John Olin","Thanks, Felicia. Felicia, we do not major sales on same-store basis. I know it's very common in some retail environments, we don't do it, but if you look at the quarter, EMEA was up 6.8%, we didn't add a lot of new dealerships, it's been more steady and in terms of overall dealerships. So same-store dealer sales were up a fair amount.","The corollary to that is an AP, AP retail sales were down in the quarter 7.8%, still struggling with areas in Australia and Japan. And with that our same-store sales are down and there is where we've added some of those, the majority of that seven dealerships that we opened were in that market.","So, we've got a mix of both going on international in particular in Asia-Pacific has been on a tough slog over the last couple of quarters. And we believe the back half of the year will certainly improve in Asia-Pacific. But overall same-store sales in the last couple of year in international have been down as we've added dealerships and have not added overall growth in those markets.","Second is with regards to the tariff. And are we seeing the tariff effect demand internationally. The answer is no, there is no change to our prices due to the tariffs at this point. So there would be no consumer change in the overall tariffs. There haven't been any tariffs on our products internationally, so the costs hasn't change.","Certainly one of the concerns is potentially retaliatory tariffs. We have been cited by the EU in terms of putting tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles if the U.S. government goes through with tariffs on steel and aluminum for the countries in EU. So we're keeping the close eye on that working with trade groups and the various trade officials in both countries to work through that, but no we have not seen any impact of the tariff on our sales either in United States or international markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. So just one question and a follow-up. So you've had two model years of very innovative new products well received by the dealers that we talk to and others, I'm sure, but it didn't drive retail sales. So I'm assuming that's more of a marketing issue and you did talk about some of your plans with different this year for the upcoming year and when your new products come out in the summer that maybe is different than the previous year or two.","And then also just a follow-up on the weather comment, you mentioned April is a little bit - was a slow start, does that mean that April was actually - the growth rate was weaker than the 12% decline you saw in the first quarter? And then did you also see a weather impact in the first quarter?","John Olin","So, Greg I'll start with your second quarter question first, because I can remember the best is with regards to April weather, we're not - we don't provide in quarter retail sales, it was just the comment that overall weather was pretty difficult in the first couple of month of April, I don't think that's a surprise to anyone. I think there's only two parts in the United States, Florida and a little bit of Arizona that had better than normal weather during that first two weeks of April.","With regards to the first quarter, we don't see a big impact of weather. When you look at it, look last year's - our first quarter temperatures and precipitation was really in line with normal levels. 2017 was certainly better than the average, but we were at average weather in the first quarter. Some places in the northeast a little bit out west with the rain did affect us. When we look at some of our regions the northeast region was behind the overall average sales. So weather had a little bit of impact, but not enough to really talk about for the first quarter.","Second question was with regards model year - or I am sorry new product, we have come out with absolutely spectacular product and you're right Greg and thanks for pointing that out dealers love it, customers love it and our riders love it. But it hasn't delivered the results, in particular in the United States and the headwinds on the industry have been very significant.","And with the price gaps that we have got, I tend to call it bad economics out there sometimes is that the price gaps are so large, it does impact our good product and our good marketing. We do not believe it is an issue with marketing, we think our marketing is fantastic and as we look at the key indicators of how we are reaching out to customers, marketing is strong.","We are seeing a dislocation in used bike prices and we are seeing more people despite the good product that we're bringing to market buy those used bikes and we talked about that earlier, used is outperforming new. So we just got big headwinds in the United States.","When we look at internationally where we don't have is issue - big of issues with price gaps, on the new Softails are selling absolutely fantastic. Europe, we're up 8% in 16 country and the market was down 7% in the first quarter and that's all driven by our great new product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I am curious about the mix of sales in the international markets, as this becomes the bigger part of the mix for the business. I am just trying to ascertain whether there might be more gross margin pressure or alleviation depending on whether touring in custom might be a bigger part of the mix, which it sounds like it is now versus the Sportster bikes? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Jaime. The overall allocation or mix of products internationally is at inherently lower mix. So in the United States over 50% of sales are touring bikes, internationally sportster and street make up a bigger percentage. So as we grow there will be pressure on overall margins, but we don't think that's any amount that we can't overcome. We've got a lot of focus on growing touring around the world and we have seen touring outgrow the rest of our portfolio in the last year. So we are focused on that and the new Softail is a very high margin product and that is growing very well.","So our overall product portfolio and lifecycle, we have a balanced mix of product coming out between high and not as high margin, we are managing the best we can. But as we grow internationally, we might see a little bit of headwind with regards to margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Couple of questions here, Matt or John, whoever wants to take this. You talked about the new partnership on the EV side and it sounds like you guys maybe hitting about something to be coming here in calendar 2018. But just in general within the broader framework Matt you talked about other sleeves and other things to grow the overall participation in ridership, could that be in other sleeves of motorcycling or even on the fringe or right outside of motorcycling?","Matthew Levatich","Thanks, Tim. To be clear and I mentioned earlier the Alta partnership is about the EV portfolio post the launch of the Livewire derivative, which we expect in about 18 months. So we're focused on opportunities to grow the business, reach new customers in new spaces, we see EV as a great opportunity as a part of doing that, not obviously the entire answer. As I mentioned earlier the ease of used suitability toward urban environments, the appeal to younger demographics we see EV being very critical in as a part of the mix in that growth vein for the company.","But there's no hinter or no suggestion that the Alta partnership is about anything sooner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Woolf from North Coast Research. Your line is open.","Seth Woolf","Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to take a step back big picture question on international market. Matt you had mentioned that with manufacturing facility going online abroad it's going to give you more favorable market pricing dynamics, which could lead to share gains, just curious if you've done any work to try to quantify what that could mean? And then John if it's a meaningful number how should we think about incremental margins in that business? Thank you.","Matthew Levatich","Thanks. I wouldn't - we see tremendous opportunity particularly in Southeast Asia and the investment in the plant in Thailand to get around the egregious [ph] tariffs and duties is a part of accessing the very important market. A market I would say by the way that most of our premium branded European competitors already have a beachhead, manufacturing in Thailand still they're already enjoying favorability at retail pricing. And we need to be there and be relevant and grow our share as well as our volume to have our dealers be profitable and so forth.","So it's very important to the long-term growth of the company as a segment within the international growth opportunity. And we plan to talk more about that as part of our discussion this summer on ways in which we can accelerate our growth trajectory.","John Olin","And Seth we talked a little bit about the mix is inherently as we grow international there will be pressure on overall margins nothing that we don't believe we can't manage through. And the other piece of it and much more important is the mix change because of growth is currency. No one has mentioned currency so I'll take the opportunity to mention it. We had a great quarter in terms of currency after two and half years of watching it go the other way. We garnered $15.5 million of gross margin in currency so that's a much bigger driver to overall margins than the shift that will happen overtime in terms of mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning. Just wondering maybe go back to very first question where you were asked about your big data work and or maybe just anecdotal commentary just coming back to the dealerships, but one of our concerns has just been people getting price out of the market at the higher end. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing more evidence now of consumers becoming more price sensitive. And so what's kind of the price point threshold where you're seeing a greatest change in purchasing behavior?","And then just secondly back to the raw material question, you gave the incremental for 2Q, 3Q, 4Q that's 15 to 20 should that be uniformly distributed or is it more skewed to the back half? Thanks.","Matthew Levatich","So David I'll take the first part of the question. We're not seeing in a specific sense what you alluded to with pricing. We have invested a tremendous amount in new product, we've added tremendous amount of value, part of that value is to separate new from used and that value carries commensurate increases in pricing the pricing we pay very close attention to what competitors are charging for new motorcycles to make sure that we continue to maintain our relative competitiveness in our market share in the United States. So we feel good about that.","Market share is very important is very strong we gave away a little bit of market share in the first quarter, but honestly nine tenth of a point on a 50% share is sort of normal variation. So we are focused on relative competitiveness to the competition, we're focused on adding value through our products, driving increased demand from existing riders and new riders.","And then obviously we've talked a lot about the used bike population and the dynamic that that has on the decisions that people make about whether to buy a new Harley or a used Harley. And I don't think I need to repeat all that. But all of those demand dynamics are part of our work to optimize our business in the United States, as we focus on ridership as the core goal, with other strategies to do that as well.","John Olin","And to add on to that just to point out that Softail, which we did raise the price with in the first quarter in that segment that it competes in large cruisers the market share was up nearly 9 percentage points. So I would say that people are accepting the value that we have added and certainly paying for it.","Secondly, David you asked about the cadence of potentially higher raw material costs of $15 million to $20 million, number one it's an estimate and it's based on what market prices are and they have been very volatile since the announcement of tariffs on February middle of February. But we would expect as our inventory flows through that most of it would get picked up in the second quarter, little bit less in the second quarter. And then full boat in the third and fourth quarter.","So I would say by and large equally between the quarters adjusted for sales volume, because we got higher quarters in the second and third, higher volumes flowing through. Net of all of that, a little bit higher in the second quarter, the highest in the third quarter, and little bit less in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Beckel from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","David Beckel","Thanks a lot, thanks for squeezing me in. Two quick questions and sort of follow-ups on previous questions. Around the acceleration in strategy you threw out some interesting words such as do spaces and channels. I was wondering if you could maybe just elaborate a little bit on how far adjacent you are willing to go strategically to accomplish your goals. And then as a follow-up to James prior question used bike pricing, I was wondering specifically - at what point do you think that rising used bike prices will actually have a positive effect on sales, as it seems like it hasn't really materialize as expected.","And are we right to continue to assume that an increase in used bike prices will positively affect sales going forward? Thanks.","Matthew Levatich","This is Matt, I would urge you to revisit my remarks in the preamble, because they are carefully chose we are being creative, we're being determined at how we grow value in our business and grow our overall business. We are diligently working on refining the strategies to accelerate our progress in line with our 2027 objectives and in keeping with who we are as a brand and the company leveraging our substantial strength.","Just to reassure everyone that we're being bold, we're being very open minded, but we're been very responsible and acknowledging the strengths that we can leverage and the opportunities that we can pursue. And we are looking forward to finalizing that work and getting out in front of our investors here this summer.","John Olin","And David with regards to your question, as how much more do we need before we see a different outcome. We don't have a percentage that says hey 5 more point were there or 7 points or 10 points everything is going to be good. What we have is a price dislocation now and a disparate growth between used and new motorcycles and as that gets balanced and that value equation comes back into line, we will see both new and used grow at about the same rate into the future.","So, I wish there was a way to say that here is one it would be and here is how long it will take. We're doing everything as a company to make sure that in the levers that we can pull that we are working at and the good news is, is that we're executing against our plan and it is delivering the intended results, but we still need to continue to close that gap.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino","Great, couple of questions. With the decline in U.S. sales both new and used, how are you thinking about your total amount of dealerships for the amount of sales you have currently? And then the second question, how do you think about the contribution margins on the new Softail comparing to call it 40% to 50% you've talked about traditionally given you've consolidated the architecture behind the vehicles?","Matthew Levatich","So this is Matt, David, I'll take the first question on the U.S. network. We actually feel very good about the composition and profile of the U.S. network and keep in mind they're leaning into the opportunity grow riders through our used business. So as independent businesses, they've got that lever to pull to maintain their profitability and when we think about strategies like riding academy.","And the other levers that we're pulling to both riders or dealers are a critical part of us achieving those strategies in the United States and we feel the coverage is very well placed to do that and we're working diligently with the dealers on strategies to be even more effective at that work.","John Olin","And your financial question David was with regards to contribution margin around Softail, we feel very good about where we're at, we increased price, but we also increase the cost of those. Overall margins are up slightly, we're seeing very good productivity in our plants, we'll see more of that comes as we've streamlined the number of engines and the number of frames that we have and really simplified things in the plants.","We did see good productivity in the first quarter, and the manufacturing line item was over shadowed by lower observation and higher depreciation costs, but we did drive good productivity in the factories partly due to the simplification of Softail offers and combining three different platforms into one.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, John and Matt. And thank you everyone for your patients as we try to get through other questions in the queue, we did not. So for those of you that are still in the queue I'll follow-up with you after the call today. And thanks everyone for your time.

[Operator Instructions] I'll now introduce and turn the call over to Ms. Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone. The audio for today's call is being webcast live on harley-davidson.com. The supporting slides can be accessed by clicking on Company, Investor Relations, then Events and Presentations.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, you'll hear from Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund. Then we'll open the call for your questions.","So let's get started. Keith?","Keith E. Wandell","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. We appreciate your spending this time with us today and for your interest in Harley-Davidson. As you saw on this morning's earnings release, Harley-Davidson reported continued strong performance, including EPS growth of 32% for the second quarter and retail sales that exceeded our expectations through the first 6 months. We believe these results are a reflection of the effective implementation of our business strategy, combined with strong dealer execution at retail. Our strategy provides the roadmap for success over the long term through exceptional product development, manufacturing and retail capabilities. And I want to recognize all the continued outstanding work by our employees, our dealers and suppliers who are making such a difference. Together, we're doing great things working as one team moving in one direction to deliver for our customers.","Among the many initiatives underway as part of Harley-Davidson's strategy is the installation of our ERP system at our vehicle operations in York. The migration of data from legacy systems to the new ERP system in early July went extremely well. This has been followed by a ramp up of production under the new ERP system in York, which also is going according to plan. You don't have to look any further than this truly outstanding job to understand the passion and the dedication of our employees.","The implementation of the ERP at York supports our efforts to introduce greater flexibility in manufacturing. In the years to come, we expect to have much greater ability to produce any bike on any line, anywhere. Among the other benefits, ERP enhances our ability to expand Harley-Davidson's leadership in factory customization over time. It's a win for the company, for our shareholders and our dealers and a big win for our customers.","A moment ago, I touched on Harley-Davidson's retail sales growth, and we, again, gained market share in the U.S. in the second quarter. We also continue to make progress at reaching new customer groups. One of our goals is to grow faster -- to grow sales faster to outreach customers than to core riders, and I'm pleased to report that in each of the past 3 quarters, we've done just that. And as we've noted previously, we are the U.S. market share leader among outreach customers, defined as young adults, women, African-American and Hispanic riders, a position we've held for the past 4 years.","So clearly, our products and the unique Harley-Davidson experience exert a powerful pull for many different groups of riders, and not just in the U.S., but around the world. We continue to deliver on our commitment to bring Harley-Davidson experience to more locations internationally. Since the beginning of the year, 12 new Harley-Davidson dealerships have opened in international markets, including Croatia, Russia, Taiwan, Poland and China. And while we are pleased with the progress in these and many areas of -- other areas of our operations, we're also being cautious in our expectations for retail in the back half of the year given the economic uncertainty in many markets. Dealer retail sales in a number of Eurozone countries in particular are reflecting the effects of the economic challenges. So we will continue to keep a close watch on those conditions.","This August is our kickoff for a year of epic experiences to celebrate our 110th anniversary. We've got 2 crews of riders heading out at the same time starting next week who will be blogging and sharing their adventures with their GoPro cameras. The first is a group of young athletes who have never been into Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, and they will be riding from Seattle to the Black Hills. Simultaneously, on the opposite side of the world, our Chief Marketing Officer, Mark-Hans Richer, and Asia Pacific Managing Director, Dave Foley, are celebrating with an amazing ride across Tibet, along with some of our new Chinese dealers. And anyone can go along on both of these epic 110th experiences through the online world of social networks at h-d.com\/110. Later this month, we're expecting a record number of Harley-Davidson dealers and staff from around the globe to gather in Milwaukee for our annual summer dealer meeting. The summer meeting is always a great time to connect with dealers, share our plans for the business and have some fun.","And at the end of every summer dealer meeting, we head off for a few days of riding with many of our dealers. It's a long-standing tradition and helps us connect with one another in what this business is all about. So in summary, it's been a great first half, and there's a lot to look forward to in the back half of the year and beyond. All of us are working hard every day to unleash the full potential of our company and our globally iconic brand. So thanks again for your continued interest, and now let me turn it over to John Olin.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results for the second quarter starting on Slide 9. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 14.9% behind the 25% increase in motorcycle shipments. Our second quarter income from continuing operations improved to $247.3 million, an increase of $56.7 million. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $1.07 per share, up from $0.81 in the year-ago quarter, a 32.1% increase.","Operating income for the Motorcycle business was $309.6 million, up 40.8% compared to last year's second quarter. The strong increase in the Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments, higher gross margin and favorable restructuring spending as compared to last year, partially offset by higher SG&A. Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was flat compared to last year's second quarter.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 10. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new motorcycles were up 2.8% in the second quarter and 9.3% year-to-date. Retail sales reflect our strong global brand and product appeal, but also reflect very challenging economic environments in many worldwide markets.","Moving on to Slide 11. As we expected, retail sales growth in the U.S. in the second quarter moderated from the first quarter, which benefited from an early and unusually warm spring, which pulled forward some sales from the second quarter. Sales in the U.S. were up 4.0% during the second quarter and 12.0% on a year-to-date basis.","U.S. market share strengthened by 1.2 percentage points to 55.1% in the second quarter versus prior year. Year-to-date, U.S. market share was up 2.3 percentage points to 56.1%, which is our highest June year-to-date market share on record. During the second quarter, we shipped all of the model year 2012 product from our company inventory in the U.S. as we prepared for the ERP implementation in York and for the cutover to our 2013 model year production. As a result, U.S. retail inventory was up 6,800 units versus a year ago. This retail inventory increase will help bridge dealers until we begin shipping model year 2013 motorcycles, which typically coincides with our summer dealer meeting. The meeting, which has historically happened in July, will occur in mid-to-late August in the future and is scheduled for August 20 this year. Despite the increase in retail inventory at the end of the second quarter, we continue to expect retail inventory in the U.S. will be below year-ago levels for most of the third quarter due to lower shipments versus prior year as a result of the production we have lost during the ERP implementation and due to the later date of the summer dealer meeting.","The chart in the lower right hand corner of Slide 11 illustrates how we expect the U.S. retail inventory will change between historical levels and future expectations. As we've discussed in the past few years, one of our key strategies is to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. This strategy, coupled with our new more flexible manufacturing capability, enables us to adjust the timing of motorcycle shipments, which we expect will result in retail inventory levels to be more in line with customer demand. We believe this will allow us to improve availability of motorcycles that customers want, when they want them, with greater operational efficiency for our dealers and the company.","As we have discussed, York will be capable of flexing its production in the first half of 2013, followed by Kansas City in the first half of 2014. Consequently, we expect U.S. retail inventory to be slightly lower in the future fourth quarters, which will be aligned with the seasonal low point for retail sales, and retail inventory to be modestly higher in future first, second and third quarters, also to better align with retail seasonality.","On Slide 12, you'll see retail sales in international markets for the quarter grew 0.5%, driven by strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by lower sales in the Europe region. During the second quarter, Latin America was up nearly 38%, driven by strong performance in Brazil, as the dealer network continues to gain momentum compared to last year second quarter when there were only a few dealers establishing their new businesses.","We remain very pleased with the progress of Brazil's dealer network and our future potential in the region. Retail sales in the Asia Pacific region were up 10.0%, driven by strong growth in Australia and in our emerging markets. We continue to be very excited about our businesses in India and China and our small but rapidly growing dealer network in these 2 key emerging markets. In Japan, retail sales fell as a result of a challenging economic environment and increased competitive activity. The EMEA region was down 6.4% for the quarter compared to 2011. During the quarter, we saw a significant softness in the Southern European countries and in the U.K. Northern Europe's retail sales continued to grow behind strength in Germany but at a slower rate than we've experienced in the last several quarters.","In addition to challenging retail conditions in Europe, our market share decreased slightly to 13.2% through May. During the quarter, Canada was up 1.8%. As we've discussed, international expansion is one of our core areas of investment for future growth. It is our objective to open 100 to 150 new international dealerships between 2009 and 2014. Since 2009, 74 incremental international dealerships have been opened, with roughly 2\/3 in emerging markets.","On Slide 13, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments during the quarter were up 25% compared to last year, as we depleted our company inventory in the U.S. in anticipation of our July second ERP launch and 2013 model year cutover. During the second quarter, Custom and Touring as a percent of total shipments were up versus prior year, and all categories were within their historical mix ranges. International shipments, as a percent of total, were down slightly compared to last year as we allocated more motorcycles to the U.S. market given the very strong first half or first quarter retail sales and tight retail inventory situation in the domestic market.","On Slide 14, you'll see revenue for Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up 17.1% in the second quarter, behind strong growth for motorcycle shipments. Parts and Accessory revenue was up 4.0% and General Merchandise revenue was up 3.1% in the quarter, as related businesses revenue generally tracks with worldwide retail motorcycle sales. Average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $410 compared to last year, largely as a result of unfavorable currency translation in the quarter. On average, our major foreign currencies devalued by approximately 8% between the second quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012.","Slide 15 is intended to provide a clear view of the change and impact of our restructuring activities as we enter into the home stretch of our restructuring. We are pleased to announce that the ERP launch started as planned on July 2. As of today, the ERP implementation is on plan, our employees are successfully working with the new system and are producing model year 2013 motorcycles. We will continue to work to increase efficiencies and maintain high-quality levels that we've experienced throughout the launch. We incurred approximately $9 million in temporary inefficiencies during the quarter as we continue to expect temporary inefficiencies in 2012 to be generally in line with 2011, which were $32 million. The expected ranges for the remaining quarters are noted on the slide.","Turning to the restructuring costs and savings on Slide 16. We incurred $6.2 million in restructuring expenses during the quarter. We are lowering our cost estimates by $10 million and now expect to spend $40 million to $50 million for the full year and $490 million to $510 million in total. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $315 million and $335 million upon completion of our restructuring activities. We are very pleased with our progress as we enter into the final stages of restructuring.","On Slide 17, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 35.9%, 0.9 percentage points higher than last year and slightly favorable to our expectations. During the quarter, gross margin percent benefited from lower manufacturing costs as a result of restructuring savings and incremental margin on higher production versus prior year. Gross margin also benefited from the model year 2012 pricing increase and lower raw material cost, which posted the first year-over-year improvement in 10 quarters.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted gross margin by $15.6 million, driven by the devaluation of most key currencies, partially offset by favorable hedge positions and the positive impact of lapping year-ago foreign currency losses. Over the next several quarters, we expect downward pressure on gross margin as a result of the devaluation we are experiencing in most key currencies. The adverse financial impact of devaluation will be somewhat tempered in the near-term by our currency hedges. We are very pleased with our gross margin performance during the first quarter and first half despite absorbing significant currency weakness. However, we continue to expect second half gross margin to be lower than the first half as a result of unfavorable currency exchange and production levels that are expected to be lower than the first half and below year-ago levels.","On Slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 19.7%, up 3.3 percentage points compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and favorable restructuring, partially offset by increased SG&A. SG&A was $248 million or 5.6% higher during the quarter compared to the second quarter last year. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A was up 10.6% driven by 3 factors. First and foremost, we continue to invest in our future growth. We believe there's great opportunity to grow our businesses worldwide, therefore, we are investing in our brand and our products, as well as the way we deliver the Harley-Davidson experience to our customers. Second, our first half SG&A expense included 6 additional days of spending compared to last year's fiscal calendar. This is a result of syncing up our fiscal calendar with a regular calendar. Conversely, the fourth quarter of this year will have 5 fewer calendar days compared to last year's fourth quarter.","Lastly, our Warranty and Recall expense was up versus the 6 months of last year, primarily driven by significantly higher motorcycle shipments. As a percent of revenue, SG&A continue to trend favorably to the first half of the year and was 1.2 percentage points lower than the same period last year at 17.1%. As we look forward, we expect third quarter SG&A to be up moderately versus prior year and down in the fourth quarter compared to last year's, resulting from the 5 fewer days in the quarter and as we lap the 2011 Q4 retail expense -- recall expense of $12 million. We continue to expect SG&A spending will increase on a year-over-year basis as we invest in growth, but will decrease as a percent of revenue.","Now moving onto the Financial Services segment on Slide 19. HDFS' operating profit decreased by $0.1 million compared to last year's second quarter. The key drivers of the second quarter results were: First, net interest income was up $2.6 million due to favorable borrowing costs, partially offset by lower revenue as our book of retail loans continues to contract reflecting lower motorcycle sales since the downturn; Second, the provision for retail credit losses was $0.7 million higher in the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to a $15.2 million 2011 credit loss reserve release versus $9.7 million 2012 release, partially offset by lower credit losses. And finally, the provision for wholesale credit losses was $2.6 million higher in the second quarter of 2012 behind increased wholesale receivables resulting from increased shipment to the dealer in the quarter.","We continue to believe that HDFS' operating profit will decrease in 2012 compared to 2011. We remain pleased with HDFS' performance and believe that it's critical for the sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products. Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 20. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the second quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 6.4% or $49.6 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by growth in used motorcycle loan originations and higher new motorcycle retail sales compared to last year, partially offset by 1 percentage point decrease in retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycle financing. Total finance receivables outstanding increased 0.4% compared to a year ago, driven by higher wholesale receivables due to higher shipments in the quarter.","HDFS is focused on prudently increasing credit application approval rates for near prime and sub-prime customers over the last several quarters. Our goal is to maintain a portfolio that continues to perform well over time and delivers an appropriate return on equity. We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which we'll see on Slide 21. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the second quarter 2012 was 2.68% or 85 basis points better than the same date last year.","Annualized retail credit losses are at their lowest level in over 10 years. For the first six months, retail credit losses came in at 58 basis points, considerably lower than prior year of 106 basis points. Credit loss performance was driven by our continued strong underwriting, collection and loss mitigation efforts, as well as consumer credit behavior in the U.S. While we continue to be disciplined in how we manage the loan portfolio and the overall business, we have no assurance that current consumer behavior will continue. At some point we expect shifting consumer behavior will temper the extremely strong credit performance we have experienced. We are pleased with the continued progress at HDFS. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. Now, let me turn it back to John.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 22. You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.21 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had $0.96 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $150 million. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Early in the third quarter, HDFS completed a $675 million asset-backed securitization transaction at a weighted average interest rate of 0.81%. Now I'd like to highlight one item on Slide 23, which provides the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials. The company provided operating cash of $288 million during the first six months compared to $473 million provided in 2011. The decrease in cash flows was primarily driven by an increase in HDFS wholesale lending activities driven by an over 20% increase in shipments during the period. The Motorcycle business generated operating cash of $220 million during the second quarter.","On Slide 24, you will see that for 2012, we continue to expect motorcycle shipments to be between 245,000 and 250,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up 5% to 7% from 2011. We continue to be committed to aggressively managing the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand. In the U.S., we expect our dealers to retail more units than they shipped in 2012, thereby lowering year-end retail inventories in the U.S. as we expect our flexible manufacturing capability at York will be up and running in the first half of next year.","During the third quarter, we expect to ship between 51,000 and 56,000 units, which is down 9% to 17%. We expect shipments to be down behind lowered production as a result of the downtime associated with the ERP implementation for our plan. As we have previously discussed, we also expect Q4 shipments and production to be down versus prior year because we expect to utilize flexible production in York in the first half of 2013. Consequently, we do not expect to produce and ship as many motorcycles in the fourth quarter to support spring sales. Also, this year will by lapping last year's excess inventory build of 7,000 motorcycles for the fourth quarter to support the ERP launch. And finally, this year there will be 5 fewer calendar days in Q4 compared to last year's fourth quarter, as we reset our corporate calendar.","We continue to expect full-year 2012 gross margin will be between 34.75% and 35.75%. We expect gross margin will be positively impacted by incremental restructuring savings, increased productivity from every day continuous improvement, motorcycle pricing and product mix. We believe that raw material costs, and temporary inefficiencies related to our restructuring activities will be comparable to 2011 levels. Currency is also expected to be unfavorable for the full year behind significantly weaker foreign currencies.","Finally, we continue to expect 2012 capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which includes approximately $35 million of capital related to restructuring.","As we look back on the second quarter of 2012, our overall results are in line with our expectations. Retail sales growth moderated, but we gained share in the U.S., reinforcing brand strength and product appeal. Despite a negative impact from foreign currency exchange during the quarter, gross margin percentage was up over last year. HDFS continues to perform well as we experience incredibly strong loss performance. Also during the quarter, we repurchased over 3 million shares of our stock. Today, we are thrilled that our ERP launch in York is on plan. It's a huge step in our progress towards transforming to world-class manufacturing.","We remain focused on executing against our strategies as we complete our final activities and our manufacturing restructuring, continue to transform our organization and grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Keith and John, you mentioned that the year-to-date retail sales are a little bit ahead of your expectations, yet clearly they were slowing during the second quarter. And yet you did not change your annual guidance for shipments. Could you just maybe comment on your comfort level with the U.S. channel inventories, in prior 2, you'd commented that those were a little bit low, and you said you kept more in the U.S. versus international this quarter due to that fact. So just in light of all that, comment where U.S. channel inventories are, and in light of your cautionary comments also looking forward with retail.","John A. Olin","Okay, Tim. First start with overall retail sales. We're very pleased with retail sales growth in the first half of 2012, but we do remain cautious on the U.S. economic recovery. As we expected in the second quarter, retail sales moderated from the first quarter levels and they did. Our dealer sales were up 12% despite the slow economic growth in the U.S. We gained 2.3 points of market share, which we feel great about as well. And finally, sales to outreach customers outpaced that of our core customers, which is one of our core objectives. So we're feeling very good about the first half. Again, cautious on the second half as we move into some more uncertain economic times. But when we look at the overall channel inventories, as we have been discussing, we shipped out as much as we could into the second quarter, which were all the model year 2012 motorcycles that we had in inventory in the U.S. That pushed our quarter-end retail inventories in the field, up about 6,800 units. And we're looking for that to bridge us to when we shipped the new model year 2013 product, which is the time of the dealer show in about the 3rd week of August. So what we believe is that given the fact that production was down after that and we've got such above 7 weeks until we ship again, is that we expect third quarter inventories to be below year-ago levels, even though they're starting out on a 6,800 units higher, we would expect them to dip below year-ago levels until we start replenishing with the model year 2013 motorcycles. The good news is that our dealers and customers typically experience this model year cutover at the same point during this year. Just a little bit longer of a bridge.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So in general then, John, in light of all that, are you guys comfortable with the U.S. channel inventories at this level? And given everything you know at this point about the trajectory of retail, would you term them a little bit still under ideal levels where you would want? And again, I know that surge is coming for next spring, but just in the context of everything.","John A. Olin","Yes, we would still characterize them as a little bit under where we would like them to be. Certainly, we exited the first quarter very light. The second quarter again, we built it up, but that's going to deplete very quickly, and we would like to add a little bit more in the third quarter as well. As we've discussed, though, we feel -- I'm very comfortable with the third quarter, and actually, expect those to come down a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just following up on a topic from your analyst meeting in New York. Do you expect the year-end dealer inventory to fall in 2013, next year?","John A. Olin","Yes. Yes, so let's take a look at overall -- our objective is pretty simple: We want to produce and deliver our products that customer\u2019s want, when they want them and where they want them. And so what we're doing is changing historical patterns that we've seen up in the past when we're at level production. So as we gain a capability that produce more when customers want them, we then have the ability to produce less when customers don't want them. And that's what the previous question was all about. It's in the fourth quarter, we would expect those inventories to be down this year, because now for products produced at our York facility, we'll be able to do more in the springtime when the customers are looking for them, so we don't need as much inventory to sit in the dealer network in December. Now when we look at 2013, the same thing is going to happen. It's just that, that capability of flexible manufacturing or our ability to surge production at Kansas City takes place in the first half of 2014. Whereas the exact same reason is we don't need to make as many new products out of Kansas City and put them in dealer inventory in the fourth quarter, because we'll now be able to do it in the spring selling season. So, yes, we would expect both the fourth quarter retail inventory to be down slightly in 2013 and 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just have a few questions. I think first on the ERP implementation. Can you help us understand how that might impact the mix of bikes that you're shipping this quarter? And then secondarily, given what's going on in Europe there may be some more global uncertainty, how are you can kind of thinking about your potential for price in the 2013 models?","John A. Olin","The ERP, again, we couldn't be more pleased with the ERP launch. Everything is on plan. We feel great about where we're at. Having said that, we are producing all models on a single combined line using the new system. So we don't expect any big changes or dramatic changes to the mix that our customers want in the third quarter. I think the next question, Sharon, was with regards to 2013 pricing. We don't provide anything on 2013 or the next model year pricing until we deliver it to our dealers. So what we will do is announce pricing of our motorcycles in the U.S. and around the world on August 20 at our worldwide dealer meeting here in Milwaukee.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on that. Given the currency pressure, can you help us understand kind of where you're coming out on currency versus raw materials as you look forward? Because I would expect perhaps raw materials are partial offset at least to the currency pressure.","John A. Olin","Okay. Well let's talk about currency first. During the quarter, it's certainly a tough quarter when we look at foreign currency. If you look at a year-ago second quarter versus this on quarter, it devalued by 8%. The euro was down 11%, I think, and the real was down 19% over that period of time. That had a very unfavorable impact on revenue of about $33.2 million. Some of our hedging activities, we got about $18 million of it back, so for the quarter, it was unfavorable by $15.6 million. So that was certainly more than we had anticipated and the foreign currencies within the quarter devalued by 3%. So very unfavorable, however, we did see some favorability in our raw materials. First time in 10 quarters that we've seen the year-over-year improvement in raw materials, and certainly, they came in pretty strong at $4.7 million. Of that, most of that was metals about $4.2 million metals and the other was fuel. So in the third and the second quarter, the 2 certainly did not offset one another. As we look forward, overall raw materials we expect to be flat on a year-over-year basis, but we are seeing a pretty good trend or a pretty good number here in the second quarter. Currency, we are pretty certain that it is going to be unfavorable as we move forward. So when we look at the third quarter, the euro a year ago was at $1.42 exchange rate and as we close the markets yesterday, it was at $1.23, and that's a 14% difference between quarters. So we would expect pressure on revenue from foreign currency exchange, and that will be somewhat mitigated by some of our hedges. But we would expect currency to be unfavorable in the third and fourth quarters. So we do not expect that raw materials can cover what we're seeing in currency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question on the gross margin. It sounds like your expectations for mix has shifted more positively from last quarters. Is that accurate? And if so was that a driver of kind of some positive earnings in the gross margin in the second quarter? And then can you also speak to why the mix is -- mix might be moving more positive?","John A. Olin","Well, yes. So last quarter, we were expecting mix to be slightly unfavorable, because as we took our volumes, most of that was coming out of Kansas City, which typically has a lower mix. But as we got through this quarter and everything is going so well on the ERP implementation, in the prior question, we're able to build all the products that we are looking for out of York, the proper mix of product that we now feel that our product mix will be slightly favorable as we end the year. So through the first half, mix is largely flat, up by $0.5 million, was up $1 million in the second quarter, but we would expect it to be somewhat favorable as we end the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions. I guess you said that inventory was not quite where you wanted it to be. You ended up year-on-year this past quarter, but you were going to deplete it obviously, a lot of that is what happened through August. Can you just maybe tell us what -- how the September quarter or the September period is tracking? Are you fully up to levels where you're able to produce at the volumes that you want to, or there are still remaining testing measures that need to be taken at York just as a final stage before you really get up to volumes that you would like to be at?","John A. Olin","The York ERP implementation, we said at the last conference call that we've started on July 2 and it would largely be behind us as we exited the month of July, and I'm happy to say that we're there. So we had a wrap of a grand plan that had us returning the pre-ERP implementation line speeds in just 4 weeks. And that's at the end of this week. And so, right now, we're exactly where we want to be on plan and over the next couple of shifts, we will be producing at pre-ERP launch line rates. So there is not an issue in terms of production coming out of York at all with regards to overall inventory or mix.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So basically, I mean, the drawdown was exactly as expected, it's just that you would have liked to have gone into the quarter maybe with just a little bit more padding?","John A. Olin","Yes. As you know, and again, it kind of goes back to the fact that retail sales are over -- or exceeded our expectations for the first half. So originally, we would have expected a little bit more going in, in retail inventory, but we're up 6800 units, and that will have to do over the next several weeks until we launch the new product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could just be a little bit more explicit on what you expect for the rest of this year for FX based on where your hedges are at, assuming spot rates stay where they are now, and if they did stay where they are now, what would be the headwind for 2013?","John A. Olin","Rod, we don't provide a forward look at currency, and the reason is there are so many factors that come in. There's so many currencies that play, that compared to year ago movements within the quarter mix of products and sales. So we don't provide that if we're here, this is where we're going to end up. But suffice to say that revenue is going to be impacted quite significantly if rates stay where they're at in the third and the fourth quarter. We do have hedges on, that were put on over the last 4 quarters. So those are put on at more favorable rates than we're experiencing right now. And that will mitigate some of the impact that we're seeing in revenue. But overall, we expect both revenue and gross profit to be hurt by the currency exchange and the devaluation of the currencies that we have. But there are so many factors that came in, if I gave out a number, tomorrow, it would be wrong.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then maybe if you could just comment on your -- the production guidance for Q4 looks like it's slightly lower than Q3 despite the ERP implementation issues in the third quarter. Is there some aspect of this that's rolling into the fourth quarter, or are you just looking to keep production pretty close to where sales are coming in this year?","John A. Olin","Well, we're looking to match our customer demand. So we have firepower in the fourth quarter to produce more. But production will be down versus year-ago levels because of the fact that now we can produce them in the first half closer to demand, and we much rather do that than produce them and put them in inventory in the fourth quarter. The other things that are going to have production down year-over-year is the fact that, again, a year ago, we were building excess inventory for the ERP launch, and we've got 5 fewer days for production. So we do have the capability to produce more product out of both Kansas City and York in the fourth quarter. But at this time, we feel comfortable with our estimate of shipments being up 5% to 7% and taking inventories down in the fourth quarter and moving that production to the first half of next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","You mentioned that there was some demand pulled forward into the first quarter due to the weather that seems to make all the sense in the world. I don't think that anybody thought that the 20% first quarter growth was remotely sustainable. I guess my question is when you look at the third -- I'm sorry, the 3% growth rate in 2Q, if we were to strip away any of that weather impact, I know that's hard to do, but do you think that the underlying momentum of your business is any better than that, or do you think that, that's about the run rate we should expect going forward?","John A. Olin","James, there is absolutely no way for us to tell how much sales was pulled forward. There's certainly every indication that a fair amount was pulled into the first quarter, with the first quarter weather, I think, although the third quarter was the best in 100 years. But we would not speculate on the split between what the quarter should have been. What we do know is that the first half was up 12%, and we feel very good about that, especially given the soft economic environment in the United States, and we're up 9.3% on a worldwide basis. And again, that's done in an environment that we've got a deepening recession in Europe. So we feel very good about overall first half, but there is absolutely no way, and we don't know how many were in the first quarter versus second quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Let me ask the question this way. I mean given your guidance for the back half of the year, it's hard to ask the question, because I know you guys don't want to give any retail guidance. But built into that lower production guidance for the back half, are you assuming a retail that's generally about where we are right now?","John A. Olin","I can't provide that. That would be giving retail guidance, James. We feel good about our shipment guidance of 5% to 7%. If retail sales are awarded, we can produce a little bit more in the fourth quarter, but at this point, our preference would be to make it closer to the customers' demands in the spring of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just kind of looking at the retail inventory levels for 2013, I know you'd like to bring those down by design, which is favorable, make the supply chain more efficient. Let's say retail demand is robust, what level of production can you achieve though, given the Kansas City facility switchover? Can you really kind of step up demand if you need to, or are you constrained by supply?","John A. Olin","I'm sorry, that was in 2013?","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I'm thinking -- looking at 2013 and '14.","John A. Olin","As we've discussed, we'll be able to surge capacity in York in the first half, and we feel comfortable with meeting any demand out of our York facility. With Kansas City, Kansas City capacity is not an issue in the short-term. We want to do is to be able to make units closer to customer demand, so we will not experience the same type of capacity constraints at our Kansas City facility as we did in York. Remember York was completely transformed, everything was moved down to a single line. We don't have those same things happening at Kansas City, and again, overall, we have plenty of capacity at Kansas City. But what we want to do is better utilize and more efficiently make units out of Kansas City, and again, using the surge capability to get closer to customer demand. So overall, in 2013, we do not have any -- we don't foresee any capacity constraints.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS Securities.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a question on your gross margin guidance, because you originally said you thought Q2 will be in line with Q1, and then kind of in late June at your analyst day, you said it would fall below Q1 levels. And it seems like last minute, it came in, in line. And I don't know if you can give us any color on that, if that was just some last-minute shipment mix that shifted that, or FX not being negative an impact? Did you saw it, or kind of what was of such a last-minute nature to change gross margin? And then I don't know if -- you would normally give out a comment about used bike prices or recall values or something, and you didn't comment on used bike prices, I don't know if you have any color there to share.","John A. Olin","Okay, Robin, with regards to the gross margin, yes, gross margin came in a little bit higher than we expected in the second quarter, which we're very pleased with. There's nothing that happened at the last minute. And we didn't -- or don't update guidance between and within the quarter. But what happened is, in why we came in a little bit more favorable to what we had anticipated, is largely driven by raw materials. Raw materials were $4.7 million favorable. In the first quarter, they were unfavorable by, I believe, it was $1.6 million or in that neighborhood. So that was really what pushed us over where we thought we would be, which again was below the first quarter gross margin, which was 35.9%, again, we came in even and certainly pleased with that. With regards to used bikes. So used bikes over the last 3 quarters, the gap, or the pricing gap between new and used, or the value gap, has remained very constant. As we have discussed in the fourth quarter of 2011, it was really the inflection point where we saw new grow faster than used, and that was after a period of many quarters where used was growing faster than new. And we have kept that for the last 3 quarters, as new has grown slightly faster than our used bike sales over the last 3 quarters. And we really take that to mean that the gap between new and used is at probably where it's going to be going into the future. We can grow both new and used bikes at the price levels that we have, so we feel pretty comfortable, and we do not expect huge movements in the price gap between new and used moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Katz with MorningStar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys maybe offer us some insight on how kind of European demand was overall, because it's a little bit hard to parse out currency versus price per unit of the bike, and I'm curious if maybe the promotional cadence had updated or there were some additional incentives to get units out the door over there?","John A. Olin","Jamie, there was no price discounts going on in Europe. When we look at the overall price per bike that we've mentioned, $410 of that was driven by currency. There was a little bit of offset because of the favorable pricing that we took a year ago, but that is currency. And again, that's the 8% devaluation across all our international currencies. When we look specifically at Europe, Europe held up very well last year. Actually Europe, our core sales in Europe were up over 5% last year, and we saw a little bit of weakness in the first quarter, and that certainly continued into the second quarter. I think we're down 3.1% in the first quarter and down 9.1%. And what's really happening in Europe is a kind of a tale of 2 markets, the South started deep declines in the third quarter of 2011 and will start to lap those coming up in this quarter. And the North has largely been growing quite robustly. And over the last couple of quarters, we've seen the North, while still growing, fall a little bit. And really the story in Europe is with regards to the recession and consumer confidence, the financial crisis that's happening there. Again, we're going to focus on what we can control and continue to build the brand and the distribution network.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify something from your earlier comments. I think you'd indicated that dealer inventories would end lower in 2013 and 2014 just because of the seasonal change in your kind of production model. And I can understand the step down in '13 because you have the KC surge coming into effect, but why would there be an incremental change in 2014 as well?","John A. Olin","If I said that, I apologize. We expect inventory to be lower this year, 2012, because of our ability to surge capacity at York in 2013. We expect 2013 retail inventory to be down slightly given our ability to surge Kansas City production in 2014. I did not intend to make any comments with regards to retail inventory at the end of 2014. So if I did, I apologize. We expect to be down in 2013 and 2014.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just one more quick one if I could. Can you comment on your -- what you saw competitively in Japan that you flagged in your prepared remarks?","John A. Olin","Yes. Japan, one, is the economy is slow as well. But, two, there's more price competition in Japan, in particular, by Honda. So we lost a little bit of share in the second quarter, and the team is addressing that, but it was a little bit lower than we had anticipated. So we'll work through that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, any color you can give here on the channel inventories in Europe? You mentioned again that you tilted shipments in the second quarter to the U.S. because it was so strong, and then clearly you've cited a couple of Kansas cases what's going on in Europe, but any color you can give us on those channels inventories in Europe?","John A. Olin","Yes. We feel fine with the inventory in Europe, given the sales were down. So we did shift that production into the growing market, which is the U.S. in the second quarter. But remember, Europe inventory is handled a little bit different than in the U.S., that's somewhat we call a pipeline method. So every all dealers have kind of floor stack, and when they sell one, they get one out of the warehouse, which allows smaller dealerships utilize less working capital. That's been incredibly beneficial as we've seen the South volumes decline and the North accelerate. It allows us to get product where we want it, when we need it. So by moving a couple of thousand units out of that which has been in a consolidated warehouse, given their sales were lower in the United States, we don't have any concerns with that, and we feel very good about our inventories in Europe as well as in Asia and Latin America.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault, Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just actually wanted to ask one on HDFS. I think you had cited, I guess 2 questions. Number one, in terms of borrowing costs, I think you had said that borrowing costs were favorable this year, or this quarter, excuse me. What's the outlook for that? I mean is there anymore diversification in funding away from shorter term to medium-term notes that you need to do, and could that be a potential headwind from a borrowing cost perspective going forward? And then also, can you just give us the math on where reserves or provisions should end the year? I think it sounds like you took down provisions a little bit as well this quarter, if I heard that correctly.","John A. Olin","Okay. Patrick, I'll take the first part of the question, then I'll let Larry answer the second. We're very pleased with borrowing costs. As we discussed, we're adjusting the market and did a securitization for $675 million at 0.81%. And in the first quarter, we run the medium-term note market and did the lowest MTN for a five-year period that we've ever done at 2.7%. So we feel fantastic about our borrowing cost. To answer your question with regards to diversification, we also feel very comfortable where we're at today. As you may all recall, is that -- over the last couple of years, we've been looking to more diversify our funding move more into a more balanced approach between term notes as well as the securitization and CP. So we feel great about where we're at in terms of the overall diversification. We're not looking to make any major changes. So that should not have an impact on borrowing cost as we go forward. I'll let Larry answer the second question.","Lawrence G. Hund","Sure, thanks, John. Regarding the allowance, we had an allowance at the beginning of the period of $122.5 million, our provision for the quarter was actually a credit of $5.3 million. That was driven, as John said, by the allowance release of $9.7 million in our retail portfolio. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $3 million, and that left us with a provision at the end of the quarter of $114.2 million. We are not going to give any guidance regarding where we expect to end the year regarding our allowance or what provisions in the third or fourth quarter. I'll just continue to reinforce my remarks, which were credit conditions remain favorable right now. I think we've done a lot of good things in underwriting, but also there's some unfavorable consumer behavior trends, which are driving our relatively low delinquency and loss levels at the present time.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Without discussing anything real specific to front run yourself at the dealer day, but what level of innovation do you expect, or are you planning to maybe hit different demographics or different segments, or is it just going to be kind of really innovative new products? What -- maybe some color versus even historical levels of innovations coming out of your new products would be helpful?","John A. Olin","Greg, we're not going to provide any look to what you might see in the next couple of weeks at the dealer show. What I would say broadly is we're making great progress on our product development transformation and the ability to move product through there quicker and to better target product toward our outreach groups in the U.S. and around the world. And as we've said before, we would expect to start to see kind of the fruits of that restructuring and transformation in next year's product, model year '14 product. But with regards to this model year, I'm not going to provide anything. We'll have it out in about 4 weeks here, or 3 weeks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue.

Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, our President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin, will be hosting the call. Matt, let's get started.","Matthew Levatich","Thank you, Amy and good morning everyone. And thanks for joining us on the call today. Before John digs into the details for the quarter, I'd like to provide my perspective on our performance along with further insight on our long term strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally.","Overall, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations with the exception of our Asia-Pacific region. We're very pleased with the continued strong global response to our Milwaukee-Eight powered touring motorcycles, our recently introduced Road King Special and Street Rod Motorcycles and our actions to improve our retail inventory position ahead of the U.S. peak riding season.","As we anticipated, our U.S. retail sales were down behind a soft market, yet our share held strong despite our decision to limit availability of Model Year 2017 motorcycles. This decision helped dealers focus on selling down model year 2016 bikes. While we believe this holdback of hot product had a negative impact on our retail sales in the U.S., we could not be more pleased with our U.S. retail inventory position and our market share strength.","International retail sales were down primarily behind softer-than-expected sales within Asia Pacific. We expect some continued challenges in Asia Pacific, but we anticipate the region will return to growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we're confident in our full year plan, including the work we have underway to offset unexpected softness in a few key markets.","Now as most of you know, earlier this year, we shared our 10-year strategy with the headline goal of building the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders around the world. Now more than ever, our business focus goes beyond our commitment to building unmatched, unmistakable motorcycles, accessories and apparel. We're committed to building riders. We have a clear path with long term objectives and focused strategies. By 2027, our objectives are to build 2 million new Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S., grow our International business to 50% of our annual volume, launch 100 new high-impact Harley-Davidson motorcycles, deliver superior return on invested capital for Harley-Davidson Motor Company and grow our business without growing our environmental impact.","In the U.S., we must attract more new riders to this sport. As the clear market leader, we have an obligation and opportunity to invest to secure the long term vitality of our sport. We believe building 2 million new Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S. over the next 10 years is an ambitious yet achievable goal, one that we find incredibly inspiring and motivating. We don't think it will be easy and we don't expect the results will be linear. I'm sure sometimes even quarter-to quarter market volatility may buffet confidence in our results. But true north is true north. We'll leverage our assets, build on key capabilities, nail the fundamentals and lean into what we already know about engaging new kinds of people in all we love about our sport.","One key pathway is the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy. We're increasing our investment and already through March of this year our dealers have trained more than 8,800 students, a 10% increase from the first quarter of last year. The increase was fueled by growth in the number of dealers offering Harley-Davidson Riding Academy and more classes being offered through existing dealers.","We'll continue to hone our ability to inspire all kinds of riders, whether new, seasoned or returning. Harley-Davidson has never been about 1 demographic or set of riders. We're about every freedom-seeking soul who wants to live for real and we've proven it with our success since we began our outreach efforts.","We know that between 2010 and 2016, sales of new Harley-Davidson Motorcycles to outreach customers in the U.S. grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5%. And our mix of retail sales to outreach customers grew from 34% to 40% over the same period. We lead in the sale of motorcycles in every outreach segment and we expect to build on our capabilities to further our lead. We know from IHS market in 2016, for the ninth straight year, Harley-Davidson was the #1 seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to outreach as well as to our very loyal core customers. And as part of our approach to building the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, whether we're talking of racing enthusiasts, members of the military or youth, women or experienced riders in the U.S. or in 1 of the 96 other countries where we have great dealers, we intend to continue to increase the relevance of the brand and sport through alignment and precision in all of our efforts, beginning with our deep connection to riders.","We know what they seek in products, experiences and the expertise of our dealers. We know what technical gear is necessary to make their rides safer, drier, warmer and cooler. We know what motorcycle accessories they want to dial up a bike's look, sound and feel. We aim to inspire all kinds of riders the world over with focus and discipline. The backbone of it all is great motorcycles and as I mentioned earlier, we launched 2 new high-impact motorcycles this quarter, 2 down, 98 to go. The Road King Special delivers unparalleled style and attitude, powered by the great Milwaukee-Eight engine. And for more of a city dweller, we unveiled the new Street Rod, tuned for dynamic urban performance. The Street Rod is designed with a high output Revolution X 750 engine and refined chassis, suspension and brakes to deliver more power and nimble handling, ideal for taking on less-forgiving city streets.","The Street Rod is fast, sleek and tough. The raw authentic dark custom look is already gaining attention around the world and at a great price point too.","As part of our goal to increase reach and impact internationally, in the quarter we added 7 locations in China, India, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Thailand. As you heard us say, we plan to add 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020 alone and we're already well on our way. As we forge ahead with our international reach, it's great to pause and take note of a couple of incredible milestones. 2017 marks the 100th year of Harley-Davidson sales in both Canada and Australia. They now join the Centennial Club that also includes the U.S., England, Japan and Mexico.","All I've shared here today is just a sampling of us working our long term plan. These are investments to deliver the near term results that drive long term performance and value for all of our stakeholders. We're confident our investments will grow ridership, reach, impact and share and profit. We've set high expectations for ourselves over the next 10 years. Building the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders is a long term play with long term value and results will not happen overnight. We have plenty more work to do, executing and delivering our plan. We're confident our focus strategy, powerful brand and commitment to excellence position us well for the challenges of today's dynamic marketplace. We're here to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, ignite their dreams of personal freedom, however they define it and we're on it.","So with that, I'll have John go through the detail on the first quarter. Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our first quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. As Matt stated, our first quarter was adversely impacted by our decision to significantly reduce our Q1 shipments compared to last year. We did this to help enable U.S. dealers to sell through the model year 2016 motorcycles that were in retail inventory at the end of 2016. This action was significant -- this action significantly limited our model year 2017 motorcycle availability in the quarter, in particular, our Milwaukee-Eight powered bikes. As planned, quarter-end retail inventory was significantly lower year-over-year and the mix of model year 2017 to model year 2016 motorcycles improved.","We believe the financial impact of this decision will move profit out of Q1 and into the back half of the year, basically retiming shipments and gross margin percent. We're pleased with the execution and results of this action and believe the current level and model year mix of U.S. dealer inventory has well-positioned Harley-Davidson for the spring selling season.","The summary of first quarter results starts on Slide 12. During the quarter, revenue was $1.50 billion, net income was $184.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.05. Operating income in the Motorcycles segment was down 28.2% from last year. Revenue was down 15.7% from last year's first quarter behind a 14.7% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus the prior year quarter on unfavorable mix and manufacturing expense. Timing of SG&A spend resulted in significantly lower SG&A during the year's first quarter and operating margin as a percent of revenue decreased by 3.1 percentage points.","At HDFS, operating income in the first quarter was down 6.6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took important actions to set the business up for future growth, underscoring our commitment to perform in a much more competitive and dynamic marketplace. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.","Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q1 are summarized on Slide 13. Q1 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 4.2% versus prior year. As expected, U.S. retail sales were down compared to last year's first quarter. Our U.S. business is on target to deliver our plan. International results, however, came in below our expectations, driven by weak sales in the Asia-Pacific region. The global competitive environment remains intense. Our teams around the world are adapting to changing market conditions and are poised to grow our business. We continue to work hard to protect and reinforce the strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. We expect worldwide retail sales growth for the remainder of the year will be driven by, improved availability of Milwaukee-Eight powered bikes and the introduction of our model year 2018 motorcycles; strong execution of our U.S. ridership growth initiatives; expansion of our international dealer network; and easing of year-over-year sales comps in both the U.S. and international markets. We remain confident in our full year motorcycle shipment guidance.","Let's take a closer look at the U.S. on Slide 14. In the U.S., retail sales were down versus prior year as we anticipated. U.S. retail sales were adversely impacted by weak industry sales and limited availability of model year 2017 motorcycles, partially offset by strong sales of our Milwaukee-Eight touring bikes and our focus on growing ridership. We believe the U.S. industry continues to be adversely affected by soft used bike prices and weakness in the oil-dependent areas and we continue to expect the industry will remain soft for the full year. However, comps are easier starting in Q2 as we lap the initial industry declines that started in the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year market share growth continued in the quarter despite facing significant industry headwinds.","During the quarter, we expected lower year-over-year U.S. retail sales and stable market share. The quarter largely unfolded as we anticipated, in spite of the unexpected liquidation of Victory Motorcycles. The Victory wind-down benefited industry performance in Q1 and negatively impacted our market share. We expect this impact to continue through the second quarter and largely reverse in the back half of this year when the remaining Victory inventory is liquidated.","Again, our decision to limit availability of model year 2017 motorcycles, in particular, Milwaukee-Eight bikes, helped focus U.S. dealers on selling model year 2016 bikes and achieve an improved inventory mix prior to the selling season. It also resulted in quarter-end retail inventory being down approximately 8,200 motorcycles versus prior year. However, we also believe the constrained supply of model year 2017 bikes negatively impacted our retail sales and market share for the quarter. As we look forward to the end of the second quarter, we expect year-over-year U.S. dealer retail inventory to continue to remain lower than prior year to support the appropriate -- an appropriate model year transition. We continue to expect 2017 year-end U.S. retail inventory to be essentially flat to 2016 as we remain committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand.","We're pleased with -- we're pleased that the U.S. is on plan after the first quarter. We're looking forward to the spring selling season and are excited about creating the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, improving the availability of Milwaukee-Eight powered bikes and introducing our model year 2018 motorcycles.","On Slide 15, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 1.8%. First quarter retail sales were below our expectations driven by weak sales in Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in Latin America. While EMEA and Canada were both down during the quarter, we believe that the underlying business fundamentals in these markets remain strong. More specifically, EMEA retail sales were down 0.4% during the quarter as we lap very strong prior year growth of 8.8%. We believe underlying demand remains healthy, especially for the S Model motorcycles and the new Milwaukee-Eight powered bikes. Market share in Europe through February was 10.0%, up 0.3 percentage points from prior year. The industry was down 8.5% during the same period.","In Asia-Pacific, Q1 retail sales were down 9.3% from last year. Sales were adversely impacted by softness in our emerging markets and in Japan. India sales continue to be down in the high double digits due in large part to the continued impact of last quarter's demonetization. Japan was down behind soft industry results. However, we increased our #1 market share position by nearly 2 percentage points in the quarter.","We expect our Asia-Pacific region to return to growth in the back half of 2017, largely behind expanded distribution, the introduction of the new Street Rod and increased marketing spending for the remainder of the year. Retail sales in Latin America were up 24.2% in Q1 compared to a year-ago decline of 26.5%. During the quarter, we saw significant strength in Brazil where we lapped the impact of prior year price increases. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 4.4% as we lapped very strong prior year growth of 16.3%. In support of our strategy to increase brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. As Matt noted, in the first quarter, we opened 7 new international dealerships.","On Slide 16, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments were down 14.7% in the quarter and within our shipment guidance range. As we have discussed, we significantly reduced Q1 shipments versus prior year, predominantly touring motorcycles, to support the sell-through of model year 2016 motorcycles in the U.S. retail inventory.","On Slide 17, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was down in the first quarter behind lower year-over-year motorcycle shipments. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was down $342 for the quarter as we shipped fewer touring bikes, partially offset by the impact of higher pricing. Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise revenues were down for the quarter due in large part to lower motorcycle shipments and lower retail motorcycle sales.","Our gross margin review is on Slide 18. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was down during the quarter driven by unfavorable product mix and higher manufacturing expense, partially offset by increased pricing and favorable foreign currency exchange. Mix was unfavorable during the quarter as we shipped a significantly lower mix of touring motorcycles compared to last year. Gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by $10.3 million of higher manufacturing expense. Q1's manufacturing expense was up due to the timing of fixed cost absorption and higher depreciation which was partially offset by strong productivity. First quarter startup costs were flat to prior year.","Currency exchange was favorable for the quarter despite U.S. dollar strengthening slightly against our key foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis. The favorability was driven by positive balance sheet remeasurement at the end of the quarter. To dimensionalize foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at current levels for the remainder of 2017, we estimate that our expected full year motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 0.75% and our gross margin would be approximately flat to down $10 million. We were very pleased with our first quarter gross margin performance, which exceeded our expectations by a full percentage point. We expect to recover a portion of Q1's mix unfavorability in Q2 and the majority of the first quarter's loss absorption in Q4.","On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q1 was 18.0%, down compared to last year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A. First quarter SG&A was $19.1 million lower than prior year, primarily due to timing of marketing and engineering spending. We continue to expect full year SG&A spending to be approximately in line with 2016 SG&A. Profitability remains a key focus and we believe we can further leverage our established capabilities to continue to drive profit and strong ROIC in the future.","Moving on to HDFS on Slide 20. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit decreased $3.7 million or 6.6% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting Q1 results were, first, net interest income was up over prior year by $0.8 million. Second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $6.6 million driven by higher retail credit losses and an associated increase in the allowance. ","HDFS' operational results are on Slide 21. For the quarter, originations were up 3.8% compared to last year. HDFS' strong market share gains of 6.1 percentage points, 62.9%, reflect the finance offers that supported the sell-through of certain 2016 models through the end of February. During the quarter, we raised $500 million of funding through the issuance of 2 medium term notes.","At the end of the quarter, we had $360.3 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.09 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.","On Slide 22, you'll see 30-day delinquency rate for the motorcycle loan receivables on the balance sheet at the end of February was 3.17% or 29 basis points higher than Q1 of 2016. 8 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of the portfolio after Q2 2016 full securitization of prime receivables. Consistent with the vehicle financing industry trends, the increase on a managed basis was due to higher delinquencies across the portfolio. The annual retail credit loss rate for receivables on balance sheet was 2.31% or 33 basis points higher than Q1 2016. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 2.25%. The increase was due to higher defaults across the portfolio.","While both 30-day delinquencies and credit losses were up in the quarter, the rate of increase of both has tempered from last year's run rates. HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company, as demonstrated by the $106 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. in January.","The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 23. A few things to note. Operating cash flow was up from last year driven by low financing, partially offset by low net income. And the full year tax rate was 34.5%, the same rate as in Q1 of 2016. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","Turning to Slide 24, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We're committed to driving motor company ROIC, which is in the top quartile of the S&P 500 through the disciplined investments that we make and invest in class ROE at HDFS. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $70.9 million. We also increased our dividend by 4.3% to $0.365 per share in the quarter. We will continue to look for opportunities to deliver shareholder value by investing to maximize the long term value of the company and the brand and by returning excess cash to our shareholders.","On Slide 25, you'll see our full year expectations for 2017 remain unchanged. In the second quarter, we expect shipments to be approximately 80,000 to 85,000 motorcycles which is down approximately 4% to 9% compared to last year, driven by our commitment to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. We expect to end Q2 with retail inventory that is considerably lower than prior year to prepare the dealer network for the new model year transition.","HDFS' operating income in Q2 will be down as we lap last year's gain on the full securitization of $9.3 million and as we expect higher provision for retail credit losses.","Overall, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year shipment and earnings guidance. We're extremely pleased with the incredible response to the new model year 2017 motorcycles which demonstrates our product innovation leadership and reinforces our strategy to invest in high-impacting products. We're on the right path, are disciplined in the execution of our strategies, and continue to make the necessary decisions to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future.","Through disciplined and focused investments, we plan to build the next generation of riders globally and deliver strong returns to our investors and sustain the company for the long term.","With that, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","I have a couple of questions. First on the finance business. I guess, one, could you give any color on the market share increase you saw on the quarter because that seems pretty high. And then secondarily, I appreciate your lapping the securitization, but ex the securitization, do you expect there to be continued pressure in the back half of the year on HDFS income?","John Olin","Thanks, Sharon. First question is with regards to HDFS' market share. They ended market share of 63%, which was up about 6 percentage points versus prior year. A lot of this was driven by the financing that the company did in January and February. In January and February, we offered incentives on model year '16 motorcycles only, Touring, trike, and our CVO models, which were the most highest inventory position at that time, to help our dealers sell through those motorcycles. In addition, we constrained our limited availability of 2017s, but the financing also helped pull that through. And with that, we gained a fair amount of market share during the quarter.","We believe that will not be with us. It was just a function of the strong financing that we offered. The second question, Sharon, you asked is in the second quarter, certainly we will lap the $9.3 million full securitization that we don't expect to repeat in the second quarter. The question is, what do we expect the back half of HDFS to be. We expect the back half of HDFS to be stronger given the fact that we will lap a fair amount of reserves that were set up in the back half of the year. Overall, HDFS on a full year basis, we expect it to be down largely driven by lapping that $9.3 million full securitization. We do expect, however, on a full year basis that credit losses will be up and interest expense will be up. And for that, we\u2019ve looked to minimize that with price increases that we took in early January on the portfolio.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. And then, secondarily, on the retail side, are you seeing any stabilization in the oil regions? And any commentary on kind of what you're seeing with used bike prices would be helpful.","John Olin","Yes. So the answer is yes to both. But cautiously -- cautious, yes, on both. So we've talked about the industry as we move into 2017 being soft, driven by those 2 that you had mentioned, Sharon, used bike prices as well as oil-dependent regions. In the -- for Harley-Davidson, in oil-dependent regions in the first quarter, we're down about 5%, I think it was 5.2%. A little bit accelerated from what we saw in the fourth quarter, but significantly down from what we've seen over the past, I don't know, 6 quarters. We had been running in 2016 at 10% to 15% down in those -- retail sales down in those markets. So the first quarter is down 5.2. As we continue through the year, we would expect this to get -- or to narrow throughout the year. ","With regards to used bike pricing, the industry was down in the first quarter, down about -- the best of the data that we have, down about 1 to 1.5 percentage points. Harley-Davidson's used bike price is down a little bit more than that which we would expect given the innovation and the value that we added, in particular, with the Milwaukee-Eight engine. It also, for the industry, marks the ninth straight quarter that used bike prices were down. Now having said that, we did see some positive signs in the quarter, in particular, at auction. Overall, auctions while they started out -- prices started out the beginning of the quarter down versus prior year. They actually finished the quarter favorable to prior year. So as a data point of 1, we'll keep a close eye on it, but we're certainly pleased to see used bikes pricing at the auction firm up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush.","James Hardiman","Maybe if we could dig into the margin situation a bit. Sounds like margin -- gross margin, in particular, but maybe in SG&A significantly better in the first quarter, sounds like some of that was currency but that the guidance is unchanged for the year. So I guess, first, maybe help us quantify the currency benefit that you saw in the first quarter and then just explain sort of -- maybe the guidance isn't specific enough to change going forward, but it seems like the implication is that margin guidance for the remainder of the year might be a little bit worse. So help us sift through those -- those various data points.","John Olin","Great, James. I'd be happy to do that, and also happy to point out we still have 3 more quarters to go, but we're very pleased with gross margin in the first quarter. Coming out in January, we thought that gross margin would be down by 2.5 percentage points. And again, the reason for that is as we're taking a fair amount of shipments and production out of the first quarter and putting them in the back half of the year, ended up being 12,200 units lower in the first quarter that will move -- with that will move a fair amount of loss absorption. So we don't expect overall gross margin to change because of the volume. We just expect the profitability to change by quarter.","The other piece of that is we expect the first quarter to be down quite significantly because of mix as we constrain overall inventories of model year 2017s to generate that focus by the dealer network. We also shifted the mix because of the bigger problem in excess model year 2016s was Touring. So we saw that to be unfavorable. That will also come back more largely in the second quarter. Now having said that, we did end up favorable on the quarter by a full percentage point to our expectation. That was driven by 2 things, James, number one is the one that you'd mentioned, currency; and the other one was manufacturing expense. So starting with currency, we were expecting currency to be flat on a year-over-year basis to down a little bit or unfavorable a little bit.","And what we saw was, even though the dollar strengthened slightly against our basket of foreign currencies which was a negative to revenue, it was more than offset by the remeasurement of assets. And what we saw within the quarter was about a 4% strengthening of the U.S. dollar from the beginning of the quarter to the end and that's how we marked the -- remeasured the assets from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. So we're feeling a little bit better about currency.","Again, it's very volatile. We have a fair amount of hedges on for the remainder of the year. We still expect currency to be flat to down, but little bit more positive and it's certainly helped the quarter out. More importantly and more significantly, was manufacturing expense. It was down very high $10.3 million. All of that and then some was driven by the absorption that will get back in the back half of the year. Also unfavorable was depreciation expense which we expected because of the investments that we made over the last couple of years, largely in the Milwaukee-Eight, the retooling, and the ERP system. But where we're very excited in the first quarter was overall productivity came in higher than expected, so the plants are running well and overall we feel good about gross margin. And as you pointed out, James, we're not looking to change our guidance which is gross margin largely in line with prior year, but we're out of the gates and we feel pretty good about gross margin. We'll have to keep an eye on it.","You also mentioned SG&A. SG&A was favorable by $19 million. Our full year guidance is for SG&A to be largely flat to 2016. We still expect that to happen. SG&A is all timing in the first quarter. That $19.1 million was driven predominantly by marketing spending and some engineering spending. We had planned to move some of that spending out of the first quarter more into the third quarter. So we would expect the third quarter to be more unfavorable as we make up that timing, in particular, on marketing spending.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Luke Johnson","So you said, U.S. retail was down as anticipated. And I don't recall you conveying your anticipations to us. But you do say that U.S. is on target for your plan for the remainder of the year. So maybe you could share with us what your target is for the year and what you anticipate for 2Q?","John Olin","Thanks, Gerrick. Actually in January, we -- when we gave guidance for overall shipments which was flat to down modestly, we said that we expected the U.S. to be down [Technical Difficulty] made up by growth in the international markets. While we didn't break it out by quarter, we certainly expected the U.S. in the first quarter to be by far the toughest quarter out of the 4 quarters that we faced. And the reason for that, Gerrick, is very simple.","And when we look at industry growth and again, the industry was growing very well for a 5-year period of time at a CAGR of 3%, that ended in the second quarter of 2016, driven by soft bike prices. Certainly, the oil-dependent area weakness that we were seeing, consumer confidence and the like. That quarter was down 8.6% and we were down in the third quarter 6.3%, the industry, was and then 3.2%. If you average those 3 quarters, you get 6% lower industry. We expected the industry to continue to be down and cycle through a full 4 quarters and lo and behold, the industry was down about 6% in the first quarter.","So on a full year last 4 quarter basis, the industry has been down 6%. Now we expect that to get significantly better in terms of the industry over the next 3 quarters as we lap the very softness that we experienced and as previously, I think, that Sharon asked the question, as we start to see the oil-dependent areas firm up a bit as well as used bike prices.","Gerrick Luke Johnson","Okay. Do you have a plan for 2Q? Is your 2Q plan up 5, up 10? Or do you have a plan for the full year?","John Olin","Gerrick, let me tell you, we got a plan for Q2. We've got a plan for the next 5 years. Yes, we absolutely do. And we don't share our quarters publicly. But we certainly have a plan. We feel very good about that plan. We feel good about how we're set up and in particular, the inventory situation in the United States. We're incredibly competitive. When we look at market share in the United States and around the world, we had a fantastic first quarter with market share being up in the United States and Canada, in Japan, Australia and Europe. So now we've got a plan and we feel very good about that plan and what we wanted to do is convey to everyone is that coming out of the first quarter we were down. We read all the stuff that are published as well as far as the dealer surveys. They had the industry wrong. They had Harley-Davidson wrong. But we did not have it wrong. We're on plan as we move out of the first quarter with the exception of Asia Pacific.","Gerrick Luke Johnson","Okay. Congratulations for not blaming weather. I think that would have been an easy one for you to throw out there. And looks like, that gets a little better for you.","John Olin","We're hoping. We have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird.","Craig R. Kennison","Matt, I wanted to focus on your strategy to build more riders. I think you indicated that in the first quarter you saw a 10% increase in the number of riders trained. I believe last year you trained 65,000 riders. So what's the target for 2017 and what is the plan to improve conversion of that rider group?","Matthew Levatich","So, Craig, I'm going to focus on the second part of that equation. Our focus is on both the capacity and the capability of our Riding Academy. But as I said in my opening remarks, it is a pathway into the sport and one that we have to continue to enhance, because a trained rider doesn't necessarily build a rider. And this is all part of the strategy when we talk about embracing use and how we shift our mindset from rider training to rider learning and what does it mean when you're coming out of Riding Academy to gain the confidence necessary to become an avid rider.","So this is the focus of our emphasis and we have plans for Riding academy. We're pleased with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. But it is one component of the 10-year journey to build riders. It's an important component. It's an incredible asset that we have as a company, our dealer network, our training program, The Street motorcycle and we're doing a number of things within Riding Academy. But I think the more important thing is what we're doing beyond Riding Academy to inspire the next generation riders, get them trained properly and have them become riders. So thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital.","Joseph Spak","I guess, just at a high level, given the delayed shipments of the model year '17 and what looks like a very back-end loaded shipment year, what gives you the confidence that we won't run into basically the same issue next year as the model year '18s come out and that you are stuck with higher level of '17s?","John Olin","Thanks, Joe. Joe, from what you saw in the first quarter, we shipped in the United States about 12,000 less motorcycles. And when you look at our Q2 shipment guidance, we don't break it out by markets, but overall, we're expecting Q2 to be down in shipments anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 units. So the idea here is that we ended up with last year with significantly more excess product. So we're taking down the overall inventory throughout the first 3 quarters of the year and you saw that in the first quarter we were down 8,200 units and we expect to be down more than that when we finish the second quarter. That will limit the amount of product that's in the marketplace.","And so when we come out with the new model year, we will be significantly less potential for carryover inventory. The only part of the equation that's left is retail sales, but the magnitude of inventory that we're taking out, that we have taken out and that we will take out through the remainder of the second quarter will assure us that the inventory position coming out of or going into the next model year will be dramatically better than it was a year ago. Again, remember a year ago, things were going really well until that second quarter. And we certainly do not expect the industry to be down 6% on average for 3 quarters and that's what drove the excess inventory. We're going to start out from a much better position this year than we did last year.","Joseph Spak","So I know you don't typically do this, but help people get comfortable. I mean for inventory to be flat on a year-over-year basis, it would seem our back of the envelope math would -- it would suggest -- it would seem that retail has got to be about flat for the remaining 3 quarters. Is that -- can you confirm that?","John Olin","I'm sorry, Joe, you said flat? Flat over what period of time? I'm...","Joseph Spak","For the remainder of the year -- let's just say, the next 3 quarters. U.S. retail has got to be about flattish for you to sort of hit a flat shipment guide and inventories be stable year-over-year.","John Olin","So on a year-over-year basis, we expect inventories to be flat. We expect shipments to be flat to down modestly. So with those 2 -- with shipments being down flat to down modestly, we would expect given our read of what retail sales will be is that we will end the year with flat inventories on a year-over-year basis in the United States. And again, but prior to getting there, we would expect inventory to be down quite significantly in the 3 quarters prior to that and overall, tightening up of inventory.","When the industry is not growing and we haven't seen it grow now for 4 quarters, we want to be more conservative and more defensive on the inventory position and tighten things up to make sure that we maintain that premium brand. So we would expect inventories to be down at the end of the Q1, Q2 and Q3 and we're moving a lot of that shipments to the fourth quarter. And we'll have inventories at a year-over-year level basis and that will give us the trajectory that we need for 2018 to get over the selling season hump.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy Andrew Conder","Just 2 quick ones here, Matt, if you could just maybe expand on the rollout timing here of the rider learning programs. You covered some of those in the Analyst Day presentation. But just maybe the cadence of how we should start to see some of those rollout. And then, can you expand a little bit, John, on the programs that are out there to support the used bikes sales or prices? And are you doing anything with that as customers trade the bikes in?","John Olin","All right. I'll start out, Tim, with the second part of the question. Then Matt will answer your question on the rollout of rider training. So with regards to our part of removing the excess inventory, we're really doing 3 things. One we've talked a lot about in this call is we've significantly limited availability of model year '17s to put pressure and focus on model year '16s. And to that end when you look in United States, our shipments were down 30% in the fourth quarter and down 21% in the first quarter and we've seen inventories go from, at the end of the third quarter, plus 9,700 units to down 8,200 units. So we've been very successful in limiting the amount of inventory and garnering that focus.","So that's the first part. The second part is consumer activities. Now we talked a little bit about the financing. We did some low rate financing in January or February. There is none in the market at this time or since February, but that helped out. That was only offered on model year '16 Touring and trike and CVO. We also offer winter warranty for our customers to get them more willing to buy in the dead of winter versus waiting for spring because they don't lose any warranty coverage. Then the third aspect is with the dealers. And we've talked a little bit about this. We've helped the dealers on trades. And where we have pockets of model year '16s, we've helped facilitate trades between dealers to get them to places where they can sell.","Secondly, is we provided overall financial incentives for the dealers to help defray or to help their profitability out over that period of time. So those are the things that we've done. We feel very good about where we're at. And the dealer network did a fantastic job of reducing overall model year '16 inventories. We couldn't be more pleased. And with that, we've seen the percentage of new to used increase by about 30 percentage points from the beginning to the end of the quarter. Having said that, overall during the quarter, model year '17 bikes have been quite limited and down about 25% across the whole model. And then when you look at Touring, down a fair amount more than that. So they have been constrained. It worked and as we exit the quarter, we've now got a much better mix of '17s and again, well positioned for the selling season.","Matthew Levatich","Okay, Tim. So thanks for your question. I think the key idea here that I mentioned at the Investor Day was the entire enterprise shifting its mindset from we build motorcycles to we build riders. And everyone in the company and across the dealer network can say without pause how many motorcycles they sold that day or how many motorcycles as a company we built and shipped that day. What we need to be able to do and this is why this is a 10-year strategy, is to be able to talk about how many customers did we build today and who are those customers and where are they coming from and how embedded are they in our sport.","And so this is why -- I know there will be a call for lots of metrics in reporting and we will be working on ways that we talk about the things that we're doing to achieve that, but it starts with a mindset shift. And the mindset shift is already generated. Comments that I made this morning already and at the Investor Day about when you think about building riders, you think about the business differently and we're thinking about the role of Riding Academy differently. It's in the context of a lot of things that are necessary to create a rider. It is an important piece of that journey, but more needs to be added to that journey to build a confident, enthusiastic rider on the other side. So Craig's question earlier, the simple measure around increasing the capacity and the capability to Riding Academy is an important part of our strategy, there are a number of other things that we're doing and that are under developed -- development and will be developed over time to continue to move toward this point where we're building riders every day and people have the same clarity around how many riders we built, as they do today about how many motorcycles were sold.","So it's not -- I guess, the answer is, there's not a lot of specific what are we rolling out, what are the tactics and the actions. We'll clearly be talking more about that over time, but right now the focus is on getting everybody's mentality turning to shift to the idea we build riders and what does that mean for the work we have to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Just more on the topic of the Riders Academy, I can appreciate that you don't want to quantify this and get into that kind of discussion on a quarter-on quarter basis. But can you at least help us understand whether this conversion rate was up or down year-over-year. And then, secondly, just I'm guessing a lot of these Riders Academy graduates are drawn by the economics of buying a used bike. Can you talk about what you might be doing right now beyond Street Rod to create more excitement around the opening price points?","John Olin","Thanks, David. With regards to conversion rate, in 2016, it was down a bit. And several reasons for that. One is we offered a lot of it free. And we learned some things through that. And we had Heroes Ride Free program which provided that we would pay for military, police, fire and first responders. And one of the learnings is when you offer things free some people don't -- they go to have something to do, but so the conversion was down a touch last year and those, we're making adjustments for and some of the things that Matt talked about, to improve that conversion rate. And we're learning that it's really people moving out of the class and that period between finishing the class and buying the motorcycles and giving them confidence to become an owner. And so we're looking at additional refresher courses for Rider Academy to offer, also looking at various mentoring programs, but there is a lot of focus on improving the overall conversion rate.","Matthew Levatich","I'll just add. Obviously, conversion is very important, but going back to my prior comments when your focus is selling a bike, your focus stops at that conversion rate. And when your focus is on building riders, we have to actually think well beyond how many of them buy a bike to how many of them are riding. And so this is examples of the mentality shift. In the last 10 years, the Riding Academy has trained almost 0.5 million riders and 25% of them were trained in the last 2 years. How many of those actually became avid full-time riders, that's the work we have to do to make sure that our efforts are focused on the right thing which is building riders. Whether they buy a new bike or whether they buy a used bike and how the role -- how used bikes play a role in people entering the sport and the brand from a price point perspective, et cetera, is very important to this whole constellation of things that we need to do to build riders, not just sell machines.","John Olin","David, I think the other part of your question, you asked about the economics of used. And we've talked a little bit about that already. As we have seen and the industry has seen, used bikes prices soften. And on the face of it, feels like a negative thing, because it does put short term pressure on new motorcycles. And we're not viewing it as a negative thing. We're viewing it as an opportunity to get more people into the Harley-Davidson brand. And we see the vast majority of outreach people coming in. Even though 40% come in on new, a lot much higher percentage of that come in on used. Young adults, in particular, are several times more likely to come in on used than new. And so what we're trying to do is just change our thinking around that and look at it more as here's an incredibly loyal customer that we've got, comes in on used.","We don't make as much on the upfront piece of that. We do make money on the financing, the parts and accessories, the credit cards, the H.O.G. memberships and all the things that we do offer. But that is an annuity way into the future and a rider for life. And as we look to build 2 million more riders, it becomes very important and used becomes a big vehicle to bring people in. And certainly, the short term headwinds as used bike prices fall, but over the long term we feel very good about it. Now having said that, we have picked up a tremendous amount of a market share on used. Ever since the currency has flipped back in the fourth quarter of 2014, our used bikes have sold very well and much faster than new motorcycles. ","The first quarter of this year no different, the used bike is delayed by a month, but when we look at used sales through February, they were up over 5% for Harley-Davidson. And that put total demand up through that same period of up over 4%. So you look at our new sales much softer than that. But overall, people are choosing Harley-Davidson motorcycles over other brands and market share in the first 2 months was up quite significantly on used and you saw market share was up 4\/10ths of a point United States on new.","Matthew Levatich","And just one further comment, because I think you had mentioned the role of new bike pricing in that equation and not just the price and I made this comment earlier, but the appeal and the impact of that product and Street Rod is a great example of an incredibly appealing motorcycle to the next generation of riders, priced right for them to access the sport on a new vehicle, the work that we're doing in flat track racing to stimulate the excitement around competition and so forth. So there's a whole host of things that we're doing in this spirit of shifting our mindset to building riders. And there's more to come. The teams are busy. Already, you can see the creativity that this has stimulated. Once we start thinking differently about what we're here to do, the ideas about how to do it are flowing and we're excited about that potential.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel from Bernstein.","David Beckel","You mentioned the market weakness over the last year and change. Do you have a sense at all for how the market for new bikes would have performed absent oil and gas weakness or weakness in used prices? That is, would sales have more closely tracked traditional economic indicators? Or do you think we're really starting to see the beginnings of a shift in demographics that you're essentially preparing for in your 10-year plan?","John Olin","David, that's a great question. I wish I had the answer for it. A piece of it is that certainly on the weakness of oil-dependent we can be quantitative on that. We define that as about 15% of our overall volume is in oil-dependent areas. And last year, overall, that market was down about 10%. So last year that was probably 1.5 to a couple of points of growth. Last year, I think, overall, the United States was down -- jeez, my memory test -- 3% to 4% and so that explains a part of it. The used bike pricing is much harder to get our hands around as far as what a driver is. And then you've got all the other stuff that happened last year, the political, the uncertainty.","We believe that played into it, but no real way to measure it. Suffice to say though that we're now lapping 4 quarters of it at a new lower level of the industry and we're seeing used bike prices improve, albeit just at the auctions at this point. And we know that we're lapping some big numbers on the oil-dependent and we would expect that to start to become stable as the year continues to progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Just a few questions. First, I just was hoping that you could clarify, John, something you said earlier. You gave us the second quarter unit shipment guidance. So when we think about the second half and the cadence there, I think you said that would be more skewed to the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then if we just could kind of look back at the first quarter and we've talked about it a lot, but I was just wondering if you could talk us through the cadence of the quarter, the months in terms of retail sales, how they trended? Like were they kind of better earlier in the quarter and maybe kind of decelerated throughout? And then, clearly, given the comps and the bad weather last year, April should be better. So I was just wondering if you could give us any color you have on that.","John Olin","Okay. Thanks, Felicia. So to clarify on the overall shipments. We were down 12,000 units in shipments in the first quarter. We expect to be at 80,000 to 85,000 of shipments in the second quarter which is down 4% to 9% and down about 3,000 to 5,000 units. We would expect most of that first half decline of 15 to 18 or whatever that works out to be, 15,000 to 18,000-ish, we would expect that to move to the back half, but mainly into the fourth quarter and again, that goes to our desire to tighten up inventory over the first 3 quarters.","And then as we add it back in the fourth quarter, that helps us get to the trajectory that we need to have enough motorcycles in the spring selling season of model year '18. With the surge production and capability that we have, we need to end the year at about year-ago levels to make it for the next year's bikes. So that will largely come back in the fourth quarter. With that will come back the profitability of those shipments and with that will come back a lot of absorption and therefore, make the fourth quarter a higher profit quarter as well as on gross margin significantly improved during that quarter.","The second question was with regards to the first quarter retail sales and the cadence within the quarter. When we look at the quarter, January, February did much better than March. March was a very tough month for the industry and certainly, for Harley-Davidson. We picked up a fair amount of share in the month of March, but overall it got tougher in the month of March. And when we look at the overall regions, we saw a softness in the West, Southwest and North East. Other markets were good. And as we -- we didn't talk about weather, we don't think that weather on a full year -- or a full quarter basis impacted overall sales. It was one of the warmest quarters, but was also one of the wettest quarters. And -- but it did have some impact on various markets within the U.S., but others benefited. And I'm sorry, on April, with regards to the sales, we don't comment on any quarter retail sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Just wanted to dive into a little bit of what you're doing from the HDFS standpoint which you're potentially doing from a rebate standpoint, if you are at all. Our channel checks throughout the quarter kind of pointed to you doing more preferred financing which you mentioned was discontinued as of February for model year '16 bikes. But we had heard that some of the dealerships were layering on some incentives to move out the model year '16s. And then more recently, we've heard that Harley-Davidson itself is offering some rebates or dealer incentives, if you will, to help move some of that model year '16 inventory. So I just wanted to get your comments on that if that is actually occurring or not and how typical or atypical is that for you to offer those types of rebates to move some of that slower-moving inventory.","John Olin","Thanks, David. #1 is HDFS. All of our programs that are company-sponsored ended at the end of February. And -- but various dealers, HDFS would be -- puts together custom programs for dealers. They would pay for that, whether it be lower rate or no down. So that certainly could be happening out in the dealer network. But what we were sponsoring ended at the end of February and that was 60 months at the top tier at 0.99% financing. With regards to rebate, I don't think that's the right term. But we certainly recognize the fact that we put in too much inventory at the end of the second quarter and the excess carryover of model year '16 was higher than it's been historically. It's higher than we intended it to be and we certainly didn't see what was going to happen with the industry over the next couple quarters. And so with that, that was part of the 3 programs that I had mentioned. And with regards to helping the dealers out, yes, we have provided incentives to the dealers to help defray the cost of them moving those motorcycles. And that is very atypical, but it is also very atypical that we've had this much carryover inventory model year 2016s.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","You mentioned that Victory picked up share. And I'm wondering what kind of impact do you think that could have had on you. And if -- as the brand is shut down, could that reverse? And do you think those are customers that otherwise would have bought a Harley, you think could benefit from Victory winding down in the longer term?","John Olin","Good question, Greg. When we look at the Victory liquidation, in the first 12 -- when they announced liquidation, we believe, estimates of the data that we have, they had a little bit shy of a year's inventory in the system in the United States. And we would expect that to sell much quicker than it typically would over a year's period of time. And we saw that in the first quarter. Overall, the sales of Victory were up quite a bit and with that it benefited the industry. So the industry would have been down more than 5.9%, excluding Victory. And consequently, because we're 50% of the industry, our market share would have been up quite a bit. That doesn't mean that we believe that we're losing sales because of that. It just means the timing of those shipments are going to happen in a condensed period of time and the term that you used, Greg, I think, is right on. That impact or that effect will reverse itself when the inventory is liquidated. The industry will have a headwind because it will be comparing less overall sales because a year ago there were sales of Victory motorcycles and the impact on our market share will reverse and it will benefit our market share, we believe, largely in the back half of the year.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","I just have a quick question on your high-impact models. You guys launched 2 high-impact models and you're still clearing 2016 models and there's limited 2017 models. So how do you guys on a strategy sort of level think about launching these new high-impact models during these periods of industry distress? And going forward, how does the cadence of that change when the environment is difficult to launch into and it might be a little bit harder to take pricing?","John Olin","So we've had no issues with pricing, but Jaime, that's exactly why we took the actions in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of limiting shipments in the United States by 30% and 21% respectively. As we knew these models are coming out, we want to launch them and we always, not for the purpose of new models or any other reason, we always want the inventory and the business model that we follow to be is that they're selling predominantly new motorcycles each and every quarter of the year. And again, for the events of that we talked about, we got a little bit away from that.","We produced excess model year 2016s and that's why we addressed it. It was a tough thing to do. I mean, Jaime, look what we did. We took the hottest selling product that we've had in Milwaukee-Eight and constrained it. Not only is it the hottest product selling, it's the most profitable. And again, that shows the resolve that we have in making sure that we're aggressively managing supply in line with demand. So to answer your question, those models both came out. We did not change the timing of those models. They both came out late in the third quarter and as we exit the third quarter, we feel very good about the market situation -- I'm sorry, I said the third quarter -- the first quarter. We feel very good about how we exited the first quarter in terms of overall inventory levels and mix and we're ready to go.","We're ready for the spring selling season, these 2 models. We've got a little bit more data on the Road King Special. It's selling fantastic. We will gain distribution in the Street Rod in international markets largely by the middle of April and we're very excited about that. And when you look at our International business, remember, in Asia Pacific, Street is by far the best-selling model that we have and now we've got a new model to that family. It's got 18% more power, 8% more torque, refined suspension and brakes. We couldn't be more excited. But we see no issues in launching the Road King Special or Street Rod in this market.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Lisa and thank you all for your time this morning.

Throughout 2011, everyone at Harley-Davidson has been hard at work transforming our company. We've come a long way and I couldn't be more proud of our team. And I know our entire team finds it gratifying to see these efforts reflected in the financial results that we reported today.","Our fourth quarter continued the positive trend of this year. We had strong improvement earnings in Q4, capping off a year in which earnings more than doubled from 2010. And the year finished strong at retail as well. New Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up almost 11% worldwide compared to last year's fourth quarter and up almost 6% for the full year. And sales were strong in both the U.S. and the international markets. Once again, we gained market share.","For the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson held a 59.4% share of the U.S. heavyweight market, and our 2011 full-year market share was 55.7%. These results are a demonstration of the dedication and hard work of all of our employees and our dealers to be customer-led and to fulfill customers' dreams through remarkable motorcycles and extraordinary customer experiences. We are committed to be world class in everything we do to be more agile, more efficient and more effective at developing and building great motorcycles and delivering them to customers around the world.","Let's take a look at some of the key milestones along our journey. In 2011, we made great strides in the transformation of our York operations. All the motorcycles there are now built under one roof on one assembly line. But even more powerful than the bricks-and-mortar change is the change in the culture, where the employees in the line are creating and implementing operating improvements on a daily basis.","Similar changes are underway in the operating structure at Kansas City and we're on a fast ramp-up in Milwaukee and Tomahawk in preparation for the new contract that will enable these changes in just a couple of months. And our CKD operations in Brazil and India are implementing these operation systems as well. We also moved into a new facility in Brazil to give us the capability and the capacity to meet the needs of that growing market going forward.","When it comes to creating remarkable motorcycles, we have reengineered our entire product development approach and it really started to gain traction in 2011. The goal is to implement a laser-focus on the best product opportunities, to reduce time-to-market and increase product development capacity through efficiencies. And while this work is more behind the scenes and not as visible as manufacturing, it's just as significant.","At retail, we began the work with our worldwide dealer network to provide the capabilities and systems that will improve all the ways that Harley-Davidson interacts with customers. The goal is to provide a premium retail experience with every customer everyday and everywhere in the world while strengthening our dealer profitability. One example is e-commerce, where in 2011, we laid the foundation for an entirely new, rich and distinctly Harley-Davidson online shopping experience that will roll out this year. And in 2011, we continue to expand in international markets. We opened regional headquarter offices in Singapore to support the Asia Pacific region and in Miami to support Latin America and Mexico. We added 35 dealers in international markets, including Mexico, India, Thailand, Turkey, China and Brazil. In fact, in Brazil, we completely restarted retail operations through 11 new dealers. And together with the team here at Harley-Davidson, they have done a fantastic job and it's the key reason, along with improvements in Mexico, for the 17.5% retail sales growth in Latin America in 2011.","And there are many other examples of progress, including the nearly completed efforts to rightsize the U.S. dealer network and to support them more effectively and our continued success reaching young adults, women and other outreach customers, even while we retain remarkable brand loyalty with our existing customers, or outperforming a flat S&P 500 with a 12% rise in share value.","And while we're encouraged by all this progress, there's still a lot to be done over the coming months, and our team is working harder than ever to deliver on our goals. And as we look at the rest of 2011, we will continue to keep a close watch on the marketplace and remain cautious in our expectations at retail, given the degree of continued economic uncertainty, including regions like the euro zone. ","But our vision is clearly set on the future as we continue the transformative work that's underway, and we continue efforts to restore margins and profitability and to continue to meet the challenges of the ever-changing marketplace. By transforming our approach to product development, manufacturing and the retail experience, we believe we will continue to exceed customers' expectations globally to create growth opportunities and sustain our business for all of our stakeholders.","So again, I want to thank all of our employees, our dealers and our suppliers for their tremendous efforts in 2011 and for their hard work in the coming year. And thanks to our shareholders for your investment in Harley-Davidson. So I'll be back later to answer questions, but now let me turn it over to John Olin.","John Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I will review the financial results, starting on Slide 9 with the fourth quarter results. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 9.3% behind a 14.0% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our fourth quarter income from continuing operations improved to $54.6 million, an increase of $96.7 million. Similarly earnings -- diluted earnings per share rose to $0.24 per share, up from the year-ago quarter, which was a negative $0.18 per share. Operating income from the Motorcycle business was up $35.6 million, up $42.3 million compared to last year's fourth quarter. The strong increase in the Motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments and a higher gross margin as compared to last year, partially offset by higher SG&A and restructuring spending.","Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 30.7% behind improved credit loss performance. Finally, our improved financial performance for the quarter was also driven by a lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of the December 2010 repurchase of $297 million of high interest notes.","We are very pleased with the fourth quarter's results and continued progress against our growth strategies and the transformation of our business.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 10. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up nearly 11% in the fourth quarter, the largest quarter-over-quarter increase in the past 25 quarters. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 5.9% compared to 2010. This reflects global product appeal -- strong global product appeal, worldwide dealer efforts and our continued investment in growth opportunities around the world.","In the U.S., retail sales in the quarter were up double digits despite the challenging but slightly improving economic environment. Sales in the U.S. during the quarter were supported by strong product offerings, improved consumer confidence and improved product availability.","For the full year, U.S. retail sales were up 5.8% and the full-year market share strengthened by 0.8 percentage points to 55.7%. Retail sales in international markets for the quarter grew 9.7%, driven by growth in all regions. For the full year, international retail sales were up 6.1%. ","During the fourth quarter, Latin America was up over 40% as the dealer networks in Brazil and Mexico continue to come up to speed and tap into new growth opportunities in those markets. Canada was up 18.8% in the quarter, which pushed Canada's full-year retail sales into positive territory for the year. Sales in the quarter benefited from consumers in Qu\u00e9bec purchasing motorcycles before a sales tax increase took effect in January. ","The Europe region was up nearly 6% for the quarter compared to 2010. Similar to last quarter, Germany, France and emerging markets saw a strong retail sales growth partially offset by softness in Southern Europe and the U.K. Market share through November was 7 -- 13.7%, up 1 percentage points, our highest market share ever in the European market.","Retail sales in the Asia Pacific region were up 2.5% in the quarter, driven by double-digit sales growth in both Australia and emerging markets, partially offset by declines in Japan.","On Slide 11, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up compared to last year and within our expected shipment range of 45,500 to 52,500 motorcycles. Temporary production constraints at York eased during the fourth quarter, allowing a higher mix of Touring motorcycles compared to last year. Sportster represented 18.1% of total fourth quarter shipments and finished near the high end of the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year, which was expected due to strong demand for Sportster models and because York production has been temporarily constrained.","Slide 12 provides some additional detail on the U.S. dealer network inventory and demonstrates the strength of our brand as measured by total demand in the U.S. During the fourth quarter, inventory in the U.S. grew nearly 10,000 units from third quarter 2011 level as dealers prepared for spring. Year-end U.S. dealer inventory was up slightly compared to last year. We remain committed to aggressively managing new motorcycle supply in line with demand. We believe that the U.S. dealer network profit margins have improved compared to last year behind higher retail sales and prudent management of their cost structures. Used bike sales in the U.S. dealer network were up double digits through November compared to the same period last year. When you combine used bikes sold through all channels with new bike sales, total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. remains strong.","On Slide 13, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Product segment was up 12.0% in the fourth quarter and up 11.6% for the full year behind strong growth from all our businesses. Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue was up 13.5% behind the 14.0% increase in shipments during the fourth quarter and up 13.3% behind a 10.7% increase in shipments for the full year.","For the full year, the average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $340 from the prior year, primarily driven by favorable currency exchange. Parts and Accessories sales were up 7.9% for the quarter, driven in part by holiday sales promotions, focus on product availability and growth in new and used motorcycle sales. For the full year, P&A sales were up 9.0% over 2010.","General Merchandise was up 12.8% in the fourth quarter, as a result of increased sales in certain categories such as leather and sportswear. For the full year, General Merchandise revenue was up 5.8% over 2010.","Turning to restructuring on Slide 14. For the last 3 years, we've been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable in the future. York continues to be a key focus of our restructuring activities.","During the fourth quarter, we continued to experience downtime, but we achieved our targeted throughput rates by the end of the fourth quarter, which was ahead of our initial expectations. Also during the fourth quarter, we announced our plan to exit our Australian wheel and hub manufacturing operations. We experienced $6 million in temporary inefficiencies during the quarter and $32 million for the full year. Restructuring expenses were $19.0 million for the fourth quarter and $68.0 million for the full year, which was slightly lower than anticipated. We have adjusted our remaining total projected restructuring costs to reflect refined timing and reduced the range of total expected program costs due to favorability to date. ","We expect temporary inefficiencies in 2012 to be generally in line with our 2011 temporary inefficiencies, as we complete the restructuring at York, implement our new labor contracts in Kansas City and Wisconsin and exit our wheel manufacturing operations in Australia. ","In the second quarter of 2012, we plan to implement a new ERP system at York, which we expect will give us many new capabilities across the supply chain, including the ability to do more factory customization, enable more flexible production and provide end-to-end supply chain integration. We expect to experience downtime at York as the system is installed and our employees manage through the steep learning curve.","To minimize the impact on dealers and customers during the implementation, we produced more motorcycles than typical in the fourth quarter and expect to carry higher company inventory into the second quarter of 2012 when we expect production to be impacted by the ERP implementation. As a result, fourth quarter inventory was up $92 million, largely due to approximately 7,000 additional units that were built during the quarter.","As of the end of 2011, we realized $217 million in annual ongoing savings as a result of restructuring activities, which was within our expected range. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $315 million and $335 million upon completion of our restructuring activities.","On Slide 15, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 31.2%, which was 1.6 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin for the quarter was favorably impacted by all areas noted on the slide, except raw materials, which were unfavorable due to increased metals and fuel costs compared to last year. Manufacturing benefited from restructuring savings and incremental margin on higher volumes. ","Full-year gross margin was 33.4%, which was 0.8 percentage points below the prior year and slightly lower than our expected range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Gross margin was impacted by higher than expected raw material costs and mix that was less favorable than expected.","On Slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 3.5%, up 4.2 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A and restructuring costs. As expected, SG&A was roughly $6 million higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year, driven by the recent rate recalls -- switch recall.","For the full year, SG&A increased $41.7 million from 2010, largely a result of investment in growth and the recall. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 1.3 percentage points lower at 19.9% as compared to 2010. We expect SG&A spending will increase on a year-over-year basis as we continue to invest in growth but decrease as a percent of revenue through 2014.","Now moving on to Financial Services segment on Slide 17. In the fourth quarter, HDFS profit increased $13.3 million or 30.7% compared to last year. The 3 key drivers of fourth quarter results were: the provision for retail credit losses was $8.6 million lower in the fourth quarter 2011 versus the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to lower credit losses as a result of favorable retail receivables performance; Second, provision for wholesale credit losses was $3.2 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to favorable wholesale credit loss performance; and finally, HDFS operating expenses were $3.7 million lower than last year.","On a full-year basis HDFS posted an operating profit of $268.8 million, an increase of $86.9 million or 47.8% compared to last year. As we look forward to 2012, we believe HDFS' operating income will decrease compared to 2011, primarily due to the lapping of approximately $40 million of 2011's balance sheet allowance releases. We cannot assume a similar financial benefit will reoccur in 2012. We expect 2012 operating income will also be impacted by lower net interest as a book of retail loans continues to contract and modest tightening of margins on prime tier retail lending.","We are very pleased with the performance of the business and believe HDFS provides a competitive Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Related Products.","Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 18. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 14.2% or $43 million. This increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations behind a strong increase in retail sales and a 2.6 percentage point increase in market share. Used motorcycle loan originations also increased compared to last year.","For the full year, HDFS retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 51.0%, up 3.1 percentage points compared to last year.","In 2011, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime, in line with last year. At year end, 74% of our total portfolio was comprised of loans originated post underwriting changes made in January 2009. However, with the higher level of receivables originated prior to the start of the economic downturn rolling off the books, finance receivables outstanding decreased 4.5% compared to a year ago. This declining receivables pool reflects the lower U.S. retail sales through the downturn and will continue to impact HDFS net interest income. ","During 2011, HDFS was focused on prudently increasing overall credit application approval rates, and we saw a modest increase in the fourth quarter. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time and delivers an appropriate return on equity.","We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 19. The 30-day delinquency rates for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2011, was 3.85%, or 122 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 91 basis points to 1.20% for 2011 compared to last year, driven by the impact of changes in underwriting implemented 3 years ago, as well as a lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery value of repossessed motorcycles.","A portion of this loss improvement is due to recoveries on loans written off in prior years. Given the strong credit performance of loans originated since 2009, we expect lower levels of recoveries in future periods. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2011. During the year, we maintained a strong liquidity position, reduced our cost of funds and delivered strong profitability. We remain focused on enabling sales at Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. The most recent example of this is a $225 million dividend HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. earlier this month.","Now let me turn it back to John.","John Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 20. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes the impact of a $525 million asset-backed securitization transaction that HDFS completed during the quarter at a weighted average rate of 0.99%. In addition, HDFS had $920 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. ","Earlier this month, there were 2 significant transactions related to cash in 2012. Larry just mentioned the dividend HDFS paid to H-D Inc. We also made a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans, which will reduce our year-end pension and post-retirement liability of $571 million.","I'm also very pleased to report that during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $127 million. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 21.","I'd like to highlight 2 items on this slide. First, with regards to continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $885 million during 2011 after a $200 million contribution to our pension plans. The motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flow of $673 million of operating cash during the year. And second, for the full year, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 30.9% compared to 33.5% in 2010. In 2012, we expect full-year effective income tax rate will be approximately 35.5%.","As noted on Slide 22, during the fourth quarter, we realized a $51.0 million benefit on income from discontinued operations driven by the reversal of prior-year tax reserves related to our divestiture of MV Agusta. We do not anticipate any further financial implications associated with our sale of MV Agusta.","The summary for the full year 2011 financial results is on Slide 23. We had net income of $548.1 million from continuing operations in 2011, which was double compared to last year's results. Earnings were positively impacted by higher revenues and improved operating margins in the Motorcycle segment, strong operating income at HDFS, lower year-over-year interest expense as a result of repurchase of $297 million of debt in 2010 and a lower effective tax rate in 2011 as compared to 2010.","On Slide 24, you'll see that for 2012, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 240,000 and 245,000 units on a worldwide basis, up 3% to 5% from 2011. Our full year 2012 shipment estimate takes several factors into consideration, including macroeconomic concerns, near-term production limitations driven by our ongoing restructuring activities and our strategy to move production closer to retail sales. First, while we are encouraged by our strong retail sales in the fourth quarter, we remain cautious on the U.S. recovery and concerned over the continuing debt crisis in Europe. In 2012, we will continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand.","Second, as I mentioned during the restructuring comments, we expect temporary capacity constraints to offset or to affect our production volume in the second quarter. To mitigate production disruptions during the implementation of the new ERP system in York, we expect to carry higher company inventory into the second quarter of 2012 and we expect production to be impacted by the implementation. ","Lastly, our 2012 shipment guidance takes into consideration a new capability to efficiently flex our labor force starting in the first half of 2013. This capability is a key component of our strategy to be more flexible and to efficiently produce motorcycles closer to customer demand. Beginning in early 2013, we expect to be able to increase production at our York facility by adding flexible workers, thus increasing capacity utilization in the first and second quarters of 2013. Consequently, in the U.S. we expect our detailer -- our dealers to retail more units than we ship in 2012, thereby lowering year-end retail inventory in the U.S. dealer network. Our ability to maximize flexibility in the entire manufacturing system will occur in 2014 when the same capability will be in place for our Kansas City and Wisconsin operations.","During the first quarter, we expect shipments -- we expect to ship between 58,000 and 63,000 units in an effort to increase U.S. first quarter dealer inventory and prepare for second quarter implementation of the ERP system. This increase in the first quarter shipments is possible because the York plant is currently running at our targeted throughput. We expect full year 2012 gross margin will be between 34.75% and 35.75%.","We expect gross margin will be positively impacted by incremental restructuring savings, increased productivity from everyday continuous improvement opportunities, and the 2012 model year pricing actions announced in July 2011. We believe that product mix, raw materials and temporary inefficiencies from our restructuring activities will be comparable to 2011 levels, while we expect currency to be a headwind in 2012.","Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which includes approximately $25 million of capital related to restructuring. ","As we look back on 2011, we are very pleased to deliver strong results and progress on many fronts. As Keith and I mentioned earlier, earnings for 2011 more than doubled. We also repurchased 6 million shares of our stock for $218 million during the year. Retail sales in all regions were up compared to last year and we gained market share in major markets around the world, as increasingly more diverse customers are being drawn to the Harley-Davidson experience. We have made great strides towards transforming to a best-in-class manufacturing and product development, and have sharpened our focus on continuous improvement across the organization. We'll continue to prudently manage through any challenges the future might bring, and we are excited about the long term. We remain focused on executing against our strategies to complete the transfer -- to complete the transformation of our organization and grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You guys kind of touched on this a little bit, but I just wanted to talk about your unit guidance for 2012, just to understand it a little bit more clearly. You mentioned that it's heavily weighted through the first quarter. You booked in inventory in the fourth quarter, you built funding in the first half just to kind of compensate for potential disruptions. I'm just wondering, I just want to make sure that I'm interpreting this correctly, based on that comment, would you expect unit growth to be up again in the second quarter? And then is it possible for us to see units down for the rest of the year? And then just one follow-up with gross margins, I was wondering if you could just walk us through the components of the $17.9 million improvement related to manufacturing, because that was the biggest difference between your actual and our estimates.","Lawrence G. Hund","Okay, Felicia. Again, as you had mentioned, in the fourth quarter we were running very well at York and we produced 7,000 more units of product from York that will hold that inventory for shipment in the second quarter. Our guidance for the first quarter is up, I believe, 8% to 17%. And with that, we hope to build a little bit extra in the first quarter too to bring that into the second quarter. We're not providing specific guidance for the second quarter at this time. But to say that given the implementation of the ERP system, production will be affected quite a bit, probably during the quarter down about 40%. So again, we're not going to provide second quarter but we should have inventory to cover the implementation of the ERP system or the downtime caused by that. And the second question, Felicia, I believe was the $18 million of manufacturing favorability in the fourth quarter. And that was driven largely by the restructuring savings that we've had coming in. So when we look at restructuring on a full-year basis, we had $45 million of favorability, and a lot of that came in, in the second half, in the second quarter and the -- I'm sorry, in the second half, in the third and fourth quarter, and that's largely the $18 million. Also benefiting manufacturing in the fourth quarter was the incremental volume that we produce.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So maybe I missed this, but you guys missed the guidance. So I'm just trying to figure out where that -- well, I guess the quarter came in lower than we would have expected based on your guidance. So I was just trying to understand where the difference was.","John Olin","Yes. So overall -- so on a full-year basis, let's talk about full year, we had gross margin of 33.4%. Our guidance as of the third quarter was 33.5% to 34.5%. And so that would put -- we missed a little bit expectations in the fourth quarter because we gave that guidance in the third quarter. Two things that affected our profitability in the fourth quarter in terms of gross margin, and one of them was raw materials. Raw materials increased in its unfavorability from 7.9% to 9. -- $7.9 million to $9 million dollars. Given the fact that our shipments went down by about 20%, we had expected raw materials to come down a little bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So that was a little bit of it, it takes time for the raw material increases to flow through the system. And we would expect the raw materials cost to start to mitigate at this point going forward. The second area is mix. So coming out of the third quarter, we had an unfavorable mix of about $27 million driven by the disruptions at York at that time. We said we expected mix to be favorable in the fourth quarter and it is by $1 million. However, we did expect a little bit more favorability out of mix. Good news is, is that the mix was not driven by our Touring production. Matter of fact, Touring production was 42.6% of our overall production for the quarter, and over the last 3 years, that's the highest production of Touring that we had. I think one other quarter, we're also at 42.6%. So again the plant was working very well. So where mix was a little bit less than expectations was on model mix, and an example of that would have been high-content CVO and very high profitable CVO models. So we pushed some of that off and we'll make it up in ensuing months, given the high content and the complexity of that. Another example of mix being a little bit less than anticipated was in our Parts and Accessories business. I mentioned in the third quarter that we've got to focus on increasing our share of market in consumables, which tend to have a lower margin, and those sales were up quite considerably in the fourth quarter, which is great news but it did affect our mix a little bit negatively.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, you said that you plan to retail more than you ship in the U.S. What is the worldwide expectation?","John Olin","The worldwide would be the same. In aggregate, we would expect shipments to be lower, given our capability to move production closer to demand. However, given the shipment of international at the time it takes to get the bikes to international markets, we would not expect a big move in international inventories. But on a worldwide basis they'll be down, led by the U.S.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So on a worldwide basis you expect to reduce inventory?","John Olin","Yes.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then a quick follow-up, on SAP, could you give us any milestones to focus on for 2012 as you make progress on that initiative?","John Olin","Well, right now, we're -- we feel great about where we're at. We're in the final phases of testing and we will begin the implementation in the second quarter. So we'll know a lot more by the time we report earnings at the end of the second quarter. So we feel good about where we're at. We've built up inventories so that we don't disrupt the flow of product to our dealers and customers. And it'll be installed by the end of the second quarter is the plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Just wanted to delve in a little bit more with the shipment guidance for 2012. As we think about that 3% to 5% growth rate, obviously, there are a lot of puts and takes with what you're doing. I guess, my question is from a production standpoint, should we think about that 5% as ultimately the maximum amount of shipments we could get from your production given the inefficiencies at York? Or is that 5% more indicative of where you think retail is going to be once you've sort of account for some of those puts and takes?","John Olin","Well, James, overall, 3% to 5% is driven by the 3 things: Concerns over the macroeconomics, in particular in Europe; Some capacity constraints that we have in the first half; and the fact that we will be taking inventory out of the overall system, which suggests that retail will be a little bit higher than year ago. When we specifically look at the production constraints, they're huge in the second quarter. We were able to build forward in the fourth quarter. So from a shipment perspective, we're hoping to cover that. But from an upside perspective, the first half is very limited. Back half, we have a little bit more flexibility. But again our selling season is largely in the spring and the summer season. So we could go over the 5% but it would be more in the back half production versus first half. We are very constrained in the first half in terms of production.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","So ultimately, I guess, put another way, if retail -- and obviously you don't give guidance on the retail. But if retail came in much better than your expectations, you could do more than that 5% from a shipment standpoint, assuming that it was -- at least a good chunk of that came in the second half.","John Olin","Yes. We have more production capability in the second half of the year.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, I didn't hear -- I don't know if you really detailed it, but there was the big recall within the quarter. Can you quantify that for us? And where did that show up on your income statement?","John Olin","The recall, we announced sometime during the fourth quarter. We booked a charge of $11.8 million and that was to provide for a rear tail light switch that we needed to replace on a little over 300,000 motorcycles. I believe it was a $2 to $3 part, but with labor, the total charge is $11.8 million. And James, that falls into SG&A. So you see for the quarter, SG&A was up $6 million. It was driven by that charge of about $12 million that we took.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, if you could just kind of go over, if you could, a little bit at the timeline, you'd outlined how the inefficiencies from York occurred in each of the quarters in 2011. Can you kind of talk about us -- to us how that should look as far as where you should see the peak inefficiencies? I would guess it would potentially be in the second quarter. You did comment that for the full year, those inefficiencies, I think York, but I thought the way you phrased it would be -- for the whole system, would be comparable year-over-year. So that's question one. And then maybe a question here for Larry regarding market share for HDFS. Larry, looking to 2012, would you anticipate holding share or could -- given the increased competitiveness, especially in the super prime categories, could you see that share potentially erode a little bit?","John Olin","I'll take the first part of that question, Tim. With regards to the temporary inefficiencies timing, this year, we -- number one, is we do expect temporary inefficiencies to be in line with last year. Last year, the aggregate temporary inefficiencies were $32 million, and that was driven by the first quarter of last year at $11 million, and they kind of tapered off and ended the fourth quarter at $6 million. We're not going to provide the timing of the overall inefficiencies next year, but certainly the second quarter would be a time where we would see an increase. And -- but we'll also have temporary inefficiencies in the back half of the year, as we do the transformations at KC and Wisconsin in terms of the training that needs to be done there, as well as we move our wheel supply to alternate suppliers. So those will affect our backhalf temporary inefficiencies.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just to clarify on that, John, the second quarter could actually be up year-over-year on the inefficiencies standpoints, just given the magnitude of things that are occurring in that quarter.","John Olin","Yes, it certainly could be.","Lawrence G. Hund","And then this is Larry, Tim. On HDFS market share, our market share for the year was 51%, and we picked up 3 points a share this year. I would not expect to see significant growth beyond that. We are seeing some competition in the prime space. But I also think we're out there with competitive programs and we should have a reasonable share next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It sounds like you're expecting just only a modest mix benefit in 2012. And I'm wondering how much do you expect that the capacity constraints will affect that mix number this year? In other words, is the inventory depletion that you're expecting to see in 2012 with retail increasing faster than wholesale shipments, is that depletion going to come from products that are more favorable from a mix perspective?","John Olin","Well, Ed, when we look at overall mix, we expect it to be flat. We got to remember that all kinds of things affect mix, and within motorcycle mix, there's location, there's family, there's model. And then there's parts and accessories. So one it says it's a tough thing to zero in on. But when we look at overall mix, we take in to consider new product offerings, incremental growth that we've got in our international markets and our outreach efforts that are tend to be more toward the lower end product, and then we certainly got the strong demand for a higher end. The capacity constraints will affect a little bit our mix, but in aggregate, when we take it all and blend it all together, it looks to be that mix will be pretty flat versus year ago.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just one follow-up, if I could, on HDFS. You released, I think the number was $40 million of reserves in 2011. I know you're not expecting to replicate that in 2012, but do you see any room to release additional reserves this year even if it's more modest than what you had in 2012?","John Olin","Right now, we feel great about where we're at with the reserves. And based on where we're at right today is, no, we would not. But we'll continue to read the situation in what credit losses due next year and continue to evaluate the overall portfolio and make adjustments as we see at that time. But at this time, we feel very good about where we're at with regards to our reserves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to maybe go a little bit off in left field and talk about India. As you've been ramping up there, kind of that there any benchmarks you can share with us about the performance in India so far and ultimately how you think that market developed versus a market like China, which probably hasn't been as strong of a market as you might have hoped initially?","John Olin","Okay. Sharon, we feel very good about India. We put up an initial, I believe, it's 7 dealerships in the first year of operation. We expect to add another 3 dealerships next year. We're bringing more models in to do CKD, which provides a much more favorable pricing environment. So we were doing 3 CKD units and we're going to add 2 more as we look forward and, again, lower the price of those units that we're assembling in country. So overall, we feel very good. When we look at it from India and China, I think we probably would expect to see both of them as tremendous long-term growth for the company, and probably a little bit quicker in India than China. But both of them are going to be a good long-term investment and we're not expecting to see huge gains in terms of moving the overall company needle in the near term. But those markets are growing at extreme rates on a year-over-year basis at this point.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And, I guess, John, when would you expect those markets to actually be material, the results? Is it 2015? Is it 2020? I mean, what's kind of the game plan?","John Olin","Sharon, we can't provide anything that far out. What we're doing -- what we know today is we're doing the right things. We're building the right dealer and distribution network. We've got the right teams landed to build the markets and we're building the leisure sport of motorcycling as we go along. So I don't think it's going to be way off into the future, but it will be in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just wanting to dive a little bit into these production constraints a little bit more. Just wondering first of all, does it -- does the fact that you are going to be constrained, does that affect your pricing strategy at all? And then as we look beyond 2012, as this increased flexibility comes online in 2013, can you talk about what your theoretical capacity might be at that point? Would it be 260 or 280? And also in 2014, it sounds like additional flexibility comes online. How should we be thinking about not necessarily what you're going to produce but what you theoretically can have the flexibility to produce once you're done?","John Olin","Rod, with regards to the production constraints as we've talked about for the last year and certainly in the first half of next year, we'll have production constraints. Does that affect our overall pricing strategy? The answer is that temporary constraints do not affect our overall pricing strategy. What we're working now to do is to build on long-term pricing power, and we feel good about where we're at and that's making sure that we've got the right products in the market at the right time. We feel great about the fact that in July of this year, we were able to raise prices in a very difficult economy, 1% in the United States and 0.75% in Europe, brought it down actually a little bit in Asia Pacific. So the temporary constraints do not affect our pricing strategy. But certainly our strategy is to improve our pricing power of our overall products. The second question was with relationship to our flexible manufacturing strategy. So part of the overall York restructuring and the new contracts that we've got is to be able to flex our production capability in the high season or the selling season. And we're going to ease into that capability next year, and we'll have that capability for York. And then in 2014, we'll be able to do it across the system, including the engine plant here in Wisconsin. With regards to capacity, it gives us a tremendous amount of capacity on a much smaller footprint that we had previously. We're not going to provide an exact amount of capacity. But what we've said is that we will have enough capacity without any huge investments to get back to where we were -- in a ballpark, where we were pre-recession.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just on the restructuring that you're doing, there's some companies that have implemented these SAP systems pretty successfully and others have bid and tripped up a bit. And you guys are implementing all of this while there's a lot of, I guess, you could say instability or restructuring going on within your existing manufacturing. Could you just talk a little bit about what key items you see that kind of determine success or issues within the implementation of this? Do you see this as a significant risk for 2012 or would you expect things to go relatively smoothly?","John Olin","Our expectation is for them to go relatively smoothly. Having said that, any system implementation is subject to learning things on the fly. We've tested the system dramatically. We've been working on it for over 2 years. And what we know today, we feel very comfortable, and all the testing that we've done, we feel good about where we're at. It doesn't mean that there won't be hiccups. But what we believe is that any hiccups that we might have will not come through and affect our customers and dealers given the inventory that we have. And -- but the answer is the confidence is driven by the vast amount of testing that we've been doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Just kind of circling back to the gross margin issue, and I knew you talked about you had lower guidance on October and kind of reiterated that lower guidance in November. And then when you came below here, you've mentioned FX -- you mentioned currency impacting $9 million instead of the $7.9 million. I guess, it doesn't look like that would be enough to have to account for the miss in gross margin unless raw materials' prices changed so much in the last month of the quarter. But even that $9 million versus the $7.9 million, if you could just give a little bit more color on what else may have been behind that, and then I do have a follow-up question as well.","John Olin","So as I had mentioned earlier, the 2 things that missed our expectations were a little bit on mix. We expected a slightly more favorable mix and slightly less on unfavorable raw materials. Actually currency, Robin, for the quarter was favorable $3.9 million. And certainly exiting the third quarter, we saw our currency rates falling quite dramatically. The euro continued to fall a bit but we saw some recovery in the real and the Australian dollar. So currency was not an issue for us in the fourth quarter, it was the raw materials. And again raw materials, given our shipments down, we were expecting more of a plateauing in the fourth quarter. And now we'll expect that plateauing in raw material costs in the first quarter.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I might have misspoken when I said FX, I know it was a positive for the quarter, but I guess the raw materials you're mentioning impacting $9 million instead of the $7.9 million, and that's the delta I was talking about wouldn't really explain -- wouldn't be enough to explain the gross margin miss. But I guess you're saying it's -- mix is the other piece of it.","John Olin","Well, it's not just the $1.1 million on raw materials because shipments were down from about, I don't know, 60-some thousand units to 50,000 units. We would have expected raw materials to be down at the same rate level. So what we saw was a continuing rate increase as things flow through the system on raw materials. So it wasn't just the $7.9 million versus the $9 million. It's the fact that we didn't ship in -- our shipments were much less in the fourth quarter, we would expect that raw materials to be a little bit lower.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And my -- the follow-up question I have with your comment earlier about the 3% to 5% shipment growth in 2012 being more limited by -- it sounds like that's more limited by your if you have retail demand than by your production constraint. Can you talk about being able to maybe go above that in the second half? So if that's more limited by your retail demand, I wonder if you can comment on kind of, I guess, confirm that I guess and how does that tie into your expectation of U.S. dealerships closing? I think at one point you had said 5% and I don't know if that was for 2012 or for sort of a 12-month forward from the fall.","John Olin","Okay. I did not say that the shipments was more driven by retail. I said there's 3 things that we were watching closely, and one of them was the macroeconomics. We feel great about where we see retail sales in the U.S. but certainly remain cautious as we look forward given the tentative nature of the overall economy in consumer confidence. But we're pleased the consumer confidence is up. We are more concerned about retail sales in Europe, given the fact that they may already be in recession or may slip into recession there. The temporary capacity constraints is holding our production down certainly in the first half of the year. And then the other piece of it is that we intend to take inventories down and that would suggest that retail sales would be higher than our shipment estimate. So again there is -- we've not weighted them in any different way except to say all 3 of them, as we look forward, provides a shipment guidance of 3% to 5%. And we'll respond on the activities throughout the period. The other piece that you had mentioned, Robin, is the dealership closings. We do not expect this to have a big impact on our sales at all. The overall strategy was to help improve dealer profitability. We've been very successful there. And we've seen a great rebound in dealer profits in 2011. When we look at dealer closings, during the year, I believe we closed 22 dealerships or consolidated 22 dealerships in 2011. I think the previous 2 years, we had done about 60 in total. So about 80 dealerships overall, which represents probably about 9% of the dealer network from pre-recession levels.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And in 2012, your expectations for dealer closings?","John Olin","We don't have any expectations for dealer closings or providing anything in 2012. It's not our main focus. We feel very good about where the dealer network is today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz from the MorningStar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about what you expect for both raw material costs in the year ahead, if that's going to ease? And also on any trends you've seen in new versus used pricing?","John Olin","In what pricing?","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","New versus used.","John Olin","Sure. Okay, Jamie, raw material costs. Obviously, we've seen a great runoff in raw material costs in fuel over the last year. And most of the metals' complex seemed to kind of peak in April of this year, but it didn't retrace. It just kind of plateaued in April, and as maybe a little bit better in the fourth quarter. Now it takes anywhere from 3 to 6 months for that to flow through our inventory. Where commodity prices are going to go in the future, don't really know. Right now our expectation is that raw materials will be flat versus year ago. And again, we would expect to see raw materials as on a rate-basis peak in the next quarter. And we kind of thought they would peak this quarter and they're still flowing through at higher prices. So year-over-year, we would expect them to be in line with last year. And secondly, with regards to new and used pricing, we look to add some through, I believe, November used sale -- actually, used bike sales is up about 8.6% and total demand's up about 7.6%. So we're still very pleased with the strong total demand for our product. And in the fourth quarter, we started to see a shift. We're closing up the gap between new and used sales growth. So we're starting to see used sales growth come down a little bit and certainly seeing new accelerate. And that's what we've said would happen as we -- as the prices kind of equalized out in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to clarify the dealer closings, that 22 dealership number, was that net or gross? And can you break that out between U.S. and international, please?","John Olin","The -- those are only in the U.S. and those are net. Those are the big dealerships that we consolidated out. So we've always got a churn of dealerships that we're repositioning and replacing and so on and so forth. So the net system was down by 22 dealerships this year. Again, international, I don't even know what the number is. We didn't have the same issue internationally. There was some dealerships that came in and out. What we did from a closing standpoint -- from an opening standpoint, we were able to open 35 new international dealerships in our quest to open 100 to 150 dealerships. And the vast majority of those are in emerging markets. And we feel great about where our emerging market group is today.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great, very clear. And on the recall charge, you comfortable with $11.0 million reserve? And of the 300-and-somewhat thousand bikes covered, do you have an estimate of how many have actually come in for service for the brake light switch repair?","John Olin","No. I don't -- we don't -- I don't have an estimate what that percentage is. When we look at the overall $11.8 million, we feel very comfortable with it. We've assumed a very high take rate, a higher take rate than we typically would on recall just because of the size of it. So we feel great about the reserve and making sure that we hit that reserve at $11.8 million. But I don't have the actuals to this point, Gerrick.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up, I apologize if you touched on this, but the dividends that you paid from HDFS, did you basically use that to fund your -- sorry, the pension contribution?","John Olin","Well, I don't know, Felicia, if -- that wasn't the intent. Money is money. So we did have a dividend paid from HDFS to the Motor company. Last year, we had one also. It was $125 million. And as we look at the amount of equity that we need to run HDFS on and to keep a conservative debt-to-equity, we had more funding in HDFS than we needed. So they dividend it back, $225 million. At the same time, we saw our pension liability increase a fair amount. So at the end of the third quarter, our pension liability -- pension and post-retirement liability was about $370 million with falling discount rates, which by the way, helps our Financial Services business, does not help our pension [ph] accounting. And we saw the pension liabilities increase by a little over $200 million, and that's what we funded in the first quarter. They're completely unrelated, but both necessary.","Operator","As there are no further questions at this time, I turn the call back over for any closing remarks.","Amy Giuffre","Thanks for your time everyone, this morning and we appreciate your investment in Harley-Davidson.

The supporting slides can be accessed on our website by clicking on Company, Investor Relations, then Events and Presentations.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, you'll hear from Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund. Then we'll open the call for questions.","So let's get started. Keith?","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today on the call. As you saw in the earnings release, Harley-Davidson had a great third quarter. We had strong financial performance; we had strong 2014 new product launch, which resulted in good retail sales; and we celebrated the 110th anniversary in Milwaukee. And all the credit goes to our employees, our dealers and our suppliers, who all continued to do an outstanding job of delivering on our key strategies and manufacturing, product development and retail. All of these folks come to work everyday with a relentless focus on providing our customers a great experience.","Just 2 months ago, in Denver, we introduced our new 2014 motorcycles, including the Project Rushmore bikes, and these have generated tremendous excitement from dealers and customers alike. The 2014 model year rollout was the biggest launch of new motorcycle models in the company's history, and we executed the most comprehensive marketing reveal ever to support it. The results at retail speak for themselves. When the initial 45 days at retail since launch, the Rushmore motorcycles sparked the largest year-over-year new model sales increase in 20 years. Sales were up strongly in both the United States and internationally. And it was the best international model year launch ever in terms of initial volume.","And these motorcycles sold extremely well among both our traditional core customers in the U.S., as well as our outreach customers consisting of young adults, 18 to 34, women, Hispanic and African-American riders. For each of these demographic groups, the top-selling model year '14 bike has been the Rushmore model. It all added up to a great quarter at retail. The third quarter was big for Harley-Davidson in other ways, too, especially the 110th anniversary weekend in Milwaukee. Just 10 days after the 2014 model year launch, thousands of riders converged on Milwaukee over Labor Day weekend for the kind of huge party and experience that only Harley-Davidson can throw. The event brought riders together from all walks of life including H.O.G. members from Egypt, Taiwan, Greenland, Germany and beyond. In all, more than 40 countries were represented. It was the culmination of a year-long global 110th anniversary celebration on 6 continents that connected millions of Harley-Davidson fans around the world. And it was covered by the media far and wide, resulting in 1.2 billion media impressions for the Milwaukee event alone. The 110th anniversary and the 2014 new model launch were the latest milestones in what has been a great year so far. And as we look at the remainder of the year and beyond, we're excited about the opportunities for the brand and the company. And while we've achieved a lot, we expect to continue to reap the benefits of our product development, manufacturing and retail strategies for the company and for our customers alike.","As always, there's more to do and we take nothing for granted. We continue to double down on the progress we've made and remain focused on building a successful business for the long-term. So again, I wanted to just thank all of you for your continued interest and investment in Harley-Davidson.","And now I'll turn it over to John Olin to give the details behind the numbers.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the third quarter financial results starting on Slide 9.","During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 7.5% to $1.34 billion. Our third quarter net income improved to $162.7 million, an increase of $28.7 million or 21.4%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.73 per share, up 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.","Operating income from the motorcycle segment was $175.5 million, up 21.2% compared to last year's third quarter. The strong increase in the motorcycle business was driven by an 8.4% increase in revenue behind a shipment increase of 2.3% and a favorable shift in mix. Additionally, motorcycle segment operating income benefited from higher gross margin and lower restructuring spending, partially offset by an increase in SG&A.","Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 5.1%, behind increased net interest income. The net income also benefited from a favorable tax adjustment in the quarter. In all, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 10. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 15.5% during the third quarter, driven by an increase in both the U.S. and international retail sales. Third quarter retail sales results reflected a very positive response to our 2014 model year motorcycles and improved product availability in the U.S.","In the U.S., retail sales were up 20.1% versus the third quarter of 2012 and international retail sales were up 6.5% versus prior year, behind improved sales across all region. On a year-to-date basis, worldwide retail sales were up 4.1%.","As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we feel great about our brand, our business and our future. We expect continued momentum behind our very exciting model year 2014 motorcycles.","On Slide 11, you'll see retail sales in the U.S. were up 20.1% in the third quarter. Retail sales growth in the quarter were positively impacted by the exciting and well-received model year 2014 motorcycles, significantly improved motorcycle availability and relatively easy comps to last year. Our share of the U.S. heavyweight market increased 1.7 percentage points to 56.5% in the third quarter, which represents another record quarter of market share. On a year-to-date basis, retail sales in the U.S. were up 4.1%. We exited the first half of 2013 with retail sales down 2.7%, which was below our expectations for a very weather-challenged second quarter. At that time, we said we believe that a portion of the 2013 selling seasons, retail sales may not be recovered by the end of 2013. Despite the strong third quarter results, we continue to believe that the loss sales in the second quarter of this year will continue to put pressure on achieving the high end of shipment guidance.","Turning to U.S. dealer retail inventory. Retail inventory was up approximately 4,200 motorcycles at the end of Q3 compared to 2012. Availability of some new models was very tight in the quarter, which is to be expected following a model launch of this magnitude. We do not believe tight inventory levels on select models will result in loss sales.","Overall, we have been comfortable with dealer retail inventory levels throughout 2013. We believe the dealer-inventory levels in Q1 through Q3 are approaching the levels that we believe are aligned with our flexible manufacturing [indiscernible]. We continue to expect Q4 retail inventory to be down compared to last year as we prepare to implement surge production at our Kansas City facility early next year and as we remain committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand.","On Slide 12, you'll see third quarter retail sales in our international markets were up 6.5%. In our EMEA region, Q3 retail sales were up 1.6% driven by our investment in emerging markets, which were up 28.3%.","Our European markets remain down by 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. We continued to see some modest growth in the northern Europe country led by the U.K. and Germany, while the southern European companies remain down, Italy posted its first year-over-year quarterly increase after being down for 8 consecutive quarters.","During the first 9 months of 2013, our heavyweight market share in Europe was 12.6%, up 0.8 percentage points versus the same period last year. Our market share gains in Europe are encouraging, especially in light of the economic situation and promotional discounting by our competitors. We remain concerned with the ongoing economic challenges in Europe and the potential impact on our European business. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across Europe and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets in the region.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 10.0%, driven by strong growth in emerging markets, especially India and China. Latin America region retail sales were up 15.6% driven by Brazil and Mexico. At the end of this quarter, there were 15 dealerships operating in Brazil versus 11 dealerships in the year-ago quarter.","Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 7.0% in the third quarter. As we have discussed, we are very focused on investing in our international businesses. We are targeting 100 to 150 international new dealer points through 2014 and, over the last 3.75 years, we have opened 110 new dealer points, with 2\/3 being in emerging markets. We are very excited about the growth prospects in our international businesses.","On Slide 13, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were around the midpoint of our expected range of 51,000 to 56,000 motorcycles, and up 2.3% compared to last year. During the quarter, the mix of touring motorcycles increased 7.6 percentage points over the prior year to support the initial shipments of new Rushmore models and as we lap last year's touring production, which was impacted by the implementation of the ERP system at our York facility.","As a total -- as a percent of the total, international shipments were 3.5 percentage points higher than Q3 2012.","On Slide 14, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was up 8.4% in the third quarter, including a 10.7% increase in motorcycle revenue largely driven by the strong mix of our touring bikes. During the quarter, we introduced our new 2014 model year motorcycles. Wholesale and MSRP prices have increased by an average of about 3.5%. By region, U.S. prices are up roughly 4.25%; EMEA, up 1.5%; and Asia-Pacific and Latin America, each up about 2.5%. The significant content, which was added to the 2014 model year motorcycles is expected to increase costs by 2.75%, resulting in wholesale pricing in excess of cost of about 3\/4 of a percent. Despite the strong revenue and profit improvement that we expect from these pricing actions, it is important to note that we expect our model year 2014 price increase net of related costs will dilute motorcycle gross margin percent by roughly 0.5 point over the next year.","For the quarter, average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $1,203 from the prior year period, primarily driven by favorable mix and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. On average, our key currencies during the third quarter were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 7% compared to last year.","During the quarter, parts and accessories sales were up 7.0%, driven by the success of certain innovative product categories such as LED lighting and audio. General Merchandise was down 12.6% compared to Q3 2012 due to lapping the strong sell in of 110th anniversary apparel and accessories, which began in Q3 of 2012.","Turning to restructuring on Slide 15. Since 2009, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and transforming the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. As we exit our restructuring activities, we will continue to focus on improving the retail customer experience, strengthening our world-class distribution channels and accelerating our product development capabilities. We have established a culture of continuous improvements and will continue to look for ways to operate in the most efficient and profitable manner.","We continue to expect annual savings in 2013 from all restructuring activities of approximately $305 million and approximately $320 million on an annual ongoing basis beginning in 2014.","For the third quarter, we recorded a restructuring expense of $0.6 million versus an expense of $9.2 million in Q3 of last year. We also experienced approximately $3 million in temporary inefficiencies versus approximately $11 million in last year's third quarter.","On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 35.3%, which was 0.6 percentage points higher than last year. Volume, price, mix, raw materials and manufacturing were all favorable for the quarter, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Foreign currency exchange continued to be unfavorable during the third quarter as a result of the sizable devaluation of the Yen, the Real and the Australian dollar on the year-over-year basis. Foreign currency exchange impacted -- impact reduced our third quarter's gross margin by about $4 million or approximately $0.01 of EPS.","As we look forward, we continue to expect foreign currency to adversely impact gross profits in the third quarter -- the fourth quarter.","Favorable manufacturing costs reflect the benefits from restructuring and lower temporary inefficiencies as compared to last year's third quarter. Manufacturing costs, however, were adversely impacted by higher-than-normal start-up costs for our new model year motorcycles. Start-up costs were approximately $7 million higher-than-normal, driven by the extraordinary level of content added to our new models.","On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 14.9%, up 1.6 percentage points compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and lower year-over-year restructuring expense, partially offset by higher SG&A spending. SG&A dollars were up $16.2 million or 7.2% compared to Q3 2012. The increase included incremental spendings to support the Rushmore product launch, the 110th anniversary and continued investment in our growth initiatives. We continued to expect SG&A spending will increase on a year-over-year basis in 2013 as we continue to invest in growth.","Additionally, last week, we issued 2 voluntary recalls affecting roughly 29,000 Trikes, Touring and Softail motorcycles. We anticipate a one-time $4.9 million charge to SG&A in the fourth quarter.","Now moving onto the Financial Services segment, on Slide 18. In the third quarter, HDFS operating profit increased $3.7 million or 5.1% compared to last year. The 2 primary factors impacting Q3 results were: First, net interest income was up $6.8 million, driven by a lower cost of funds; and second, the change in the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable by $6.5 million on higher credit loss reserves due to increased receivables and higher retail credit losses. We are pleased with HDFS's third quarter performance. On a full year basis, we continue to believe HDFS's 2013 operating income will be modestly lower than 2012, which benefited from approximately $17 million of 2012 credit loss reserve rate releases. Going forward, we continue to expect pressure on HDFS's operating income as a result of increased competition and modestly higher retail credit losses due to lower recoveries, changing consumer behavior and HDFS's funding of additional subprime loans, which we believe are prudently structured.","Finally, while key benchmark interest rates have increased during the year, we continued to believe HDFS is well-positioned to navigate the changing interest rate environment. Given its diversified funding portfolio, we expect higher interest rates to only have a minimal impact on HDFS's earnings in 2013. But we believe rising interest rates will result in compression of HDFS's lending margins over time.","Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations on Slide 19. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the third quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 29.9%, or $190.2 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year new retail motorcycle sales and a 7.7 percentage point increase in retail financing market share. For the third quarter, HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. increased to 60%, compared to 52.3% in the third quarter of 2012. The primary drivers of the market share gain during the quarter were the pricing changes in the prime segment, which were initiated in the second quarter in response to increasing competition and the strong sales of Touring product.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 4.5% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio is solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. In the third quarter of 2013, between 75% and 80% of our new loan originations were prime.","Moving on to credit performance on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at September 30, 2013, was 3.11% or 13 basis points lower than 2012. This is the lowest third quarter, 30-day delinquency rate in over 10 years. Year-to-date annual retail credit losses increased by 23 basis points to 0.88% compared to 2012, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years. This was expected given the lower level of credit losses in the past few years, which left a smaller pool of potential 2013 recovery dollars.","In addition, in the third quarter, HDFS experienced a modest increase in losses due to lower recovery values of reprocessed motorcycles following the launch of our new Rushmore motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS, as we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, deliver a solid credit performance and contribute strong profitability. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Now let me turn it back to John.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. You will see that at the end of the quarter, we had $1.15 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.56 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain, a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $92.8 million. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders.","Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22. I would like to highlight 2 items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $825.1 million during the first 9 months of 2013. Operating cash flow was up $112.6 million from last year, primarily driven by increased earnings. And second, the tax rate through 9 months was 34.3% compared to 35.3% in the year-ago period. This reflects the benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and an adjustment of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2013. We now expect a full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34.7%.","On Slide 23, you'll see that for 2013, we continue to expect Harley-Davidson motorcycles shipments to be between 259,000 and 264,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4.5% to 6.5% from 2012. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 45,000 and 50,000 motorcycles, which is in line with last year's fourth quarter shipments of 47,067 motorcycles. We believe the underlying demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. are strong. However, as I said last quarter, we believe we lost sales volume as a result of poor weather in the second quarter, which will put pressure on our ability to reach the high end of our full year shipment guidance.","We continue to expect full year 2013 gross margin will be between 35.25% and 36.25%. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our gross margin percent will be in line with last year's fourth quarter. Gross margin will reflect the ongoing benefits from restructuring savings and lower temporary inefficiencies. However, as we have discussed, production will be lower than last year's fourth quarter as we prepare to implement surge manufacturing in Kansas City earlier next year. Q4 mix is expected to be unfavorable as we lap the higher-than-normal 46% Touring mix at last year's fourth quarter due to the Q3 2012 ERP implementation. We also expect currency exchange to have an adverse impact on the fourth quarter gross margin. And finally, we expect Q4 gross margin percent will reflect the dilutive impact of our model year 2014 price increase net of related costs.","Capital expenditures in 2013 are expected to be between $200 million and $220 million. Looking back, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our key accomplishments. During the quarter, we launched the most significant new model year in our history, celebrated our 110th anniversary in Milwaukee and delivered shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. We continued to position the company for the long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",".","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If we could -- if I could just ask a question on gross margins for a moment. I really appreciate all the color that you've given, it's very helpful. Just wondering if we could understand a bit -- how long you think it might take to just get up to learning curve on the new bikes? And then, you gave us color on the fourth quarter, I know you don't like to give guidance, I'm not asking for guidance. But just wondering if you could kind of frame for us some, perhaps, some pluses on the gross margin side to think about next year. And I'm asking specifically because the Street has almost a 90 basis point improvement in gross margin expectations for next year.","John A. Olin","Okay, this is John. Thanks, Felicia. With regards to -- I think the first question was centered around gross margin in the third quarter. And in the preamble, we had talked about increased costs in the third quarter due to starting up the Rushmore model year. So given the complexity, the size, the number of models of both Rushmore and ABS on our Sportsters and some of the other models that we introduced, we had higher-than-typical startup costs of about $7 million. So on a year-over-year basis, the quarter benefited from lower temporary inefficiencies in terms of restructuring. We had $11 million in the prior year versus $3 million this year, and a lot of that favorability was really taken up by the fact that the startup costs were higher than they typically would be. They are up to speed, the plan is up to speed, and we don't expect any additional costs or that's -- so kind of a one-time startup for Rushmore. We don't expect any costs on a go-forward basis. As we look at next year's gross margin, we'll provide more guidance in our Q4 conference call. But on some of the positives that we anticipate for next year, certainly the pricing and incremental volume that we would anticipate, some of the headwinds may continue to be currency and then perhaps raw material costs. But again, we'll give more insight to that at the end of the first quarter conference call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Milota from JPMorgan.","Kevin Milota - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was hoping you could just clarify, John, the negative impact from the model year '14 bikes. Was it 50-basis-point negative impact on the gross margin front?","John A. Olin","It was about -- thanks, Kevin. With regards to the startup cost, about $7 million would have been -- about 60 basis points, 6\/10 of a margin point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","I guess, a follow-up to that last question. Could you help us frame what the net pricing impact would have been to gross margins in the third quarter? It sounds like that was a negative. You gave us that for next year, or over the next year, what that negative impact was. Can you help us out with that, in the third quarter? And then, I guess, just also from a capacity perspective, the guidance that you gave us for the fourth quarter, is that the extent of what you could possibly produce? Or if you see some upside to retail, could we potentially see upside to shipments in the fourth quarter?","John A. Olin","Thanks, James. So we talked about net pricing. Number one is, it has a dilutive impact on gross margin percent, but we shouldn't talk about this in a negative light. We have increased our revenues by 3.5% with our model year 2014 pricing. Now with that came higher cost at about 2.75%. So net of -- pricing net of cost is up 0.75%. So basically, when you look at 0.75% increase in profit and 3.5% increase in revenue, that comes out to a gross margin of about 21%. And given the fact that the business operates at a 35.25% to 36.25% gross margin percent, it is a somewhat dilutive of that gross margin. So James, what you had asked is how much, that's about 50 basis points, about 0.5 point of gross margin. Now again, with that, we're getting a fair amount more revenue and more profits and certainly delivering more value to our shareholders. But it is a slight drag on gross margin that we saw in the third quarter, and we'll see again in the fourth quarter and the first half of next year as well. The second question that you asked is with regards to capacity. When we look at our shipment guidance in the quarter of 45,000 to 50,000, we're certainly taking into consideration surge manufacturing coming up at Kansas City in the first half of next year, and are looking to take overall retail inventories down, meaning that we will retail more this year -- our dealers will retail more this year than we ship in. With regards to capacity, we have certainly plenty of capacity in the fourth quarter that, if we needed to or chose to, that we could made more units.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With the new products, the strong retail trends and what we think is lean inventory, you would seem to be in a position to allocate your inventory to those dealers that are kind of optimizing your priorities. How much flexibility do you have in terms of inventory allocation in an environment like this?","John A. Olin","The overall inventories, we feel good about where we're at in terms of inventory. We are seeing some tightness in select models, in particular, Rushmore models. We've got an allocation system that we believe is fair to all our dealers and we continue to execute against that allocation system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping that -- you've commented before on the 50% incremental margin that you expected in the motorcycle business, and I was just hoping that you might be willing to reconcile that to the gross margin bridge that you provided on Slide 16, presumably, which takes some -- take the volume and take the manufacturing and maybe add back in the $7 million of startup costs. But your motorcycle revenue was up by $90 million. Your motorcycle revenue ex parts and accessories is up $83 million. So can you just walk that for us?","John A. Olin","From a directional standpoint, Rod, when we look at that bridge on Page 12 and translate it into gross margin percent, right, you see the overall dollars setting adding up to the $38 million, volume would be -- have no impact on gross margin percent. Motorcycle pricing is unfavorable by about 0.5 point in terms of gross margin percent, even though it's delivering $10 million of profit to the organization. Mix would be slightly favorable; currency, slightly unfavorable; raw materials, slightly favorable; and then manufacturing, considerably favorable. That $9 million doesn't have a revenue component, so that would provide about a benefit of 8\/10 of a gross margin point. So when you take all of those and add them together, you're up about 6\/10 of a point versus prior year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But when you've historically talked about a 50% incremental margin on the incremental dollars that come in from your growth, I would...","John A. Olin","Yes. So what we've said is that for each incremental unit that we sell, that typically has a gross margin of about 50% versus the core business that's at 35% and 36% -- 35.25% to 36.25%. Most of that, Rod, would come through in the manufacturing piece. So that's where the absorption is of the fixed costs of manufacturing.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So you had that manufacturing of $9.3 million, but it was really, if you add back the $7 million, it's like $17 million; and you had volume benefit of $4.8 million, so you get up to, like, $21 million. But your revenue was up something like $90 million. So is there -- is that something that is not necessary holding right now because of relatively modest volume changes, or how should we be thinking about that?","John A. Olin","No, it's certainly holding. The $4.8 million, though, is strictly on volume. It has nothing to do on margin, so would not come down and be reflected at all in that manufacturing line. In the manufacturing line, the way to think of it is there is 4 main buckets. There is productivity, which includes a restructuring savings; there is incremental margin based on the increased production, not necessary shipment, but increased production; there is the year-over-year impact of temporary inefficiencies, which is favorable $8 million; and then there is startup costs that are unfavorable by $7 million. All that together winds up to be $9.3 million. And when you divide that by the revenue, it's adding 8\/10 of a gross margin point on a year-over-year basis.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The inventory built that you were -- you talked about, is that basically entirely attributable to the Rushmore units? And can you give us any kind of color on the -- how significant are the sales of discontinued models like the Road Glide at this point at retail?","John A. Olin","At retail, for the -- the quarter end, we had about 4,200 units higher in inventory, and the majority of that would be Touring motorcycles: One, because the overall split is pretty significant in touring; and number two is that's certainly the success of those models in preparing for sales into the fourth quarter and beyond.","Amy Giuffre","He asked about the discontinued models.","John A. Olin","So the discontinued models are Road Glide. We had -- with Rushmore, we came out with 8 models; on a year-ago basis, that's comparing to 10 models. We took 2 models out of the lineup, which are Road Glide Custom and Road Glide Ultra, which represent, on an annual basis, about 10% of overall -- or I'm sorry, of Touring volume in 4% to 5% of our total volume. When we look at the third quarter, in terms of retail sales, we had pretty brisk retail sales of the Road Glide. So I would say that in the third quarter, when you're looking at retail sales, we're not seeing a headwind from Road Glide at this point, and we'll start to see that in the fourth quarter and first and second quarter of next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of items here. John, a lot of people have asked about gross margin. And clearly, I mean, at the Analyst Day, you and Keith alluded that the Rushmore benefit would be to the first half of 2014, but then the back half of the year you'll sort of get some normalization after that. So how can we think about gross margin cadence with the restructurings being over on a longer-term basis? And then secondly, with your excess free cash flow here, are -- you're going to start talking about a payout ratio target, or is all the incremental free cash going to be returned to shareholders after Mr. Buffett's repaid in February of '14?","John A. Olin","Okay. With regards to our gross margin, as we look forward, again, we expect gross margin in terms of incremental volume, pricing, and those are the main drivers. When we look at Rushmore, Rushmore should provide mixed favorability in the short term. But on a long-term basis, we would expect mix to be flat over time, as we continue to develop products for both our core customers and our outreach customers. When we look at a return of capital to our shareholders, what we are -- we're not basing it off or not providing a payout ratio. But what we have said and will continue to do is return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends or share repurchase. Tim, you had mentioned that we do have a large debt coming due in February of next year, that's $303 million of high-interest debt that during the downturn we borrowed from Berkshire. And that will be paid out of operating cash, and we will not look to refinance that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm guessing from your commentary on the new product -- new products that you did not see a drop-off in sales in September, is that correct? And then also, when you talked about the benefits of gross margins in 2014, you mentioned incremental volume; does that mean that the volume growth rate is going to be faster in 2014, or you're just saying that than it was in 2013 or is it just an increase year-over-year?","John A. Olin","Thanks, Greg. We typically don't comment on growth rates within a quarter. Sufficient to say that we were certainly pleased with the overall growth of retail sales in the third quarter, I mean the U.S. being up 20.1%, and certainly, international up 6.5%. When we look at volume growth...","Amy Giuffre","The next question that you had, Greg, was on the 2014 gross margin?","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Well, yes, on the -- Well, you mentioned that 2014, you'd see incremental volume that would contribute to or benefit the gross margins for 2014. So does that mean you're just -- yes.","John A. Olin","I'm sorry. Yes, Greg, we will look to provide guidance in the fourth quarter conference call late January. We're not going to provide any guidance at this point.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I was just wondering, when you said incremental volume, what you meant by that? Was it just you're going to see an increase year-over-year or was it a faster growth rate than 2013? I just want to understand what you meant by...","John A. Olin","I was not talking to any comparative growth rates we would expect to grow next year, and we'll provide that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick ones from me. First on HDFS, would it be possible to at least give us a directional walk about how you are thinking about it? I think you mentioned that net interest margins could compress a little bit because of some of the pricing. Then I imagine you have positive origination volume, and I'm not sure what you think of credit. So maybe kind of putting those pieces together for us as you see them. And then my second quick one is; it doesn't sound like the recall had much of an impact on production in the fourth quarter, but can you just clarify that for us as well?","Lawrence G. Hund","Okay, Patrick. This is Larry Hund to just talk a little bit about HDFS both on the kind of the volume margin side and then on the credit side. On the -- clearly, we had a strong market share this quarter. There is a lot of competition out there that we are seeing, and clearly, we made some pricing adjustments, and that helped us drive that share. So you're making sort of a volume margin trade-off there. Over time, I think, as John said, what we expect is, rising interest rates are going to put some pressure on margins in the business. If you look back historically in this business, your margins tend to widen out in sort of a falling or absolutely low interest rate environment, and then they narrow some when you get into a rising rate environment. On credit losses, I think we feel very good about where we are right now. We were 88 basis points year-to-date, and I think we feel good about that. I think, over time, we expect credit losses to normalize in that level. If you look kind of at our 10-year average, it's certainly higher than where we are for the first quarters.","Keith E. Wandell","Yes, and this is Keith. Patrick, you asked a question about the impact of the recall on production, there really will not be one. I mean, we had a slight delay in some shipments. We had some product in the plant in queue for shipment that had to go in and do the fix on, so that delayed some shipments by about a week. But overall, when you wash through this thing, there really will not be a delay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to kind of take a step back, since we're almost done with the restructuring, to talk about kind of where the potential is for Motorcycle operating margin to go over time. You've clearly seen good improvement last year and it looks like you'll have a 16%-plus kind of Motorcycle operating margin this year. So can you kind of walk through, longer term over the next 3 to 5 years, where you think that post-restructuring Motorcycle margin target could be?","John A. Olin","Thanks, Sharon. What we've said is, over the next 3 to 5 years we expect gross margin to expand modestly. We're not providing a hard number at this time. As you know, there is always puts and takes to these things. You take the first half of this year, and currency exchange has been about 0.5 point drag on overall gross margins. So it's something that we're not providing you a long-term hard number. But again, when you look at the various pieces of it, we would expect incremental margin, and certainly, pricing to benefit us into the future. While the restructuring savings will -- we still got about $15 million left that will be realized next year. There is still a lot of opportunity that we have in terms of the cost structure at Harley-Davidson: Number one is, is on continuous improvement. The whole system that we put in is designed to deliver continuous improvement into the future. And then the other big area is transformation that we've had in product development and the opportunity to continue to design out costs out of our motorcycles, and we thought the team did a wonderful job this year. When you look at Rushmore, and while the costs were up 2.75%, the content that we added is well beyond that type of cost increase. So we think there is tremendous opportunities in terms of continuing to focus on the cost structure, as well as the revenue side. And when we look at the revenue side, again, we talk about our overall strategy, kind of the \"fatten-the-tail\" [ph] strategy to continue to bring in customers on both sides. Certainly, we did that with Rushmore on the core customer side of the scale, and you'll continue to see as we move into the future, a lot more effort on the outreach side as well.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Maybe if I could ask the question a different way. I mean, prerecession, you had Motorcycle operating margins that were over 20%. I mean, is that something where you think that is fundamentally possible again in the model and is the key delta there just recouping the volume?","John A. Olin","We believe that we can continue to expand margins into the future, modestly at gross margin, and we'll expect to get continued leverage off of certainly the SG&A base. And as we look into the future, we will not grow SG&A at the same rate of revenue, and therefore, drive margins. Beyond that, we look to -- we feel great about our margin expansion. Sharon, every morning, 6,000 people wake up here and they're focused on delivering a customer experience, generating the products to drive that, as well as to improve our gross margin. So we're completely focused on delivering it and we will deliver it, but I will not provide a number at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you talk about the consumer reaction to the Twin-Cooled bikes, a pretty big deal? Was it to what you were expecting, better, softer? And being that it was only 3 of the 8 new units, how that impact your mix? Did you see more demand for limiteds versus Ultras and Streets, or the other way around?","Keith E. Wandell","This is Keith. The response has been very positive, not only on the precision-cooled engine, but on a lot of the changes that were made on Rushmore. I mean, all these changes, and there were probably roughly 100 changes -- some big, some small, were all driven by the voice of the customer. Right. That was all driven by things that the customer has been asking for and looking for, et cetera. And really, there hasn't been a noticeable change in the mix, necessarily. All of the Rushmore bikes have really sold very well. If you look at, as an example, in Germany, other significant sale, [Audio Gap] Rushmore, just because of the technology as an example, and that's a market where you think about the brakes, the radio, the luggage, the ergonomics, that's a market that's highly focused on technology. There's a saying in Germany, \"Germans love their cars, Americans drive their cars\", and that translates to the motorcycle business as well. So I think all of the changes that we've made with Rushmore listening to the voice of the customer, not just the U.S. customer, but the international customer, are paying tremendous dividends for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Yejay Ying - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Yejay in for Adam. Just a couple of quick questions. I think, you mentioned that HDFS recoveries took a bit of a hit this quarter, potentially because of the introduction of the Rushmore models. Can you comment a bit more broadly on what you're seeing in the used market? And then another one on HDFS. Have you been in contact with or received any communication at all from the CFPB on lending practices?","John A. Olin","This is John. I'll start off with the first part of it and talk about used prices in general, and then Larry can handle the second part of the question. Any time that we come out with the new model year, we certainly see a devaluation of the old ones out there. Another model year goes by, right, and they become a little bit older. And certainly, this is no difference in terms of that devaluation. But we are seeing a bit of a greater devaluation, which we would expect, given the extreme content that we've added to the motorcycles. So we are seeing the bikes being devalued still pretty early. We do not have any concerns from the Motorcycle segment perspective, is that why that price gap is expanding. The content that we've added more than makes up for any of the decline in overall used bike prices. Now that's a little bit different, and I'll let Larry comment on it. It does have an adverse impact when you look at the collateral aspect of it.","Lawrence G. Hund","Sure. When you look at recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, those have actually dropped some, I think, as we said; and that has to do -- I think, dealers with the great introduction of the Rushmore line, are a little more focused on new motorcycle sales right now, and we've seen a little bit of drop-off in some participation at some of the auctions. But overall, nothing that's been out of line with what we expected given that great new model year launch. Regarding your comment on the CFPB, we have not had any contact with the CFPB. We actually have a banking subsidiary, so we're regulated by the FDIC. But certainly, we are watching what's going on in the market very closely and their contact with other lenders, and we are working to tighten our controls and -- because, obviously, this is an area that's very important to us, very important to our dealers.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I want to piggyback on to that debt maturity question some earlier. I know there is another piece of debt due at the end of next year. Are you guys going to look to refinance that do you think? Or how should we think about the optimal capital structure going forward? And then secondly, I think general merchandise category, while it's small, it was down pretty significantly this year, or this quarter, could you just comment on that?","John A. Olin","Yes. Hi, Jaime. This is John. The debt that we have coming due in February, the $303 million, is corporate debt. That'll pay off 100% of our corporate debts. And we've historically run without debt on that side. We picked it up during the downturn. When you talk about the $500 million, 7.75% MTN that's coming due in December of 2014, that is part of the core funding for the finance subsidiary. So we would absolutely look to replace that debt. And as the interest rates stand now, we would look to replace that at a lower interest rate, that was at 5.75%. So when we look at the overall capital structure, as we look into the near future, we don't expect any debt on the motorcycle side, but we'll continue to fund the portfolio at HDFS, including that MTN that will be coming, we'll refinance that next year.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Second question was on general merchandise.","John A. Olin","And general merchandise for the quarter was down by 12.6%. 100% of that decline is explained by the year-over-year impact of the 110th anniversary sell-in. So every 5 years, we have this anniversary, which is highly anticipated, and the apparel is no different. So we come out with a whole line of 110th anniversary or anniversary apparel and accessories. That is sold in the year prior. So that was sold in in the third quarter of 2012, and this quarter, we're simply lapping that. And again, 100% of the decline is explained by the year-over-year difference between 110th anniversary product.","Amy Giuffre","All right. Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning.

You can access the slides supporting this call on harley-davidson.com. Click company at the top of the homepage, then Investor Relations and Events and Presentations.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, our President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin will be hosting the call. Matt, let's get started.","Matt Levatich","Thanks Amy, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. Before John goes into the financial results, I\u2019d like to cover the market and company performance for the quarter and provide context on what we see going forward. First, while we recognize that the environment continues to be challenging, we believe we\u2019re on the right course making prudent decisions for our future by focusing our investments on growing the sport and Harley-Davidson\u2019s place in it.","We\u2019re focused on influencing customer choice in growing our reach and impact with customers all, while delivering strong returns to investors. We continue to be pleased with our market share performance given the fierce competition in the U.S. market and ongoing global macroeconomic challenges.","Third quarter market share was essentially flat in the U.S. as we maintained our strong leadership with over half of the 601cc-plus market. Our overall market share performance in the U.S. and gains in other key global markets like Australia and Japan provide strong affirmation of the progress we\u2019re making with our investments to drive demand through awareness, access, increased ridership, and bold new products to reach more people in more places. ","An absolute highlight of the quarter was the reaction around the world to our Model Year 2017 new products. One of our key areas of focus is to accelerate the cadence and impact of new products, and in late August we delivered. We could not be more pleased with the launch of and response to our Model Year 2017 lineup, most notably we've had an extremely positive reaction to our Milwaukee-Eight engine, which we debuted on all of our three motorcycles in conjunction with the redesigned upgraded suspension.","We know what our riders want and we deliver it with a big step forward that accentuates everything we\u2019re known for; a power train and chassis package with innovative technologies that provide more torque, more horsepower, greater comfort, and enhanced look, sound, and feel. The feedback from riders, dealers, and industry experts alike has been tremendous. All it takes is one ride to feel the power, the Milwaukee-Eight engine brings to our riders and to the company going forward. The significance of the Milwaukee-Eight engine is already evident. ","In September, we saw touring sales in the U.S. increase by double digits along with increased demand for test rides. Given initial results, we\u2019re confident the entire line-up will drive our retail sales for the remainder of 2016 and position us well heading into the spring riding season and beyond. As we indicated on our last call, we will continue to manage supply in line with demand. ","We maintained production ahead of retail in the third quarter in order to support the initial dealer fill of Model Year 2017 motorcycles and we plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter to finish the year with flat year-over-year U.S. retail inventory. As we look ahead, continued softness in the U.S. industry is a clear area of concern and we\u2019re taking further steps to be sure we're positioned appropriately. ","In Q4, we\u2019ll be streamlining our organization to execute our demand driving strategies with increased focus, alignment, and agility. John will provide the financial details around these steps momentarily. Our strategy to invest in driving demand around the world is unchanged and we\u2019re steadfast in our commitment to deliver strong returns to investors, while doing so. ","Harley-Davidson has been in the motorcycle business continuously since 1903 and during that time we've experienced all types of economic market and industry ups and downs, and today is no different. We believe our strategy is sound and every decision we make is tied to driving it forward and delivering for all of our stakeholders. We\u2019re intensely focused on gaining and securing market share in the 90 plus markets we\u2019re in and doing so profitably. ","The launch of the Milwaukee-Eight powered Touring motorcycles is one powerful example of how we lead by delivering for our passionate and loyal riders. We\u2019re also investing to reach new riders by growing distribution internationally and by training new riders right here in the United States. Through September, we\u2019ve trained over 52,000 riders this year through the Harley-Davidson riding Academy in the United States demonstrating that we\u2019re building momentum and bringing new riders into our sport and brand through this fantastic competitive advantage. ","During the quarter, we opened nine new international dealerships and a total of 20 year-to-date. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add another 16 new dealers and re-enter Indonesia, all part of our strategy to increase access to our sport and brand by adding 150 to 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020. Last week I was with our Asia-Pacific team in China and Singapore. I was able to see the team in action as they continue their efforts to grow our reach and impact in these important markets. ","I was also privileged to engage with passionate dealers who are investing with confidence in Harley-Davidson's future. It\u2019s in these experiences that I\u2019m reminded of what incredible strength we have in our people and in our worldwide dealer network. Looking forward, we acknowledge that economics and political uncertainty weighs on the minds of consumers in the U.S. and in some of the other markets where Harley-Davidson competes. ","As the industry leader, we believe we\u2019re best positioned to strengthen the sport of motorcycling over time. We\u2019ll continue to manage the company and brand with the future in mind and will not compromise by taking shortcuts that would diminish customer loyalty and passion or sacrifice our strong company fundamentals. We\u2019ll lean into our strengths in product development and our unrivalled connection to our riders to continue to bring innovative products to market that drive engagement and participation in our brand worldwide. ","The new Milwaukee-Eight engine is a powerful example, but it\u2019s just one example of the strength of our product plan for 2017 and beyond. Harley-Davidson gives people a way to experience and express their own personal freedom. This is our purpose and it\u2019s a powerful motivator for everyone of us associated with this brand. You have our commitment to build on our incredible strength and deliver strong returns on your investment in us. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John. Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll provide additional insight around our third quarter financial results found in our press release and supporting slides. Starting on Slide 8. During the quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion, net income was $114.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.64. As we anticipated, operating income from the motorcycles segment was down 23.9% from last year's third quarter. Segment revenue was down 4.3% in the quarter behind a 9.1% decrease in motorcycle shipments. ","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of higher year-over-year manufacturing cost. SG&A was up in the quarter as we increased our demand driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 10.0%. At HDFS, operating income was down 4.6% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term as we continue to navigate through the ongoing challenging conditions. ","Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are summarized on Slide 9. Retail sales in international markets were up modestly. U.S. industry slowdown continued, driving Harley-Davidson retail sales down 7.1% in the U.S. and down 4.5% on a worldwide basis. ","Our increased investments in driving demand and product innovation are mitigating the effects of the intense global competitive environment, including the expanded price gaps to the competition in the U.S. and the impact of new product introductions. This is no more evident than with the overwhelmingly positive response to our Model Year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. ","Our new products drove significantly improved U.S. retail sales and market share in September. We also saw positive retail momentum in EMEA and in Asia-Pacific we are encouraged by the initial customer response as the 2017 models began arriving at the end of the quarter. Let\u2019s take a look closer look at U.S. sales on Slide 10. Q3 retail sales in the U.S. were down behind continued weak industry results. ","We believe the industry continues to be impacted by lapping year ago industry growth driven by aggressive competitive discounting, weak sales in oil -dependent areas, and softer year-over-year used bike values across the industry. While the overall industry performance is disappointing, we\u2019re encouraged with our ongoing market share stability. Our Q3 share of 601cc-plus market was largely flat. However, our share in the month of September was up a strong 3.2 percentage points.","Our year-to-date market share was up 0.8 percentage points to 50.8%. We believe our market share was driven by our demand driving investments focused on growing product awareness and ridership in the U.S. and the fantastic response to our new 2017 model motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. While our competitors continue to engage in levels of discounting comparable to last year's third quarter, we are very pleased that we were able to grow our year-to-date market share in the U.S. with our brand enhancing actions and our new and innovative motorcycles. ","In Q3, we completed the initial dealer fill of our 2017 Model Year motorcycles. This combined with weak retail sales for most of the summer drove higher than desired U.S. retail inventories at the end of the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to aggressively manage supply in-line with demand and plan to reduce production in the fourth quarter in order to end the year with U.S. retail inventory flat to prior year. ","On Slide 11, you will see retail sales in our international markets were up 1.0% in Q3. During the quarter EMEA retail sales were up 1.9%. The Milwaukee-Eight engine has received a great reception and provided a lift to retail sales in the month of September in the region. EMEA year-to-date market share was 10.3%, largely flat to prior year. Asia-Pacific retail sales were up modestly from prior year driven by strong growth in Japan and Australia. ","We expect growth in the Asia-Pacific region to accelerate in Q4 behind improving availability of our 2017 Model Year motorcycles, the planned opening of approximately 11 new dealerships, and the reopening of several readerships in Indonesia, which were exited at the beginning of the year. Retail sales in Latin America were down in the quarter driven by declines in Brazil. Brazil\u2019s retail sales continue to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty, and very aggressive price competition. ","In Q1, we increased Model Year 2016 motorcycle prices by approximately 23% in response to the devaluation of the real. Finally, retail sales growth and Canada continued in the third quarter, up 4.3% year-over-year. To support our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. ","On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 9.1% within our shipment guidance range. Third quarter shipment mix was skewed toward Touring, reflecting our investment in new 2017 Touring motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-Eight engine. On Slide 13, you\u2019ll see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was down in the third quarter behind a weak U.S. retail industry and our corresponding decrease in year-over-year motorcycle shipments. ","Revenue in the quarter was favorably impacted by currency exchange, higher pricing, and mix. As a result, the average motorcycle revenue per unit was up $1035 for the quarter. Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing for our new 2017 Model Year motorcycles increased by approximately 2.25%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of cost increased approximately 1.25 percentage points expressed as a percent of revenue. Please note that these percent increases are more favorable than the estimates we included in the new model launch video in August. ","Parts and accessories revenue was down behind lower motorcycle shipments and retail sales during the quarter. General merchandise revenue was also down driven by lower sales of sportswear and riding gear. Our gross margin review is on Slide 14. As expected Q3 gross margin was unfavorable driven by higher manufacturing cost, partially offset by favorable price, mix, and raw materials. ","Additionally, currency exchange was favorable for the first time in eight quarters driven by higher revenues behind a slightly weaker U.S. dollar. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable by $18.7 million during the quarter. We expected significant unfavorable variances and manufacturing, largely driven by cost related to both the implementation of our ERP systems in Kansas City and the launch of the new Milwaukee-Eight engine. ","We also expect the loss absorption behind lower production during the quarter as we implemented these two very successful programs. Looking forward, we expect Q4 manufacturing cost to be favorable as we return to normal operations. Over the long-term, we will continue to execute our strategies, investing in the future of our brand, and the sport of motorcycling globally, while delivering strong margins. ","On Slide 15, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 10.0%, down compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margin was impacted by lower gross margin, as well as higher SG&A as we increased our investments in demand, driving, and product development. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable profitable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible, and more profitable. ","Moving on to HDFS on Slide 16. During the quarter, HDFS\u2019 operating profit decreased $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting third quarter results were; first, net interest income was up over prior year by $2.5 million. This increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing cost; second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $10.1 million, driven by higher retail credit losses and associated increase in the allowance. ","HDFS\u2019 operational results are summarized on Slide 17. For the quarter originations were down 10.2%, compared to last year. HDFS' share of U.S. new retail sales were strong at 64.3% yet down 5 percentage points as we left the impact of last year's low rate finance offers. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% sub-prime. ","As a predominant industry lender to sub-prime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns. At the end of the quarter, we had $351.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $983.7 million of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. On Slide 18, you\u2019ll see 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet was 3.61% or 45 basis points higher than Q3 2015. ","12 basis points of the increase represents a change in mix of the portfolio after the Q2 full securitization of prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans that were part of the full securitization was 33 basis points higher than in the prior year due in part to the deterioration in oil -dependent areas and rising delinquencies across the portfolio, which is consistent with industry trends. ","The annualized credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.59% or 40 basis points higher than Q3 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.57%. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. It is important to note that while both delinquencies and credit loss rates were up versus prior year, the rate of increase has remained constant over the last few quarters. ","During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 19. A few things to note. Operating cash was down from last year, driven primarily by lower year-to-date net income and year-to-date tax rate was 32.9%, which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits in Q2. ","The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. On slide 20, you will see we did both during the third quarter. ","We will continue to look for additional opportunities that maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to our shareholders without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand. On Slide 21, you will see our overall expectations for 2016. For the remainder of the year, we are confident in our shipping guidance of 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles or approximately down 1% to up 1%. ","We are very encouraged by the momentum we experienced in the U.S. in September when our new Model Year 2017 motorcycles drove an increase in retail sales of approximately 5% and a more than 3 percentage point increase in market share. We expect worldwide retail sales growth in the fourth quarter driven by significant demand for our Milwaukee-Eight engine, our increase in demand driving investments, expansion of the international dealer network, and lapping last year's U.S. industry decline of 3.8%. ","During the quarter, we expect to ship between 44,200 and 49,200 motorcycles, down approximately 8% to up approximately 2%. As mentioned earlier, we expect to end the year with U.S. retail inventory being flat to prior year. Recognizing the slower industry growth that we are continuing to experience in the U.S., we will be streamlining our operations to be even more focused, aligned, and agile. ","We expect a fourth quarter charge of approximately $20 million to $25 million, primarily for employee separation and reorganization cost. Including on the reorganization charge, we continue to expect SG&A to be flat to up modestly and operating margin for the motorcycle segment to be 15% to 16% for 2016. As a percent of revenue, we now expect SG&A to be largely flat to prior year. ","Overall, we're thrilled with the initial response to our new Model Year 2017 motorcycles, despite the weakness in the U.S. industry retail sales. It highlights Harley-Davidson as a leader in new product innovation and reinforces our strategy to invest in new product development. We are on the right path, are disciplined in the execution of our strategies, and continue to make necessary decisions, intend to support the prudent retail inventory position and protect our strong brand and profitability into the future. We will continue to navigate to the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long-term. ","Now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Conder","John. First of all John congrats to the cub so far, just wanted to pass that along. Just on the overall related to HDFS, just conceptually, your things are ticking up a little bit, as would be expected with the overall credit cycle here. But can you kind of give us a framework, looking versus the past, Granite, Missouri, Dyer period with the financial crisis. Over a cycle, just any type of framework you could outline for us, where you would anticipate those losses going over the next cycle in a downturn perspective?","John Olin","Thanks, Tim. When we look at both delinquencies and credit losses, we certainly have seen an increase on a year-over-year basis. And starting with delinquencies, as we've discussed, the delinquencies have been at historical lows. I mean, they have really been low since the last 3 or 4 years. And so with the rise, and we've seen on a year-over-year basis about a 33 basis point increase. That increase has held steady over the last three or so quarters, but is higher year-over-year. But even with that, Tim, delinquencies are near historical lows and certainly still much better than they were prior to the downturn that we experienced. ","So we're keeping an eye on it. HDFS is doing an absolutely fantastic job, working collections, as well as tweaking the underwriting that we've got. And we talked a little bit earlier, we made some underwriting adjustments in oil-dependent areas in the United States a couple of quarters ago. The other piece of that is credit losses and credit losses are also up in the neighborhood of 40 basis points year-over-year, which is certainly a concern. Still, when you look at credit losses over this period of time, Tim, we are in the 10-year historical average that we've had in terms of credit losses. And both in terms of delinquencies and credit losses, we're certainly within the models in our pricing and within our expectation of overall losses. ","Similarly, with credit losses, we've seen those rise a little bit more and longer than we have in terms of delinquencies. And that is really due to the softness that we've seen in the auction market that really started back in Q4 of 2014, somewhat aligned with the shift in world currencies. But again, overall, we\u2019re within what we've seen in historical norms over the last 10 years. We're not providing any projections going forward. But again, HDFS is addressing what we've got and making the changes that are necessary to continue to maintain their industry-leading profitability at HDFS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi good morning. Two quick questions, I guess, on the reorganization during the fourth quarter. Are there any ongoing savings associated with that? And then, secondarily, just wanted to get your thoughts on taking price both domestically and in some of the international markets, given the weakness you're seeing.","John Olin","Thanks, Sharon. With regards to the reorganization, as we had mentioned, we're recognizing the challenging U.S. industry and taking the prudent actions to appropriately size the organization. With that, we'll have the charge of $20 million to $25 million. And the benefit of that will be the $30 million to $35 million of savings into 2017, and really that will be deployed to protect our margins as we look to move into 2017 in a more uncertain U.S. industry growth profile. ","And with regards to the overall pricing, we had mentioned that for the Model Year, we increased prices by 2.25%. And when you look at the value that we've added to our motorcycles, in particular Touring motorcycles with our first new engine and design in 18 years and the benefits in terms of power, acceleration, the suspension, heat management, and you can go down the list in vibration and so on and so forth, we believe we've added significantly more value to the motorcycles than the pricing that we've taken. So we're confident with that pricing, and we've enjoyed the ability to price our motorcycles for the last several years. And we feel good about where we're at with this price increase moving into our 2017 Model Year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones. So, I guess, I just wanted to delve more into the guidance a little bit. And I recognize you don't normally give what you're forecasting for retail, but the inventories in the U.S. are up almost 10,000 units. You're saying it's going to be flat by year end and even the low end of the shipment guidance is only a reduction of 4. So, I was wondering if you could help us square that. And then second would be on those cuts and those savings, I just want to make sure, are those being - you said reinvested to protect margin. Is that different from the actions you took earlier this year, which were to - actually in the $70 million, which was more to try to stimulate demand? I guess, I just want to get a better understanding how you're thinking you are going to reinvest that in the business? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Joe. With regards to overall guidance, 264,000 to 269,000 units, we are confident. Third quarter was a tough quarter for us, certainly lower than what we had expected, but still confident in hitting our guidance. And you're absolutely right, inventory was up 9,700 units, much higher than we would like at this point in the year, but in line with what we saw in the second quarter. Second quarter, we were up about 8,600 units and put more inventory in the system because of the ERP implementation that we did. We\u2019d hope to burn off more of that inventory over the third quarter. That didn't happen. But we did not take - as Matt had mentioned upfront, we did not take the actions of reducing production at that time because of the fact that we've got our new Model Year 2017 motorcycles out. And to get worldwide dealer fill, it was important that we continued to produce. ","So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we are committed to bringing inventories in line with prior year levels at the end of the year. And that will happen in two ways, Joe; one, we expect retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, driven by several things, the Milwaukee-Eight engine; the demand-driving investments that we're making, which have been very effective; the dealer expansion, I believe in the fourth quarter, we got 16 dealerships opening. And as far as I remember, that's the most we've ever opened in a quarter. So that will help benefit it. And then finally, lapping the very soft industry on a year-ago basis. So, retail sales growth. The other piece is we will be taking production down in the fourth quarter. We are absolutely completely committed to managing supply in-line with demand and expect to be flat on a year-over-year basis. ","Your second question, Joe, is with regards to the savings. Again, Sharon had asked about $30 million to $35 million of savings, and we will use that again to protect our margins into the future. We\u2019ll continue to invest at very high levels of marketing spend, and it will also make sure that in a slower growth environment, we're a little bit more defensive and protective of those margins. And we're looking to maintain them as we move into 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache","Thanks. Just first a point of clarification, I think you said that your operating margin guidance includes the charge. Just want to make sure whether you misspoke and clarifying. I think you were just saying that the $30 million to $35 million SG&A and presumably also the $74 million of nonrecurrence of manufacturing inefficiencies, that those are available for you to protect margin despite higher spending in other areas?","John Olin","Okay, Rod. Operating income that we provided for this year, 2016, will include a charge of $20 million to $25 million. So, after we spend the $20 million to $25 million onetime expense on employee-related mainly costs, we will still be within our guidance of 15% to 16% operating margin for 2016. Also, benefiting 2016 operating margin would be the fact that we expect manufacturing expense to be favorable. So again, through the first three quarters of this year, we had significant unfavorability in manufacturing expense, driven by two huge initiatives, the ERP implementation and our first new engine in 18 years. They will provide benefits over the next decade, and moving forward, were quite expensive putting in. And with that, in the fourth quarter, we would expect manufacturing favorability, which will also add to our margin benefit - our operating margin guidance of 15% to 16%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. This is for Matt. Matt, you made a big decision at the start of this year to reallocate $70 million in funds in order to drive demand. I'm curious what you think worked, what didn't work and what changes you might consider for next year?","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Craig. By and large, we're actually very pleased with all of the investments that we made. In particular, you can see the point about the cadence and impact of new products with the Milwaukee-Eight and I would say that, that's the leading edge of stepping up the focus of our product development investments to have that reach and impact. The comments that I made about Riding Academy, and in general, the whole initiative of ridership in the United States and the role that the Riding Academy plays in bringing new people into the sport, in particular to our brand and to our dealership, we're very pleased with those 52,000 new riders that we've trained. And the other - I guess, the third big hitter is access through enhanced distribution and the dealers. We have added year-to-date 20 and expected 16 in the fourth quarter, helps us with our reach internationally. So those to me are the big hitters. In general, the envelope around it is just making sure that we increase awareness of the brand and of the products along the way. ","All of those have gone really well according to our expectations. Obviously, we learn with everything we do, and we continue to dial in our efforts going forward. In particular, Riding Academy is going to continue to be a high leverage asset for us, how do we make sure that the 52,000 people are the right kinds of new riders that have a long life with us and are going through the class and are high-yield riders coming out the other side and working with our dealers to both expand the number of them that offer the class, as well as the number of classes they are able to offer and the conversion rate of everybody that goes through it is going to be a key focus of Riding Academy going forward. And we'll continue to dial in everything that we're doing, learn from everything that we're doing, as well as exploring new opportunities as they emerge to drive demand for the products and for the brand. So thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. You mentioned that retail sales were up about 5% in September. I think you were referring to U.S. And I'm just wondering also how you think that's going to progress in the fourth quarter? Would you expect to ramp up as the awareness of the new model increases, or would you expect kind of a steady state?","John Olin","Thanks, Greg. So we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing from our Model Year 2017 motorcycles driven by certainly the Milwaukee-Eight engine. Matter of fact is you look at the beginning of the quarter and July and August, we saw the same run rate from the industry, down about 9%. Our sales were down about the same amount, a little bit more and really turned around in the month of September, up 5% United States, also up pretty strong at EMEA. Those are the two markets that we had distribution of our Model Year 2017 motorcycles in. They just started reaching our Asia-Pacific region very late in the quarter. ","So we expect certainly a lift from the new product in the fourth quarter in those markets, as well as in Latin America. They will arrive even later into the fourth quarter. But the reception has been absolutely fantastic. And so the lift that we're seeing in September, we do believe it will be sustainable in the fourth quarter and drive increased retail sales in the United States, as well as around the world with regards to that. Also had a big impact in terms of market share in the U.S and actually brought the industry to near flat for the month of September. So not only is it driving our sales, but really having an impact on industry sales as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of staying on that topic, John, on the up 5% in September, I was just wondering was that mostly driven by the bikes with the new engines, or was it driven by the entire new model line. And then also, can you just help us understand what that comped against? It was my understanding that September 2015 retail registrations were down quite a bit. So, I'm just trying to understand the benefit of an easy comp versus the accelerated sales from the new bikes? And that's kind of it.","John Olin","Thanks, Felicia. Felicia, I cannot remember what the month of September year ago was. The overall quarter for Harley-Davidson was down 2.5%. And I just don't recall the cadence by month. And maybe Amy could help out with that. When you ask about - the driver in the month of September was largely our Touring motorcycles. Touring motorcycles were up double digit, and United States represents a little over 50% of our sales in the U.S. So that was the biggest driver. The other categories, we continue to see the Cruisers doing well with the S models. But the biggest driver in the month of September certainly was the Touring bikes with the Milwaukee-Eight engine.","Operator","Our next question comes from the lines of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I maybe wanted to rephrase a previous question, but essentially, it would appear that retail was worse than you expected in the third quarter. Inventories are higher as we exit the third quarter. Ultimately, shipments are towards the - or at the low end of what you guided, and yet your full year guidance is unchanged. So, I guess, the implication is you're more optimistic about the fourth quarter for us to still be able to get to those same numbers. And I guess, second question sort of in the context of the color you gave on September, the math would seem to suggest that the fourth quarter needs to be even better than that 5% growth just to get to the low end of the guidance and probably more like double digits to get to the midpoint. Have your - even within your guidance, are you towards the lower end of those numbers, help us square how third quarter was so much worse than you thought and now you're still maintaining the guidance?","John Olin","Thanks, James. So number 1 is we certainly do expect a strong and growing retail sales in the fourth quarter. But, James, we do not need the level of growth that you stated. I think you said mid-single digits to high or significantly higher than what we did in the month of September. That is not accurate. So two things you need to go back and look at is when you look at the retail sales and try to equate them to wholesale shipments, the base of those 2 numbers starting the year were different off of a couple of thousand units. And while we'll maintain inventories flat on a year-over-year basis in the United States, we do expect inventory growth in our international markets. We will be adding 36 new dealerships, and we will certainly need inventory to help support that growth, which is about a 5% increase in our international dealerships. ","So with those two things included in the computation, it is much less than needed, much less to hold the guidance into come in at the low end or the high end of the guidance for the full year guidance. But again, we do feel very good about the momentum that we've got coming out of the month of September and the reaction to our new product from the media, our dealers and customers around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning. John, you talked about manufacturing being favorable to the fourth quarter gross margins, but you also got a manufacturing curtailment you talked of as well? Can you just help us maybe unpack that number a little bit and help us understand some of the moving parts to get you to that, since it will be favorable? And then just quickly, if you could talk about your 9,700 units of inventory, how much of that's model 2016 versus model 2017?","John Olin","All right. Thanks, David. Yes, with regards to the manufacturing expense, we have certainly had a tremendous amount of startup cost going on and lower run rates. As we exited the third quarter, number 1 is the ERP system came up flawlessly as did the cutover to the new engine. We spent a lot of money on training our workforce and making sure that things went well. As we exited the third quarter, the plants were up and running at speed, and that will be the biggest driver of our year-over-year improvement from last year. We still will have lower production. So, we'll have a headwind in overall manufacturing expense on lost absorption. But given the running of the plant and the speed that we're at, we would expect that manufacturing expense to be favorable in the fourth quarter. ","The second question that you asked, David, was of the 9,700 units of higher inventory, what percentage is of carryover motorcycles. I do not know the absolute percentage of that. And it really - it's hard to tell, because that's just the increase in inventory. What I can tell you is Model Year 2016 carryover inventory is a much bigger percentage of the total inventory that we have in the system than we would like at this point, and it is higher than what we had on a year-over-year basis. The dealers are doing a very good job of burning through that carryover. But it is, no doubt, higher than we want, and that is the appropriate level. ","Remember, coming into the year, we were producing [indiscernible] pull back and as much production as we could in the second quarter. We are cutting over to a new model year. And so we ended up with higher overall inventories. We are helping the dealers. Our dealers are doing a good job burning through the inventory, and we are helping them. We've got a three-pronged approach in the marketplace right now to help out with that. Two are more consumer-focused, one is more dealer-focused. Of the two consumer-focused programs, one is financing, finance offers, which we have on some of the models that we're more long on. I believe that's four Touring models and one Dyna model. And what that is, is 1.99% no money down offer for top tier. ","Significantly less coverage than we had a year ago, so less, but an opportunity to help our customers and dealers there. And then secondly is winter warranty program for our customers. This is not a new program to Harley-Davidson, but we didn't have it - we didn't offer it in the last couple of years. What that does, David, is any for our customers that buy a motorcycle in the United States in the winter months will get that added on to their warranty coverage. So effectively, everyone that buys a motorcycle between now and April 1, their warranty - two-year warranty will start effectively April 1, so a consumer incentive there. ","And then the final one is, is that a common practice among our dealers is to trade motorcycles, to get the right color with a long on one model and short on another. They do a lot of trading. What we've done is for carryover 2016 models, we will help defray the cost of that trading that goes on. And so we hope to encourage and facilitate getting the right motorcycles to the right dealers at the right time to move through as much of the carryover inventory as quickly as we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Adam Jonas","Thanks. Just one follow-up. All other questions have been answered, thank you. Can you remind us what percentage of your workers in the U.S. are under temporary contracts and any other details around that?","John Olin","In temporary contract? What exactly do you mean, Adam?","Adam Jonas","Not full time, more flexible contracts, where the cost of separation might be different, say, from a permanent hire or full-time worker?","John Olin","So, there's two avenues to that. There are hourly workers. And last quarter, we announced layoff of a couple of hundred hourly folks. And most of those - we've got a fair amount of casual workers in the workforce, and certainty, we look to lay those off - those folks off first. But we did lay off a couple hundred of our employees. In terms of that workforce, during surge periods, we can surge up to 30%. But in any given period of time, it's much less in terms of casual workforce in the hourly ranks. In terms of on salaried side, I don't know what the percentage is, Adam. But as we look to become leaner and more focused, we will lose some of the contingent workforce that we have working here. And unfortunately, we will also lose some of our full-time employees.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You guys talk quite a bit about uncertainty in the economic environment. And with parts and accessories down, I'm curious whether you guys think maybe that consumers are either delaying the corresponding purchases to their bike purchase, or are they foregoing them and they prefer to spend the money just on the bikes? And then second, factory inventory was down pretty well year-over-year. Can you tell us about where you think that might be going by year end? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Jaime. Parts and accessories and general merchandise were both soft during the quarter. P&A was down, I believe, 8.3% and general merchandise 5.5%. But, Jaime, you also have to look at that in context of kind of what they track to. Our overall shipments were down 9.1%. And some of our parts and accessories business tracks pretty well with shipments, as dealers get motorcycles in and make changes to them. And then they also both track pretty well to retail sales as well, which on a worldwide basis was down 4.5% and 7% in the United States. ","So when you look at both P&A and general merchandise, they're down, kind of straddling between what we were down in retail for the quarter in wholesale. So on a year-to-date basis, parts and accessories, I think, is down about 2.5%. And we've got retail sales down about that same amount, 1.9%. So on a year-to-date basis, they're tracking pretty much what we've seen in that relationship historically. I\u2019m sorry. Jaime, the second question was with regards to overall inventory. If you remember, going back to the fourth quarter, we had inventory up quite significantly. Matter of fact, it was up about 33%, and that was to get a quick start in supporting the marketing spending that we were doing in the first quarter. ","And at that time, we said we would burn that inventory off throughout the year and each year - each periods come down. And I'm certainly happy to say that in the third quarter, overall inventory was down about $40 million, driven largely by finished goods inventory, partially offset by a little bit of rise in parts and accessories and general merchandise. And so overall inventory is down about 9%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect overall inventories to be down as well on a year-end basis.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Beckel for Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","David Beckel","Hi thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I have a bit of a high-level question that sort of affects not only this year but next. I had a question, if you had to itemize the sort of negative drivers that you've experienced throughout the industry for this year, what have been the most significant factors affecting U.S. sales? Because it seems like the trend is decidedly departed from the last 3 to 4 years. And following on that, to what extent do you see the current year's weakness as being more cyclical or secular in nature? And a quick follow-up. You mentioned you're going to be helping defray the cost of trading of used bikes between dealers. I was just curious what exactly or the extent to which those costs are material or nor or any additional detail you could provide there? Thanks.","John Olin","All right. Thank you, David. So when we look at the year and the negative drivers are all based on the industry, David. Market share, we couldn't be more pleased with. Again, coming into the year, our direct objective was to stabilize market share. On a year-to-date basis, market share is up 0.8%. And even when you look at the third quarter, market share was flat. But if you peel back a little bit further than that in the categories that we compete in, in the third quarter, that being Touring large cruisers and small cruisers, our market share was up quite significantly, up a full percentage point in those markets. And we gained market share in all three segments. So, we're competing extremely well without discounting. And that is the equity spending that we're going on brand-building activities Matt had talked a little bit about before. ","So that aspect is going very well, going better than what we had expected. What the negative drivers are is clearly around the industry. And we've seen the industry that's performed very well over the last 5 years up through 2015, a CAGR of 2.9%. And we got into this year and we had about a percentage point increase in the first quarter. And then again toward the end of April, things really started to fall out. When you look at what's driving the industry, one is up through three quarters is lapping very strong year ago numbers. On a year-to-date basis, the industry was up about 6-point-something percent, and that was driven by the onset of discounting. So last year was the first benefit that the competition got from significant price reductions. ","So we are facing that headwind. That will start to reverse, David, in the fourth quarter as a year-ago's fourth quarter comp is much easier and actually was down almost 4%. So that we start to see reversing. The second big driver is the weak oil-dependent sales. And this is again an overall industry problem. We've talked about our numbers. And the last three quarters leading up to the third quarter, we've seen that down about 10%. So that's been a significant drag on the industry. Now in the third quarter, we actually saw that accelerate. Certainly disappointed with that, but we saw that increase to a level of about, well, 15% down in oil-dependent areas in the quarter. The industry also saw an acceleration of that number. ","So when you talk about going forward, how does that continue, anyone's guess in the short term, but at some point when that plateaus, we'll have a lower base and be able to grow off of that. And then the third one is soft used values, which the industry has experienced for the last several quarters. Again, we've talked about the bikes that go through our dealer network, which is about a third of the used bikes. Used bike prices held up very well through the third quarter of 2015. And over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen some softness in used bikes as well as the industry. Our bikes continue to hold its value better than the industry by far, but we are seeing used bike values fall. That puts a short-term headwind and new bike sales. ","Long term, it's not necessarily a bad thing, and that does bring a lot of new people into the industry. And a matter of fact for Harley-Davidson, the vast majority of new people coming into the brand come in on used motorcycles. So there's certainly some positive to that. But the industry will work through that softness, and we would expect that to stabilize at some point in the future. The second question that you asked, David, was with regards to trading of motorcycles between dealers. And you had used the term 'used' in describing that. What we are doing to move Model Year 2016 carryover motorcycles are just for new motorcycles, have nothing to do with used. Matter of fact, there was a report out last week that talked about change in used strategy, and I think there was some confusion with regards to what we're doing on Model Year 2016 carryover, new motorcycles to move them, help our dealers move them, which includes facilitating and defraying the cost of trading versus anything to do with used. So, I want to make that clarification.","Operator","We have time for one last question. And our last question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joe Altobello","Great, thanks guys. Good morning. First, I was just trying to get a sense for how the finance promotions that you guys ran this quarter compared to last quarter and in particular how that might have impacted the month of September, given the pretty strong retail number. And then secondly, just a quick housekeeping item. Could you remind us how much of the manufacturing costs this year are nonrecurring for next year? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Joe. The finance promotions on a quarter-to-quarter basis are down quite significantly in 2016 versus 2015. 2015, we were running deeper offers at 0.99% and much broader across our model lineup. Remember, 2015 was the first year and the first impact that we were feeling of the significant discounting, which was currency-driven by the competition. And we did more finance offers last year than we did this year in general. And the spending is down quite significantly on a year-over-year basis. So when we talk about some of the things that we're doing to help with regards to that is financing is actually lower on a year-over-year basis, but we are very focused on helping move some of those models that we are long in. Manufacturing cost?","Matt Levatich","Yes, when we look at overall manufacturing expense line of our gross margin, we have seen a significant amount of cost over the 3 quarters. A significant portion of those are driven by the investments that we're making in ERP system and all the retooling and training that we've done to bring the Milwaukee-Eight to market. There is also other costs in there, lost absorption. Production is down on a year-over-year basis as well as in the second quarter, we had a fair amount of obsolescence as we tried to pull back just before the new Model Year came out. So we would expect the majority of those not to repeat next year. And again, as I had mentioned, that number will become smaller, because we will be favorable on manufacturing expense in the fourth quarter.","Amy Giuffre","Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, Matt.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. Amy Giuffre, you may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, and welcome to Harley-Davidson's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. The audio for today's call is being webcast on harley-davidson.com and the supporting slides can be accessed on our website by clicking on Company, Investor Relations, then Events and Presentations.","This morning Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund will provide their perspective on the quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","With that let\u2019s get started, Keith.","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As we noted in today\u2019s earnings release Harley-Davidson delivered gains on many fronts in the first quarter with motorcycle shipments up 7.3%, consolidated revenue up nearly 10% and diluted earnings per share up 22.2%. Dealer new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales were up 5.8% globally with increases of 10.9% internationally, and 3% in the U.S. Our performance reflects the hard work in contributions and employees at every level of our organization as well as the outstanding efforts of our dealers and our suppliers.","Everyone is focused each and everyday on continuous improvements throughout the organization to deliver outstanding experiences to our customers. In our production operations, we increased the level of first quarter Surge Production in the plants from the year-ago period and improved our Surge efficiencies. Through Surge, we continued to improve our ability to produce the right mix of motorcycles and to get them to the right customers at the right time. Motorcycles like the highly popular project Rushmore touring models which again performed extremely well.","We also know with the recent availability of Polk data for 2013, the one of the Rushmore bikes, the Harley-Davidson Street Glide Special was the best selling new motorcycle model in America last year. And for the record, as long as we are talking about best sellers, our Custom Cruiser Harley-Davidson Breakout was the Number 2 best-selling model in America in 2013.","On another major new product front, we\u2019ve recently began shipping the first Harley-Davidson Street 750 and Street 500 motorcycles, the milestone in our strategy to further expand our reach with young adults globally. The Street 750 got off to a strong start in India with high consumer interest has showroom display and demo motorcycles hit the dealerships. In the U.S., the first Street 500s went into the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy Fleets at our dealerships. We will continue to fill the Riding Academy pool and then look forward to shipping both the Street 750 and 500 for U.S. retail sales late in the second quarter. And we will begin shipment of the Street 750 for retail in Italy, Spain and Portugal in the next several weeks.","In other product news, we launched two more new models in early March, the Low Rider and the SuperLow 1200T. The Low Rider was the original Custom Cruiser when it was first introduced in 1977. And in its return with today\u2019s advancements and performance, it expands Harley-Davidson\u2019s leadership of the category.","The SuperLow 1200T is targeted for a customer who wants great touring features but on the motorcycle that is smaller and lighter than our Big Twin touring models. And what is even more exciting is that as we look down the road, there is a lot more ahead, other great new motorcycles in our world-class product development pipeline to further grow our leadership among core and outreach customers in the U.S. and globally.","As detailed in today\u2019s earnings release, not only was Harley-Davidson the Number 1 seller of new on-road motorcycles to U.S. outreach and core customers for the six straight year in 2013, we drove our market share in each of these segments according to Polk new motorcycle registration data from IHS Automotive. Clearly, the entire team is doing a great job of brining new riders into the Harley-Davidson family even as we grow sales to core customers.","As we entered the prime selling season in many of our key markets, we are excited about the rest of the year and we know that our dealers are too. We got off to a great start in the first quarter and believe we are well positioned to leverage the many opportunities we see in the market place globally. So thanks for your investment in Harley-Davidson and thanks again for joining the call today. And now I\u2019m going to turn it over to John Olin with details on the quarter.","John A. Olin","","Thanks Keith and good morning everyone, I\u2019ll review the first quarter financial results starting on Slide 12. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 9.9% to $1.73 billion. Our first quarter net income improved a $265.9 million, an increase of $41.8 million or 18.6%. Similarly diluted earnings per share rose to $1.21 per share up 22.2% from the year ago quarter. Operating income from the Motorcycle segment was $347.7 million, up 25.6% compared to last year's first quarter. The strong increase to Motorcycle business was driven by 11.1% increase in revenue behind a 7.3% increase in shipments.","Motorcycle segment operating income also benefited from a higher gross margin percent, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A spending. As expected, operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was down behind a higher provision for retail motorcycle loan losses. Also during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense largely offset by a higher tax rate. We're pleased with our first quarter financial results and look forward to the rest of the year.","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 13. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 5.8% during the first quarter, driven by increases in both the U.S. and international markets. For the quarter, worldwide retail sales tracked below our expectation driven by very difficult weather conditions in the U.S. which we believe will primarily impact the timing of sales between the first and second quarters. We remain confident in our full year shipment expectations.","Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 14. Retail sales in the U.S. were up 3% in the first quarter. Even with the year-over-year increase, we believe U.S. retail sales in the first quarter were adversely impacted by two factors. First as we anticipated, the absence of the popular Road Glide models in the 2014 model year continued to impact year-over-year sales results.","Road Glide represented about 10% of the U.S. retail sales in the first quarter of 2013. And second, we believe that extremely difficult weather conditions across the Eastern 2\/3 has adversely impacted the timing of retail sales. We believe underlying demand for our model year 2014 motorcycles is strong, in particular demand for Project Rushmore touring motorcycles.","In fact, overall Touring retail sales were up year-over-year despite the absence of Road Glide models this quarter. Street 500 motorcycles began shipping in late Q1 for dealer use in U.S. rider training.","There is great dealer and customer excitement for our new street models. We expect street motorcycles to be available in the U.S for consumer sales beginning in late Q2. Finally as Keith noted, we received a strong reception to last month\u2019s mid-model year introductions of yet another two models, the Dyna Low Rider and the Sportster Custom 1203 model.","We had strong market share of 56.0% in the first quarter. Market share was roughly flat on year-over-year basis despite absence of Road Glide. U.S. dealer retail inventory was approximately 750 motorcycles at the end of Q1 compared to the same quarter last year. We are comfortable with the inventory levels at the end of the Q1 and remain committed to aggressive managing supply inline with demand. We continue to expect U.S year-end retail inventory to be up from 2013 levels driven primarily by the addition of the new street models.","On Slide 15, you will see retail sales in our international markets grew 10.9% in the first quarter, and in our EMEA region Q1 retail sales were up 8.2% driven by growth across most of the European countries. This increase was aided by favorable year-over-year weather comparisons across most of Europe. Emerging markets within EMEA region continued to grow, reflecting our investment in the distribution network. In the first quarter, our 601+cc market share in Europe was 11.3% down 0.1 percentage points versus the same period last year.","In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 25% in the first quarter, driven by growth in Japan, spurred by a consumption tax increase that went into effect on April 1st of this year. And which we believe pulled forward some sales into the first quarter. Emerging markets within the region were also up double digits during the quarter. Latin America region retail sales were up 8.9% in the quarter as a result of growth in both Brazil and Mexico.","Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 2.4% in the first quarter which we believe is due to unusually harsh weather in that market. As we have discussed, we have been very focused on investing in our international businesses. Since 2009, we have targeted 100 to 150 international new dealer points through 2014. And since 2009, we have opened 120 with two-thirds being in emerging markets.","On Slide 16, you\u2019ll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motor cycles in the quarter were up 7.3% compared to last year. First quarter shipments finished toward high-end of our expected shipment range of 76,500 to 81,500 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.2 percentage points from the prior year as we surged to meet expected spring demand for our new project Rushmore Touring motorcycles.","Also during the quarter, shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 1 percentage point in part driven by the initial shipments of our new Street motorcycles. We will continue to ramp up Street motorcycle production through Q2 and be up to speed during the second half of the year.","On Slide 17, you\u2019ll see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment was up 11.1% in the first quarter, behind a 7.3% increase in shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $836 from the prior year primarily driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact. On average, our key currencies in the first quarter were weaker against the U.S dollar by approximately 3% compared to 2013.","Parts and accessories sales were up 7.7% in the first quarter and general merchandize sales were down 11.1% as a result in the shift of promotions from Q1 of last year to Q2 of this year and lapping the 110th anniversary apparel and accessories sales in Q1 of 2013.","On Slide 18, you\u2019ll see gross margin in the quarter was 37.7% which was up 1.0 percentage points compared to last year. Volume, price, mix, currency, raw materials and manufacturing were all favorable for the quarter. During the quarter, mix was $17.2 million favorable behind a much higher mix of touring motorcycles compared to 2013. Looking forward, we expect mix will become unfavorable in the second half of the year as Street production increases.","Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenue in the first quarter as a result of a sizable evaluation of the Yen, the Brazilian Real and the Australian Dollar on a year-over-year basis. However, despite the unfavorable impact of revenue, foreign currency exchange positively impacted gross margin by $5.2 million or approximately 0.6 percentage points of gross margin. The positive impact was driven by a favorable balance sheet revaluation as currencies rebounded within the first quarter of 2014.","Manufacturing costs in Q1 reflect the benefits from increased year-over-year production and restructuring savings compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. However, manufacturing costs were adversely impacted by startup costs associated with the launch of our new Street platform of motorcycles, which are being produced in Kansas City and India. We expect the startup costs for Street to continue into the second quarter.","Q1 gross margin percentage exceeded our expectations. We originally expect the gross margin to be down slightly versus last year as a result of Street platform startup costs, as well as unfavorable currency exchange. While Street startup costs did adversely impact gross margin, our plants outperformed our expectations for seasonal surge ramp-up costs and foreign currency exchange significantly exceeded our expectations as we anticipated it would be a headwind to Q1 gross margin percent rather than a strong benefit.","On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue in the first quarter was 22.1%, up 2.5 percentage points compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Operating income of $347.7 million for the quarter was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and the absence of restructuring expense, partially offset by higher SG&A spending. We\u2019re very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in the first quarter. Going forward we will remain intensely focused on improving our cost structure and managing the business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable.","Now moving on to our financial services segment on Slide 20. In the first quarter HDFS\u2019 operating profit of $63.2 million was $8.3 million or 11.7% lower than last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were; first, net interest income was unfavorable $0.9 million driven by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition, second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable by $6.3 million due to higher retail credit losses and increase in the reserve rate and growth in retail receivables. As expected, the higher credit losses were impacted by lower recovery values of repossessed cycles following the launch of Rushmore models last fall and changing consumer behavior, and finally, the provision for wholesale credit losses was unfavorable by $1.1 million.","Going forward, we continue to expect pressure on HDFS\u2019 operating income as a result of modestly higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increase in competition and higher year-over-year borrowing costs.","Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS\u2019 operations on Slide 21. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John and good morning. During the first quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 19.3% or $99 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year new retail motorcycle sales and a 6.2 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the first quarter compared to last year.","For the first quarter, HDFS retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sold in the U.S. increased to 52% compared to 45.8% in 2013. The primary drivers of the year-over-year market share gain was a strong sales of touring motorcycles and the pricing changes in the prime segment, which were initiated in the second quarter last year in response to increasing competition.","Finance receivables outstanding increased 6.7% compared to a year ago driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. In the first quarter, between 75% and 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime.","Moving onto credit performance on Slide 22, the 30 day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans as of March 31, 2014 was 2.66% or 26 basis points lower in 2013. This is the second lowest first quarter delinquency percentage for each year past in the last 13 years. Annual retail credit losses increased by 24 basis points to 1.33% compared to 2013 driven by higher losses due to lower recovery values on repossess motorcycles following the launch of our Project RUSHMORE motorcycles last fall. We expect this impact to continue through the first half of this year.","Additionally the increase in credit losses also resulted from change in consumer behavior and lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged-off in prior years. During the first quarter, HDFS, continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, deliver solid credit performance and contributes strong profitability. And we remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Now let me turn it back to John.","John A. Olin","","Thanks. And now, let\u2019s take a look at, cash and liquidity on Slide 23. You will see at the end of the quarter we had $1.03 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition we had nearly $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have intent to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","During the first quarter, we increased the dividend by 31% and we repurchased 1.2 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $76.6 million. Our Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares which increased our authorization to 28.1 million of shares as of the end of the quarter. We also paid-off a $303 million of Harley-Davidson, Inc. high interest debt and HDFS $820 million to Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Earlier this month, HDFS successfully completed an $850 million asset securitization transaction at a weighted average interest rate of 0.93%. As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through increasing dividends at share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance values for our shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 24. I\u2019d like to highlight two items; first, with regards to operating cash flow we generate an operating cash of $203.6 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was up $312 million from last year primarily driven by the lapping of last year\u2019s pension contribution of $175 million, lower working capital and increased earnings.","And second, first quarter tax rate was 35.0% compared to 33.8% in the year-ago period, this reflects the benefit of last year\u2019s first quarter rate from retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for both 2013 and 2012.","On Slide 25, you will see overall expectations for the quarter ahead. In 2014, we continue to expect to ship 279,000 to 284,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 7% to 9% from 2013 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson is strong.","We expect shipment growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand; great model year 2014 and 2015 motorcycles, the introduction of the new Street motorcycles, which we estimate to ship between 7,000 and 10,000 units continuing outreach momentum in the U.S. and international expansion.","During the second quarter we expect to ship between 92,000 and 97,000 motorcycles, up approximately 8.5% to 14.5% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter shipments of 84,606 motorcycles. We continue to believe 2014 operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 17.5% and 18.5%, up from 16.6% in 2013. We believe 2014 operating margin will benefit from a modest increase in gross margin and from SG&A falling as the percent of revenue.","Looking at SG&A, we continue to expect a little increase in 2014 as we invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect that will decline as a percent of revenue as we leverage our current SG&A spending.","For HDFS, we continue to expect operating income will be down modestly in 2014 compared to 2013. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be between $215 million and $235 million. Finally, we continue to expect our full year 2014 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%.","So, to recap, we are certainly pleased with our first quarter results and key accomplishments throughout the quarter. We successfully increased sales, gross margin, operating margin, which resulted in a 22.2% increase in diluted earnings per share, initiated Surge manufacturing at our Kansas City plant, shipped the first all new Street motorcycles, launched two additional 2014 models; the Low Rider and Custom 1200T and delivered shareholder value to a 31% dividend increase and repurchase of $77 million of company shares.","We\u2019re excited about 2014; we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our gross strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.","Thank you, for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now let\u2019s take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is open.","Tim A. Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and congratulations on a good execution gentlemen and the whole team.","Keith E. Wandell","Thanks Tim.","Tim A. Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Couple of items here. I guess if worldwide was still in the mix right now would it be fair to say that your market share would be up that 9% or 10% or would there be say some other dynamics that are going on there. And then John more from a housekeeping perspective, can you detail out the Street first quarter start-up cost and then also just any inefficiency cost beyond the Street?","Keith E. Wandell","Yes, thanks Tim. That again as we\u2019ve talked about worldwide is an extremely popular couple of models and in Q1 of 2013 represented 10% of our sales. So we also believe these customers are some of our most loyal to on the bike they ride, and the worldwide is very different in the way (indiscernible), the way it looks and the way it rides on the road. So we do believe those folks are not in the market at this point and if they where we certainly believe our market share would be a fair amount higher. And I\u2019m certainly that is the largest driver of our market share. Now having said that Tim, market share we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with at 56% largely flat with the absence of Road Glide.","We also got to remember that a year-ago market share was up 2.4% and the reason that was so high, but the gain was that we increased availability and that was the first time and probably eight to ten quarters that we were able to get more motorcycles at the market. So not only do we not have that, we certainly had a tough comp in terms of market share. And then increased competition, especially in the Performance segment was strong in the first quarter. We\u2019ve seen the Performance segment be down for the last five years and I think that\u2019s a tremendous sign for the industry.","So with all those things and those headwinds against market share, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with delivering 56% market share for the quarter. The second question that you asked Tim was on was on Street startup costs. For the quarter, Street startup costs were in the $4 million range and again we\u2019ve never started up our product in two factories before and this will be done, I mean in Kansas City and in India. And also not only in India, we\u2019re starting up Street but we\u2019re starting up our manufacturing operations, which means we\u2019ll be fabricating in that plan. So we got a lot going on with Street. The start-up is going very well. We expect start-up costs of about the same amount to a little bit more in the second quarter.","And let me give you a quick recap as to where we are at in terms of Street. We did shipments in the first quarter, probably we should think about that in terms of 100s versus anything else that will continue to build through the second quarter and will be up the speed in the back half of the year. And as we mentioned were about halfway filled in our Rider Academy that will continue on into the second quarter at which time we\u2019ll switch over and start to provide units for sale our customers in the U.S. Right now, we\u2019re shipping in India and by the end of the second quarter we\u2019ll start shipping to Southern Europe. So I\u2019m very excited about Street model.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Joe Hovorka from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Joseph D. Hovorka \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks guys. Just one quick question on the Rider's Edge, Rider\u2019s Advantage Program. When we ship a Street is it tagged and license in the state, does that show there is a retail sale or does it not show up as a retail sale.","Keith E. Wandell","Good question, Joe. The bikes that we ship into the Rider Academy will reflect in the quarter as a retail sale.","Joseph D. Hovorka \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. It will, okay.","Keith E. Wandell","Yes it well.","Joseph D. Hovorka \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Hardiman from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","James L. Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call and congrats on a great quarter. I guess, first the housekeeping and then I guess a bigger picture question. Just looking at the numbers in the press release. It looks like your retail was up 3%, the industry was up 1%. I think based on what you do in the release, but then you\u2019re seeing a flat market share. And then conversely, Europe you guys were up about 9%. In the release, it industry was up 25% or are there sort of different numbers being used there.","And then I guess just a bigger picture question in terms of market share. At your big Analyst Day last year, you talked about sort of the longer-term outlook losing a little bit of share. Certainly, the expectation I think is that you\u2019re going to lose share this year given not only the bike that you don\u2019t have, but also the introduction of smaller big competitors Indian most notably. Are we definitely going to see you guys lose share this year or after a pretty strong first quarter do you feel better about sort of where that market share outlook will be? Thanks.","Keith E. Wandell","Thanks, James. Yes, as you noted out the press release and if you go back in any quarter, they never tie out completely. So the process is that we submit along with our competitors, submit retail sales to, in the U.S., the MIC and in Europe there\u2019s various agencies that track it. And the difference that you see is timing and to see a couple of point difference is a not a big deal. The timing in Europe is a little bit bigger than typical, but it is just timing and we\u2019ll see that those numbers workout over the year. And as you look at it on a full year basis, James, versus a quarter, they do get very close, but the same numbers, just timing as to when they\u2019re recorded as a registration versus submitted by the companies.","The second question that you would ask is on market share. We feel very good about overall market share and we expect \u2013 what we said is that we expect headwinds in 2014 largely driven by the absence of Road Glide, which again is a huge part of our volume last year and it won\u2019t there until we reintroduce Road Glide. So we expect those headwinds to continue, but as I had mentioned, couldn\u2019t be more excited about the strength, the underlying strength of the brand that we saw in the first quarter in having a flat market share.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Taking my question as well. I wanted to understand the international strength that we\u2019re seeing, and maybe you could unpack the extent to which it\u2019s been driven by more distribution points, that are same dealer sales at existing dealers or just new products? It\u2019s exceptionally strong number.","Keith E. Wandell","Well, Craig, I think it\u2019s driven by all of them, but let\u2019s take a quick spin around Europe when we look at it. Europe is the second quarter in a row that we\u2019ve seen positive growth after a very difficult couple of years period of time. So we\u2019re certainly very optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing out of Europe. The core European regions or the 16 countries were up 8.8%. Now that is partly driven by favorable weather. They had a very mild winter this year, very much unlike the United States and that was compared to a more rough winter the year before. So that was a hot climate, but what was really exciting about Europe is that was across almost across every country in Europe with the exception of Spain.","So really good growth, two quarters in a row. We\u2019ll continue to work on it, I think the team in Europe has done a wonderful job in driving the brand forward, the new product is being very well received as it is another places in the world. And we continue to add distribution points, when we look at Asia-Pacific, which was up 20.5% and to look into the detail, that was driven by Japan, which was up in the largest market in Asia-Pacific and that was up 33% and that was a lot of volume forward into the first quarter, because of the initiation of a increase in the consumption tax in Japan up three percentage points.","So we would expect that the start that dissipate over time. And when we look at Asia-Pacific going forward, we don\u2019t have any retail sales in there for Street and we are excited about the opportunity for Street in Asia-Pacific through the Indian market.","Keith Wandell","Hey, John this is Keith, I just want to add some Craig, make no mistake about it, the technology that we are introducing in our new bikes is having a major impact in international markets particularly in Europe, and its really I think helping our brand gain momentum and gain strength in those markets.","And finally Latin America was up strong and we didn\u2019t even get the Rushmore or the Street into the marketplace until late in the first quarter. So, overall we feel very good about international, we do have some timing happening in 10.9% increase that you saw on this quarter, but very bullish and what\u2019s happening in our international businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning everybody. Couple of things, one is the pricing and mix obviously were very strong $45 million, $46 million year-over-year. Can you give us some color on how we should be thinking about that maybe size it up for the second quarter, particularly the mix and when you\u2019re looking at the production is the touring retail sales kind of inline at this point with what your shipments percentage is or are you still basically kind of over building on touring to fill in inventory. Then lastly related to that when does the Road Glide come back in, is that something they could benefit this year\u2019s retail sales?","John A. Olin","Thanks Rod. Again, when you look at our gross margin bridge, we had a lot of strength. Every element was positive and certainly in particular pricing in mix. Pricing was up $14 million, and again that\u2019s a 3.5% price increase that we took earlier in the year, but as a percentage of revenue actually pricing was a little bit of a drag as we had anticipated on gross margin percent. When you look at mix, our mix being up $17.2 million, we look at mix three different levels or three different businesses motorcycle, parts and accessories and general merchandise. All three of those were favorable and that doesn\u2019t happen, all that often. And when you take and look at the motorcycle mix, which was the biggest driver, we were favorable in family mix, model mix and geographic mix.","So, very strong quarter on mix, and it also added as a percent of gross margin to the overall quarter. You would ask Rod, what happens as we go forward and we would expect still some strength, good strength in mix in the second quarter behind Rushmore, as it compares to non-Rushmore product right, that will be our fourth quarter of having that in the market. Now that will start to get diluted a little bit, as we ramp up shipments of Street.","And so on the second quarter, we\u2019ll continue to ramp up those shipments and that will start to have an adverse impact, but overall mix, we would expect in the second quarter to be favorable. As you get into the back half two things happen, as we start to lap Rushmore sales against itself and would expect the strong mix gains that we\u2019ve had start to dissipate. And at the same time, we\u2019ll have Street into full production and we do expect in the second half of the year that mix will be unfavorable both on a dollar and a percent basis. And remember when we launched Street, we said it would be 0.5 point dilutive of overall gross margin, you\u2019re not seeing that in the first quarter and you will really start to see that in the back half of the year.","And you would ask about production versus shipments, we are producing full of our Rushmore bikes and they are selling as they are getting to the dealerships. We are not building any inventory in terms of, we are not building much inventory on our entire line, but certainly not building inventory in the field on Rushmore. Again they\u2019re selling very well and we are very pleased at what we are seeing.","And the third question that is with regards to Road Glide and when it\u2019s coming back. I cannot specifically tell you when it\u2019s coming back, I can tell you that it is on plan and everything is going according to plan but as you know, we don\u2019t talk about when a product is coming out. Suffice to say that, we\u2019re very excited about it. It is a big driver of our growth as well as our customers\u2019 desires and that it will come out with the Rushmore features and we\u2019re all excited about it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","John, sometimes you talk about the Sunshine State performance versus the weather impacted states. If you could give us a little bit color on that as well as how retail inventory levels or dealer inventory levels are doing right now?","John A. Olin","Great, Greg. Yes what a quarter, what a winner especially just fitting in the Midwest. As we look at overall weather on the Eastern 2\/3s as we had mentioned certainly had been very difficult and if you kind of break it up into three ranges Greg, and you talk about where weather was significantly worse on a year-over-year basis and certainly the central area where we are at today was one of those record cold up to 90% of Lake Michigan froze. Sales were down considerably and as we exit the third quarter, we still have a couple of regions that are down on a year-over-year basis and that being in the Central and the Northeast regions. Now where we\u2019ve seen weather that is comparable on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019ve seen good growth and where we\u2019ve seen weather considerably better either West, we have seen significant growth in those markets.","And as the weather breaks, we\u2019re starting to see those sales come inline, very tough in the Southeast for the first of January, February. As weather broke down there we saw good sales and now they are up a little bit on a year-over-year basis. So we\u2019re excited about weather evening out and becoming more seasonable and down in the second quarter here.","","Gregory Robert Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick K. Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you very much. Kind of building on an earlier question on slide relating to slide I guess 18, I think if I have this right you said that manufacturing had come in a bit better than what you expected and certainly currency had, I can\u2019t remember if raw materials were better than expected, but it sounds like there is a lot of items here that have come in favorable this quarter. I understand that there are some headwinds as you get into the second half like mix but that\u2019s something that was always anticipated based on your schedule. So just how much upside risk is there to that operating margin guidance or is there some expectation that some of these good guys are going to reverse in subsequent quarters.","John A. Olin","Great, great question let\u2019s take currency for the quarter and as we talked about, we expected gross margin to be down slightly. The biggest difference in driver between what we expected and where we ended up was currency. And we had an unusual quartering currency in that the revenue on a year-over-year basis was down by $10.5 million and that was because of a devaluation from first quarter this year to first quarter last year. And we anticipated that \u2013 what we didn\u2019t anticipate was within the quarter. From the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we saw currencies actually rebound across all four of our major currencies including the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Brazilian real quite significantly, about 3 percentage points. And what that requires is us to re-embark our assets and that drove the favorability. So while we had unfavorable revenue, we actually had favorable profit because of that revaluation gain that we took.","Now, Greg, you asked about what\u2019s going to happen in the future. We still expect currency to be a headwind as we look forward, but it\u2019s hard to tell. If currency stay the way they are that gain will be basically a one-time gain. If currency is devalue again and go back to where they were then perhaps they would \u2013 we\u2019d see that gain reverse itself. So when we look at it, currencies, we\u2019re not completely sure, but we think it\u2019s a headwind. Actually we\u2019ve talked about everything else in terms of manufacturing efficiencies we\u2019re getting out of the plant, be structuring savings. Everything is going according to plan and we\u2019re very pleased as to what we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia R. Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Thanks. Two questions for you. The first is just on the cadence in shipments. I think this is kind of an attempt to discuss a few questions ago. So you explained very clearly banking that you had search of the touring bikes in the first quarter and if you look at historically at your shipment versus sell through, historically there has been a build in the first quarter. But as we all know historical shipment patterns are changing now because of the manufacturing programs that you\u2019ve implemented. So just trying to think about the cadence of shipments versus sell through in the second, third and four quarters. Will they be more even? Is that how we should think about that?","And then my second question is, if you could just comment on the Low Rider and the SuperLow and the reception of those bikes at the dealer show. You talked about how the Sport is going kind of be dilutive in the second half, but just wondering if those bikes sales are offsetting that so much and\/or somewhat and how we should think about the impact of what you launch after the dealer show? Thank you.","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Felicia. The cadence of shipments, all the heavy lifting of moving inventory and basically over the last three years what we did is took where we were that we shipped in 50%, we produce 50% in the first half of the year and the second half, but retail sales were about 60%. Last year we really got over the hump and last year we produced about 60% and shipped about 60% in the first half of the year and that\u2019s in line with our retail sales.","So having said that, Felicia, we don\u2019t expect any big changes in cadence of shipments and takeaway. Now whether it\u2019s always going to bounce things around a little bit, but by and large the pattern should be similar to what we saw last year. We exited last year. In the quarterly inventories we felt very good about. At the end of this year we would expect inventories to go up a little bit because we\u2019ve got the new family of motorcycles in Street.","I want to make one thing clear and to the question that I mentioned before, I was referring to the shipments of Street and the retail sales in terms of year-over-year basis. We are increasing the inventory. Inventories went up. Our overall bikes in the system went up 18,500 units and that\u2019s a seasonal increase. When you look at a year-over-year basis they were up about 750 units. So again in line with what we\u2019re seeing on a cadence basis, but certainly building from a seasonal perspective.","You\u2019d asked about Low Rider and the Super 1200T, the new models that we have launched. When we look at Low Rider, it\u2019s a cruiser motorcycle and it\u2019s got pretty good margins, not as high as on the touring motorcycles, but certainly higher than Sportster. Sportster motorcycle margins are the lowest, and they\u2019re not going to offset what we\u2019re going to see in Street. But overall, they are selling better than what we expected, there are great additions and continue to flank our bikes in the Dyna and the Sportster categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime M. Katz \u2013 Morningstar Research","Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d be curious if you guys would get a little bit more granular on the Asia Pacific region. We've been hearing from some other consumer companies that China is holding up okay, but maybe that Australia has been a little bit weaker, I\u2019m curious what your anecdotes are there. And then also have you updated your thoughts maybe on how cycle capacity affects your longer-term operating margin potential assumptions, just an update on that? Thanks.","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Jaime. When we look at sales across AP, we talked about in the quarter, which is kind of an anomaly with Japan and they are changing their consumption tax. But otherwise our emerging markets in the region which are certainly led by China and India are well under the double-digits, and we are not seeing a big impact. But you got to remember that our businesses there are still pretty small, and we got a lot of distribution opportunity, and don\u2019t think that they are going to be derailed than any great respect because of the economy. When you look at Australia, Australia sales are up. They are more moderate \u2013 in the moderate range, but we are feeling very good about the business there as well, and again, on a year-over-year, basis were up 20%, I think last year we were up 12%. So we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum come out of Asia-Pacific and I expect that to continue as we move forward.","The second question that you asked Jaime was with regards to our flexible manufacturing and what\u2019s the long-term opportunity with regards to that? The biggest part of the long-term opportunity is really matching our sales with \u2013 production with our customer needs and getting much closer to the customer purchase cycle. And with that we will have the right models and the right dealerships at the right time.","I think that\u2019s the biggest opportunity that we\u2019ve got with flexible manufacturing. We are seeing a lot of financial benefits in terms of some of the lower cost, the lower cost of doing it from wage rates to certainly leveraging the assets in the plant during that period of time. But I think the biggest benefit is really us getting much closer to that purchase cycle and making sure the products are there one of our customers want them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hey, good morning. Wondering if you guys grew sales to outreach faster than core in a quarter and if not do you expect that to kick back into effect with the balance of the year with Street and the SuperLow 12? Thanks.","Keith E. Wandell","Thanks, Gerrick. During the quarter, the first quarter actually core sales to core customers grew faster than outreach. If we go back and look at 2012 and 2013, outreach grew at over twice the rate of our core sales, and we expect that to continue into the future and certainly continue this year. However, for the first quarter, we had core growing faster, I think core was up about 4% and outreach was up about 2%, certainly expected given the fact that project Rushmore is a great opportunity for trade-ups of our core customer. Having said that, as Keith had mentioned the Street Glide is a Number 1 selling motorcycle in the nation as well as to our outreach group, but the project Rushmore product is certainly overshared to our core customer.","So having said that, first quarter core grew faster we expect by the end of the year that outreach will have \u2013 will be up growing at a faster pace. And as you had mentioned Gerrick, I\u2019m very much sure that Street is going to help bring that formula back in line.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey everybody. Could you offer a comment on used bike prices, I mean you mentioned for you guys that some of the recovery values are suffering from the introduction of the new technologies that are understandable on the Financial Services side, but overall for the market maybe a comment. And also maybe housekeeping, I noticed a 25% increase in the accounts receivable balance, I was wondering if that was driven by some of the extended cash conversion cycle as you\u2019ve grow the international business more kind of any other driver for that, is that temporary or not? Thanks.","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Adam. What I\u2019ll do is I will take the first quarter. I\u2019m sorry, I will take the second question and then have Larry answer how used bike prices are affecting us? With regards to accounts receivable balance, it is up for a couple of reasons, seasonally as we\u2019re shipping in more products. Number of accounts receivables are international sales. All of our domestic sales are recorded under books of HDFS\u2019 as a finance receivable. But our accounts receivables are international sales, so they are up quite a bit, so that\u2019s driving them to be higher from a seasonal standpoint. Also, we cannot change credit terms in Brazil to help with a growth there. We used to have cash in advance and now we\u2019ve got them on terms like the rest of our international markets. And then foreign currency translation also impacted accounts receivable.","Lawrence G. Hund","And Adam as it relates to used bike prices, as we noted obviously the recovery values were receiving on sales of repossessed motorcycles at auction or down a little bit with the \u2013 after the introduction of the great Rushmore line. Used motorcycle prices at the dealer level are down a little bit, but actually holding up reasonably well. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the rest of the year.","Operator","Your last question comes from James Hardiman from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","James L. Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up, I just want to follow-up on a question Hovorka had earlier in the call, which I thought was a good one. The Street bikes obviously, they are sort of a different animal in terms of how they are being treated, I guess can you give us an idea of what retail would have been up in the absence of those bikes since they are also being treated as retail.","Secondly, are those in the market share numbers? And then thirdly, in terms of inventory, can you talk about what you expect to happen to inventory in the absence of those bikes since \u2013 if I sort of think about this, if it\u2019s a wholesale shipment and a retail sale, does that count as an inventory build. So I just sort of walk through the different components of how we should be looking at the Street bikes since they are a little bit different?","John A. Olin","Okay, James, if I miss any of those, please let me know. With regards to our retail sales, which were up 3% in the United States, there wasn\u2019t any retail sales internationally of Street motorcycle, they started in April. So the 3% the amount that Street would be with that would be very nominal because we didn\u2019t ship out many bikes in the first quarter.","I don\u2019t know what that would be, but it would be very slight. It did not affect our market share numbers at all, number of our market share is 601 plus ccs and the bikes that we are shipping in for training are 500cc so that\u2019s not picked up in market share. Now when we do start to ship the 750cc for consumer use in the United States, they will hit market share but then we haven\u2019t shipped any of those yet.","When we look at inventory and what we said is on a full year basis our year-end inventory, retail inventory we expect it to increase and that increase will be largely driven by Street motorcycles. So we got a dealer fill and in the United States that\u2019s the inventory that I think you are referring to James. We got 700 dealers out there, that will have a inventory so we would expect our inventory to go up because of the new models of Street.","When you look at the other models or the base models prior to Street, we would expect them to grow in relationship to our overall sales i.e. keeping our forward turns constant, we feel very comfortable with the overall inventory level, and we are going to continue to manage it aggressively in line with demand, so we would start to expect that to grow in line with retail sales.","Amy Giuffre","All right, thank you for your time this morning.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Shannon Burns. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. ","Shannon Burns","Good morning, everyone. You can access the slides supporting this call at investor.harley-davidson.com, click the Earnings Materials box in the center of the page. Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation [indiscernible] in this call. Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin. Matt, let's get started.","Matthew Levatich","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everybody. We're pleased that our fourth quarter and full year performance was in line with our expectations and indicates increased business stability, driven by the tremendous efforts of our employees and dealers to inspire riding and navigate the challenges of our dynamic business environment. ","During 2019, we significantly advanced our More Roads plan, investing, building capabilities and achieving milestones, keeping us on track to return to significant growth in 2021. we have a lot to be proud of and much to look forward to. ","More Roads is an important aspect of the total company transformation journey that has been underway for the better part of a decade. We began this transformation with a focus on manufacturing, that includes our recent multiyear manufacturing optimization initiative anchored by the consolidation of our motorcycle assembly plant in Kansas City into our expanded plant in York. The work on this initiative is nearly complete, and we expect annual ongoing savings of approximately $70 million in 2021. John will delve into this more later. ","We've also transformed product development, allowing us to deliver an innovation-led approach with a 30% faster time-to-market, dramatically increasing our capacity and capability to broaden our product portfolio to reach and inspire more people. This includes electric products, motorcycles in new segments and sizes and even e-bicycles. Our front foot approach to innovation is also helping to strengthen our leadership in the Touring and Cruisers segments, leading to a historically high 72.4% market share of those segments in the U.S., up 2.5 percentage points over 2018.","We've delivered industry-first innovations like touring traction control with advanced ABS and H-D Connect, seamlessly linking rider and motorcycle. We're also leading the electrification of motorcycles with class-leading products developed in conjunction with our new team and our EV development center, LiveWire labs in Silicon Valley. Our innovation and growth pursuits under More Roads have also stimulated smart targeted acquisitions like StaCyc, and new collaborations like QJ in China. All of this transformation investment and effort has allowed us to emerge with more flexible, responsive and efficient product processes from design to build; processes we continue to improve and evolve with the changing needs of our customers. ","We are now well into the final transformation phase, a comprehensive overhaul of our marketing and go-to-market capabilities to become a customer-creation company, driving demand and delivering growth by shaping our place in markets around the globe. We are becoming a company that excels and exists to not only build great bikes, but to build riders. ","This focuses us beyond simply what someone is riding to why people ride, and how we can use our insights to deliver targeted experiences and increase commitment to riding. We're shifting our mindset and intentionally guiding and nurturing our culture to crave agility with deeper skills and capabilities that are oriented toward customer creation. We've challenged the structure across the company, adding new talent and organizing resources to swiftly move in these new directions. ","We plan to continue new growth pursuits, including new business models, targeted acquisitions and new collaborations. Our More Roads milestones for this year include some very heavy lifting in new product delivery. We'll again raise the bar and reach impact and access when we launch our first new middleweight motorcycles, the Bronx Streetfighter, and our Pan America Adventure Touring models. We also plan to launch a new small displacement motorcycle in China and expand outside of motorcycles with the launch of Harley-Davidson e-bicycles. Our efforts are amplifying the incredible power of our brand and leveraging and expanding our expertise to deliver more for our customers. ","Our distribution -- our distribution model also includes more regional distribution centers, more access points and an even stronger global dealer network. Evidence of the transformation is also appearing in how we measure performance. Our 2020 guidance replaces heavyweight unit shipments with revenue as a primary performance measure. Revenue better reflects our comprehensive efforts to amplify our brand and foster a customer-creation culture, one that builds committed riders. ","Revenue growth, driven by an expanded product portfolio, a fresh apparel approach and a pipeline of innovative new services that inspire, develop and engage people to ride. We talked about this shift last quarter when we adjusted our long-term international growth objective from measuring percent of motorcycle volume to measuring percent of HDMC revenue. At that time, we also sharpened and intensified our U.S. growth objective for 2027, challenging ourselves to expand the total pool of U.S. riders by adding more riders and retaining more riders each year. ","During 2019, we saw progress in the right direction. We finished 2019 with 3.1 million Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S., 55,000 more total riders than in 2018. During the year, 527,000 riders joined the Harley-Davidson brand, that's almost 25,000 more than joined Harley-Davidson in 2018. The number of people who joined Harley-Davidson in 2019 demonstrates brand power and our improving capabilities. However, we know more is needed to reach our objective, which reinforces the criticality of our expanded focus and efforts to make riding matter more to more people. ","Rider migration insights we have tell us, we need to bring people in, build their confidence and capability, and keep them riding through the critical first years of their riding journey. We are testing and developing specific programs and actions right now that nurture new riders and inspire and develop all riders to continue riding with us. We know we must continue improving and growing the number of joiners and improve retention rates to end 2027 with 4 million riders in the United States. And this is the right challenge at the right time to drive continued strengthening of our customer creation capabilities as the final chapter of our decade-long transformation as a company. We set out to accomplish a lot in 2019 and we did what we said we would do - demonstrating our accelerated efforts to achieve More Roads growth and our long-term objectives. ","To sum it up, in 2019, we asserted our leadership in the electrification of motorcycles with the launch of LiveWire, our first electric motorcycle, and IRONe for kids. Our commitment to leading in the electrification of motorcycles includes broad EV portfolio development, driven by the talent and capability of our EV product development team that expanded significantly in 2019. We launched high-impact new models and delivered advanced technology to our class-leading model year 2020 motorcycles to make the ride even better. We also expanded our Thailand plant to serve the ASEAN markets, increasing customer access with more competitive retail prices. ","Our global e-commerce and digital capabilities were improved and expanded, broadening exposure and access to our products. In 2019, 75% of people who purchased Harley products on Amazon were new to Harley-Davidson. Finally, we advanced good to great dealers, making progress toward our customer experience and conversion targets. ","The dealers who participated in our U.S. dealer operations consulting engagements on average saw nearly a 6% increase in motorcycle retail sales over dealers not yet in the program. Outside the U.S., we began implementing stronger dealer initiatives in the second half of the year, which helped retail sales in developed markets improved markedly, finishing up year-over-year in the second half. We're on track with the expectations we outlined at the start of the More Roads plan, making the investments that will set us up for the growth targets we expect to achieve in 2021 and beyond. Two years in, our new products, stronger dealers broader access and amplified brand efforts are building and demonstrating key skills and capabilities. And while competition and challenges are robust, we have risen to the task along the way, competing on our merits and delivering shareholder value, while we navigate the current environment and advance our strategy. ","We're driving stability in the business, underscored by our ability to mitigate tariff impact, shift away for value-depleting sales incentives and leverage HDFS as an important strategic asset to enable business performance. Harley-Davidson is 117 years strong, but it is far from the company it was before the downturn, and it is not the same company it was even three years ago. We've transformed nearly every aspect of how we do our work. And while we have more to do in our More Roads quest to firmly establish customer creation prowess, we remain crystal clear that riding is and has always been what it's all about. We aim to make riding matter more to more people and build committed riders. ","From where we stand today, our return to growth is not off in the distance, it's right around the corner, and 2020 is our pivotal year. I'm looking ahead, and I feel good about the hard work that has laid our foundation for the year that we have ahead of us and the journey that we are on for the long term. Thank you for continuing to drive with us. And now I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results of the quarter and the full year and what we see ahead. John?","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. In the fourth quarter, we were pleased with our earnings and continue tempering in our U.S. retail sales declines. During the quarter, and throughout 2019, we made significant progress against our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan. The summary of our Q4 results is on Slide 10. ","In the fourth quarter, Motorcycle segment operating loss improved, driven by lower year-over-year SG&A and the favorable impact of our manufacturing optimization initiative, partially offset by lower shipments, higher year-over-year tariffs and unfavorable mix. Financial Services operating income was down 7%. ","Consolidated net income was up versus prior year. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.09. When excluding restructuring plan costs and the impact of recent EU and China tariffs, adjusted EPS was $0.20. We remain focused and disciplined on inventory management, aggressively managing costs, generating cash from operations and delivering strong shareholder returns over the long term. ","On Slide 11, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the fourth quarter were down 1.4% versus prior year, which represents a significant improvement in the rate of decline versus last year's fourth quarter, which was down 6.7%. In the U.S., Q4 retail sales were down 3.1% versus prior year, which represents an improvement in the rate of decline over recent quarters. Harley-Davidson's fourth quarter retail sales benefited from the year-over-year tempering of the industry's retail sales rate of decline and strong H-D market share gains. International retail sales were up 0.5% during the quarter. Emerging markets retail sales continue to increase, while developed market retail sales were down slightly. ","After a challenging second quarter, we regained momentum in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to execute our stronger dealer programs, invested in amplifying the brand through increased marketing, introduced our model year 2020 bikes and aggressively managed the supply of motorcycles into the dealer network. We expect continued headwinds in 2020 in the U.S. and developed international markets. We expect to overcome these market challenges by focusing on building committed riders and executing our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan. We believe that we have a strong plan for the future, and we are executing with great urgency. ","Now let's take a closer look at the U.S. on Slide 12. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson's retail sales were down 3.1% versus prior year behind improving retail sales performance and strong H-D market share gains. We were pleased to see the continued tempering of our retail sales rate as the fourth quarter represented the lowest rate of decline in the U.S. over the last 12 quarters. ","Q4 retail sales for the industry were down 5.6%. This rate of decline was significantly better than 2018's fourth quarter decline, but was sequentially higher than Q3 of 2019. ","On a full year basis, the rate of industry decline has improved significantly from down 8.7% in 2018 to down 4.1% in 2019. On a full year basis, Harley-Davidson's retail sales decline of 5.2% was improved over 2018's decline of 10.2%. We believe that this year-over-year improvement in the rate of decline was driven by improved industry performance, our focus on stronger dealers and increased marketing investment. ","During the quarter, Harley-Davidson's market share of new bike registrations was 50.4%, up 1.0 percentage points, despite the continued unfavorable mix shift to segments in which we do not currently compete, but will begin competing in by the end of this year as we execute our More Roads plan. In our segments, Touring and Cruiser, our Q4 market share was very strong, up 3.9 percentage points.","We tightly managed the shipments of new bikes into the dealer network in the quarter. This resulted in quarter-end U.S. retail inventory decreasing approximately 1,500 motorcycles versus prior year. We believe this market discipline is important in maintaining customer and dealer value and will, ultimately, result in stronger retail sales of new motorcycles. ","On Slide 13, fourth quarter international retail sales were up 0.5% behind growth in our emerging markets offset by slight declines in our developed markets. Retail sales in emerging markets were up 2.2% during the quarter versus prior year. The sales increases were led by growth in our ASEAN markets and in China. Strong growth in these markets was partially offset by soft sales in India. ","Retail sales in developed markets were down 0.5% during the quarter. Our developed markets experienced strength in Japan, Southern Europe and Australia, offset by softness in Canada and Northern Europe. Our full year market share in Europe was 8.9%, down 1.4 percentage points versus prior year. Our market share was adversely impacted by lapping last year's strong Softail results and by lower sales of our street motorcycles as a result of the Street recall. The detail on our More Roads plan reinforces our confidence in, and commitment to, the great potential that the international markets offer to Harley-Davidson. Our plan supports the strength of our brand, products and distribution to drive sustainable growth in international markets. ","On Slide 14, wholesale motorcycle shipments in Q4 were down 7.0% and roughly at the midpoint of our guidance. Overall family mix shifted from Touring to Cruiser motorcycles versus last year's fourth quarter. ","On Slide 15, Q4 revenue for the Motorcycles segment was down 8.5%, behind 7% decrease in motorcycle shipments. Average motorcycle revenue per bike was down $504, driven by less rich product mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by higher year-over-year pricing. ","On Slide 16, gross margin in Q4 was down as a result of lower shipments, a less rich product mix, unfavorable currency and higher manufacturing expense. Q4 product mix was unfavorable by $9.7 million, driven by a shift in family mix. ","Q4 gross margin was adversely impacted by $8.0 million of unfavorable currency, driven by a stronger U.S. dollar and lapping 2018 hedge gains. In Q4, manufacturing expense was unfavorably impacted by lower absorption on lower production and shipments, along with increased year-over-year tariffs, largely offset by savings of $15.5 million resulting from the implementation of our new manufacturing optimization initiative. ","On Slide '17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q4 improved compared to last year, driven by favorable SG&A and restructuring expenses, partially offset by lower gross margin. SG&A was significantly lower than prior year as we lap charges related to recalls, and as we continue to aggressively manage costs and investing, while investing in increased marketing and our More Roads plan. ","Restructuring charges totaled $0.7 million in the fourth quarter, favorable to prior year by $18.7 million. Profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus. It is our objective to further leverage and build our capabilities to continue to drive profit, cash flow and top quartile motor company ROIC.","Financial Services segment fourth quarter operating income, shown on Slide 18, was $58.9 million, down 7.0% compared to the prior year. Net interest income was up $4.2 million due to higher year-over-year receivables and favorable interest rate yields, partially offset by higher interest expense. ","The provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was $4.0 million, unfavorable in Q4, driven by $2.3 million of higher credit losses and increase in our credit reserves. Operating expenses were up versus prior year due, in part, to higher depreciation as a result of our investment in a new loan management system, which was implemented in January 2019. ","HDFS' operational results are on Slide 19. Q4 retail originations were down 5.9% versus prior year, driven by lower new bike sales. HDFS' market share remained very strong at 63.7%. At the end of the quarter, there was $363.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $1.77 billion of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities. ","During Q4, HDFS raised EUR 600 million in an MTN, and paid a dividend of $40 million to Harley-Davidson, Inc. ","On Slide 20, both our 30-day-plus delinquency and credit loss results were up versus prior year, despite having moved past start-up efficiencies resulting from the implementation of our new loan management system. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans receivable, loan receivables on balance sheet at year-end was 4.39% or 27 basis points higher than 2018. The annual retail credit loss rate for receivables on balance sheet was 2.0%. The 2019 full year loss rate increased 24 basis points, primarily due to the LMS impact in the first 3 quarters of 2019. Q4's loss rate was up 10 basis points, driven primarily by 2 factors: first driver relates to our strategic efforts to build riders, which included programs such as First Time Buyer and dealer paid no money down. While some of these loans may increase delinquency and credit loss metrics, they're prudently underwritten, and we expect the increased revenue from these programs to more than offset the higher expected risk. ","The second driver of Q4's increased loss rate is softer motorcycle prices at auction. The remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 21. Our year-end cash and marketable securities balance was $833.9 million. Full year operating cash flow of $868.3 million was down versus last year, driven by higher working capital and lower net income. Regarding liquidity, the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. We believe the charts on Slide 22 demonstrates that over time, we are a leader in ROIC at the motor company and return on equity at HDFS, and we are a clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders. 1 of the 5 objectives guiding our business strategy and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by motor company ROIC in the top quartile of the S&P 500, and by best-in-class returns on equity at HDFS. ","Slide 23 illustrates our recent history of returning cash to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we paid a dividend of $0.375 per share and repurchased 87.7 million -- I'm sorry, $78.7 million of our stock. Driving superior value for our stakeholders is a top priority. We have a robust and disciplined process for our investment decisions. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and share repurchases. ","Slide 24 is the summary of our multiyear manufacturing optimization. Full year results came in favorable to our expectations, with total realized savings of $32.2 million and an incurred cost of $43.0 million in 2019. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our investment in manufacturing optimization is largely compete -- complete. We continue to expect annual ongoing savings of $65 million to $75 million after 2020. ","Moving on to our 2020 full year guidance on Slide 25. In 2020, we expect Motorcycle segment revenue to be approximately $4.53 billion to $4.66 billion, or down 1% to up 2% versus 2019. As Matt mentioned, in 2020, we are now providing revenue guidance instead of our shipment guidance. We are making this change because revenue is a much more comprehensive view of our business given the breadth of revenue growth drivers included in our More Roads plan that are not captured by motorcycle shipments. ","These revenue drivers include such things as small displacement motorcycles, electric bicycles, electric 2-wheelers for kids and expanded focus on broadening access to our general merchandise offerings. To help bridge the changeover to revenue guidance, we expect 601+cc and LiveWire worldwide motorcycle shipments to be down modestly to up slightly in 2020. We expect H-D's U.S. retail sales to be lower year-over-year behind lower U.S. industry retail sales, but to continue to temper during the year. During 2020, we expect worldwide retail sales to be positively impacted by sharpened focus on increasing committed riders and our investment in stronger dealers; model year '20 and model year '21 motorcycles, including our entry into the dual and sports segments with Pan America and Bronx models in late 2020; and expansion of the international dealer network. However, we expect these positive sales impacts to continue to be met by strong headwinds, including a declining U.S. new bike industry, a relative shift in rider preference towards segments in which we do not currently compete, but we'll enter by the end of this year and a marketplace crowded with highly competitive promotions, incentives and discounts. ","We expect to continue to aggressively manage the supply of retail inventory. However, we do expect year-end worldwide retail inventory to increase moderately behind dealer fill of our new middleweight motorcycles and with the replenishment of our European dealer inventory, which was reduced at the end of 2019 in anticipation of low tariff motorcycles shipping from Thailand. ","In 2020, motorcycle segment operating margin as a percent of revenue is expected to be between 7% and 8%, up from 2019 operating margin of 6.3%. We expect gross margin to increase in 2020 behind lower year-over-year EU and China tariffs and strong operational productivity, including approximately $23 million in incremental manufacturing optimization savings. However, we expect these gains in gross margin to be partially offset by unfavorable motorcycle mix. ","During 2020, we expect the impact of recent EU and China tariffs to be approximately $30 million, which is down significantly from 2019's tariff impacts of $97.9 million. This includes EU tariffs of approximately $20 million due to the sell-through of high-tariff inventory and tariffs on our Trikes and CVO models, which we will continue to produce in the United States. In addition, we expect to incur approximately $15 million in Section 301 Tariffs. ","While we continue to drive costs out of our SG&A spend, we do expect it to be higher in 2020 behind increased investment in our More Roads plan as we lapped $34 million of 2019 recall benefits, primarily driven by supplier recall cost recoveries that we do not expect to repeat. In 2020, our investment in our More Roads plan peaks as we finalize product development and plan to launch our new middleweight motorcycles, electric bicycles and a small displacement motorcycle in China. ","Finally, we do not expect any restructuring costs in 2020, which will compare favorably to the $32.4 million of charges incurred in 2019. ","At HDFS, we expect modestly higher revenue in 2020 to be largely offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher interest costs as we roll over low interest rate MTNs. Credit loss are expected to be slightly higher despite lapping last year's higher losses driven by the implementation of the LMS system. We expect 2020 credit losses to be affected, in part, by higher loss experience on certain financing programs. In 2020, we will adopt CECL, the new accounting pronouncement for credit losses. As a result, we expect a onetime increase in the allowance for credit losses in the range of $70 million to $110 million, with the offset being a reduction to retained earnings net of taxes. This new accounting standard will not have an impact on the economics or cash flows of the HDFS business. However, we do expect increased earnings volatility as a result of CECL.","To help our investors better understand HDFS' changes in provision expense, we will begin providing actual year-over-year credit losses in addition to changes in reserves. Capital expenditures in 2020 are expected to be between $215 million and $235 million. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be 24% to 25%. ","As we look forward to the first quarter of 2020, we expect Motorcycle segment revenue to be between $1.09 billion and $1.17 billion down 2% to down 9% versus prior year. Motorcycle segment operating margin as a percent of revenue is also expected to be down approximately 2.5 percentage points. First quarter gross margin is expected to be flat, driven by favorable tariff impacts and increased productivity, while we expect to be -- which we expect to be offset by unfavorable mix. SG&A is expected to be higher as we lap approximately $28 million of 2019 favorability related to recall recoveries. ","To wrap up, we faced and overcame a number of challenges in 2019. Most notably, we have a plan to mitigate the majority of our recent EU and China tariff impacts and made significant progress on our More Roads plan. As we look to 2020, we are very encouraged by the momentum that we have gained over the last year on retail sales trends, but also recognize the substantial headwinds that we continue to face. Looking longer term, we are incredibly excited about our 2020 More Roads milestones, which will strengthen our existing business and unlock sustainable growth that will propel us in a new direction and deliver significant value through 2022. We are committed to driving long-term growth for the company and strong returns for our shareholders. Thank you. And now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.","Craig Kennison","Matt, I think you reported that there was 527,000 riders that joined the brand and a net gain of 55,000. So you, I think, lost 472,000. The question is, what is behind the decision by those people to leave? And then on a related note, if you're growing the total number of riders, should we ultimately see growth in P&A? Is there a strong correlation there?","Matthew Levatich","Yes, Craig, thanks. It's the right question. It's a good question. And what we had year-over-year is a very similar retention rate. So as the new riders joined, the people that left also increased, as you pointed out, for a net increase of 55,000. So what we know from the rider migration database, we have a ton of insights about the profile of the exiters and the reasons why they're leaving and the single biggest driver and where we're focusing our efforts is on that early-stage rider. Those people that have raised their hand, took the time, invested the money, learned how to ride, purchased a motorcycle, intend to exit the sport within the first 3 years because they haven't yet built the confidence necessary to become what we're calling a committed rider. That is the single largest driver of that exit number, and it is, therefore, the singular focus of our efforts around building rider commitment is how do we really nurture those early-stage riders. And those programs that I referenced that are underway right now are very specific programmatic things that we're doing to address that single biggest driver of those early-stage exiters. And yes, as we see the total participation in the motorcycle increase that we're driving, we should expect to see a return to growth in P&A and apparel sales as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","So I guess, from the outside, it's really hard to gauge the transformation you're going through from the numbers we're seeing? And I know you highlighted some things in your prepared commentary. I guess, if you go back to, I want to say, it was a few years ago where you unveiled the transformation strategy, can you help us gauge like where you might be ahead of where you had thought you would be at this point where you might be lagging a little bit just so we could kind of level set ahead of what looks like is an expected bigger ramp in 2021?","Matthew Levatich","Yes, Sharon, thanks. This is Matt. I appreciate the question. I would say when you look at the net increase of riders in 2018 was to 26,000, I believe. And last year, 2019, was 55,000. So we are improving, but -- and I mentioned this in my remarks, we need to accelerate our efforts. And that's what's behind this targeted effort that I mentioned in answering Craig's question. So we set out 10-year objectives and that objective specifically is to increase the number of riders in the U.S. to 4 million. It's at 3.1 million now, so clearly, we have to pick up the pace to close that gap. And we have very specific programs in place that we're piloting right now to do that. And we feel good about it. And part of what's challenging about this transformation is it's really challenging the culture of the company, including even in the dealer network. ","When for 100 plus years, we've woken up every morning and told ourselves, our job is to make great motorcycles, and we did a great job at that. It is quite a different challenge to wake up in the morning and say we now need to build riders. That requires different skills, different capabilities and different mindsets and a different cultural attitude and culture, our culture is very powerful, it's important, and to shift that culture, we're very -- taking very deliberate steps with talent, with organizational structures and conscious efforts to just reinforce to everybody associated with the brand that our job is beyond just building great bikes, it's really becoming very skilled at building riders and customer creation, as I had mentioned. And it's simply to say that of all the transformations that we've done, and they've been very significant and very difficult, whether we're talking manufacturing or product development, this one is the most significant because we're thinking differently about what we're here to do and that requires all of us to show up differently in the company and even including in the dealer network. So we're into it and we have a lot more work to go, you can see that in the numbers, we need to accelerate our pace and we're adding things to the mix to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy Conder","Matt, if I would, just maybe do -- can you delve into a little bit of the specific programs maybe that you started in 2019 and then maybe some new ones that you may be doing in 2020 here to help further reduce that churn rate, which again, you're making the net progress, which is good. But again, as you said, that's the key focus within the first 3 years of ridership. ","And then just a follow-up for John, on HDFS. Just, John, would you anticipate now given that we're past the anniversary of the system changeover, those delinquencies to kind of level off here, even though you said that your maybe that's popped up a little in Q4 due to some of the new programs.","Matthew Levatich","Okay. I'll start. Just I would say broadly, there's 4 target areas that we have based on the rider retention and ridership insights. So -- and we have pilots of various types in place in Q1. Last year, we did some sort of intermediate steps short of riding academy to give people the opportunity to just have a simple sort of 2 hour overview so that they could get in first gear, get their foot up on the pegs and right across the parking lot and just begin to feel beyond the jump-start that we've been doing, what it's actually like to ride to just nurture them into the whole process of deeper learning. ","So that is ongoing, and we've added to the mix notionally or conceptually anyway, specific programs around riders, recruiting riders, so leveraging the passion of existing riders to help build the next-generation of riders. Rider recruiting riders, riders coaching riders, which is to help those people in those early stage gain the confidence and the skills and capabilities that they need to fully enjoy riding. And in addition to offer riders of various experience levels, opportunity to increase their experience on their turf and on their terms, not, if you will, locked into specific programs. The third is riding anywhere anytime. And this is addressing some of the barriers that people have that are practical around \"I don't have a bike\" or \"I don't have the gear,\" or \"I don't have someone to ride with,\" I don't know -- \"I can't find the time to do it.\" ","So we're piloting different things to see if we can unlock some of those barriers. And the fourth one is really into solidifying rider commitment, and we know from our research that riding epic journeys as simple as your first overnight ride tends to really solidify the power of riding as sort of a transformational personal experience. And so that riding epic journeys idea is about how do we help people, again, get deeper into the passion that we all have for riding. So that's the programmatic themes or concepts, if you will, that we have specific in market tests that were underway right now that we'll begin reporting on as we go through the year.","John Olin","And Tim, your second question, this is John. Your second question was, do we expect credit losses to level off in 2020? And the answer is broadly yes. In our prepared remarks, we do expect a slight increase in credit losses, but nothing what we saw this year, but a slight increase, and that will be offset by increased revenue at HDFS.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","First want to say I really appreciate and respect how you articulate the challenges. It really is kind of daunting, things like e-bikes and building riders, the cultural change for the 117-year-old company, it's really profound. You clearly demonstrate a very high awareness and they're trying a bunch of really valiant efforts here. I guess [indiscernible] we're having this conversation, though, at a time of arguably the greatest U.S. economic expansion, one of the greatest economic expansions and greatest equity bull markets in history. So it'll be one thing if we were having these problems like in a downturn, but it's just the economy is really humming along, right? So I guess, if in the event, over the next year, which you described it as a pivot year, I think, people on this call agree. If these efforts don't really show the fruit that you're hoping here, and then there's no guarantee of success, would your management team and your Board of Directors consider strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company to help preserve this incredible franchise and brand and to maximize shareholder value?","Matthew Levatich","Thanks, Adam. I would say that the board is always mindful of maximizing shareholder value and assessing all the decision and obviously, the strategy of the company. So we're obviously very -- as a board, very tied into the operations performance and strategy of the company, and we'll continue to evaluate it. We have a lot of growth platforms beyond just increasing ridership in the United States. And so you'd need to look no further than the investment in the middleweight platform and the potential that, that has, as we gain access to the significant majority of the heavyweight marketplace outside the United States. So we've been laying the groundwork with dealer distribution points, stronger dealer initiatives, the plant in Thailand, laying the groundwork for a very strong and potent impact of that middleweight platform investment. And so independent of those U.S. ridership investments, we have growth trajectories that are part of our strategy. ","EV is another one. Not just to the ease of ridership on an EV product is remarkable, but also investing in making sure that we are positioned as the leader of the electrification of 2 wheels because that is clearly the direction that automotive products are going over time, and they make for phenomenal products. So all these things are part of the strategy. I would say that it is important for this organization to challenge ourselves in the way that we are to become a customer-creation company here in the United States. Anything short of that, and it may have proved that, that is a very difficult, durable problem to solve, but we are all about it because it's important that we be about it, that we change the way we show up as a company and get skilled in the ways needed to do that. The challenge today is significant, not just people are joining the sport of motorcycling. And people are leaving for different reasons, as I alluded to earlier. But we -- it's not -- we're not talking about competition in the way we used to talk about competition. ","Competition is about competition for people's scarce time, people's scarce funding and commitment. We use that word a lot, commitment is becoming scarcer in the decisions people make as far as investing their time. And you can see that in all kinds of other industries that require a lot of time to become really embedded in doing something, and that's what our efforts are about. We think those efforts are very important skill and capability building for the company anyway, even if this challenge proves more durable than we are setting out to achieve. And in the meantime, we have lots of other growth platforms that we're investing in as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","I hope you can offer some clarification on the late 2020 launch of some of these other displacement bikes. I'm curious if that will be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, the year could look very different depending on when you guys are anticipating launching them. And then also, if you could clarify what you might have as adjusted operating margins -- motorcycle operating margins for your outlook? I know you've said 7% to 8%. But I think, maybe excluding those tariffs, again, that will be closer to 9%.","John Olin","Thanks, Jamie. This is John. With regards to the launch, we -- I think you're referring two of the middleweight motorcycle that will bring us into the segments that we don't currently compete in, in particular, the dual segment with Pan America and the sports segment with our Bronx motorcycle. So that will be coming out towards the end of the year, and we would expect some shipments, largely in the United States for that and some retail sales in the U.S. and not so much on the retail side of our European markets at that point, given the time for shipment.","The second question is on operating margin. Our guidance is for 7% to 8%. And I believe you had mentioned 9%., given the fact that we have tariffs. So when we look at the overall guidance of 8 to -- 7% to 8%, that includes tariff and manufacturing optimization favorability and -- but there's a couple of offsets to that. And I think that's why you may be at a little bit higher number. So let's talk through that for a second. ","On tariffs, again, to be very clear, we had $98 million embedded in our 2019 actuals. And we expect, going forward, that to be $35 million. I believe, on the prepared remarks, I said $30 million on the piece of paper, it said $35 million, and it $35 million. So Jamie, that is $63 million of year-over-year favorability as we start to come off the tariffs because of the actions that we've taken. The second piece is the productivity side of it, which includes our manufacturing optimization. If we kind of dissect that, there's 3 components of that. There's a restructuring component that won't repeat next year, that's $33 million of favorability. There's a temporary inefficiency piece that's embedded in our 2019 performance, that's $10 million, that will be favorable next year because we won't have those inefficiencies as we move forward. ","And then finally, the reason that we did it is to gain savings moving forward. We had $32 million of savings in 2019, and we expect an additional $23 million. So those 3 components, Jamie, add up to $66 million. So you add those 2 together, we do have tailwinds of about $129 million as we move into 2020, which is clearly over -- that represents a little over 2.5 percentage points, and that's over where our guidance is. So I think your question is, why is it 7% to 8%., and there are 2 things that are going to pull us down from the 9% that you had mentioned. One is this unfavorable mix. We saw unfavorable mix in 2019 and largely driven by touring becoming a smaller part of our overall mix. And this is something that we've been talking about for a couple of years now, and this is the shift of consumer preference to motorcycles outside of the ones that we make and, clearly, the driving force behind our investment in More Roads. We expect that trend to continue into 2020, and so there'll be a headwind on mix that may not be in your models. ","The other piece of it is on SG&A. So there's 2 component pieces of SG&A that are going to be higher. One is, again, lapping, call it, a onetime or a non-repeating item with regards to the supplier recoveries and recalls. That's $34 million headwind as we move into 2020. And then the second piece is, is that the spending on our More Roads and product development, in the 5-year period that we call our More Roads plan, the peak investment period is 2020. And the reason for that is very straightforward as we're coming out with a lot of new and different products, which requires a lot of engineering investment and product development spending is typically the highest before a product is launched. And then the second piece is our More Roads investment to launch those products and the go-to-market spending to make sure everyone understands those products and the consumer benefits. So we will hit a peak on that spending and SG&A will be up a little bit more than what we're seeing in the investment analysts models. So with those 2, we do expect operating margin to be between 7% and 8%, all-inclusive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Altobello","John, I want to go back to a comment you made earlier about softer use motorcycle prices at auction in the quarter. And maybe give us a sense for where that's been trending of late? It sounds like the gap between new and used pricing has widened a bit, and how you're thinking about that heading into 2020?","John Olin","So when we look at overall pricing, we've typically talked in 3 levels; what's happening at auction; what's happening with pricing services that provide data to consumers and dealers; and then finally, what's happening in our dealer network. So Joe, you asked about the first one, which is at auction. We've now seen, after 9 quarters of improvement, we had a flat quarter in Q2, and 2 quarters that we've been down slightly in terms of auction prices in Q3 and Q4. ","As we tag on to that, the pricing services had about 8 quarters of increased pricing direction. But in the last quarter, we had them split. We had one service that was projecting higher prices and then the other lower. And then the third level of how we look at used bike prices is what's actually transacting in our dealer network. And with that, we've had 10 consecutive quarters of used bike prices rising, which is very good news. And again, this quarter -- in the fourth quarter, they rose. So we've got a little bit of mix here. We have got a close eye on what's happening at auction because that typically ripples through to the dealer network. But at this point, we are seeing improving used bike prices in our dealer network.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","I want to talk about the departure of Neil Grimmer. He was a highlight at the Analyst Day. I thought he had a great presentation. Wondering who's replacing him? And are there changes to the brand development strategy?","Matthew Levatich","Gerrick, I'll take that. Yes. I -- the same reasons for bringing Neil in exists today, and I'm actively recruiting for a new brand President and the work that was done while he was here and since is inherent in the strategy that we have for building committed riders. So we are hard at work on that direction, and we've got a great team that is in place doing that work, and in the meantime, I'm leading that team and making sure that their work is fully integrated as we go to market here in the United States and around the world. So steady as she goes. We need leadership of that nature for the work that we need to do to become really skilled at customer creation. And as soon as we get that talent, we'll be delighted to get them in front of our investors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Just a question on the international business, and you'd indicated that the sales -- retail sales in the developed markets were down slightly. I guess the question is, are you seeing something change in terms of credit availability from the legacy lenders in those markets that would have contributed to a growth headwind there?","John Olin","Thanks, David. This is John. We are not seeing any change in credit availability in our developed markets or international markets. Remember, HDFS plays a very critical role in our access to credit in those markets, and they're certainly well schooled in working with third-party providers. As you know, we only had landed underwrite in Canada and the United States. But they are working with us side by side, and we're not seeing any change in credit availability of those developed markets. And again, with that, we're very pleased with what we've seen in the back half of this year on our sales in international markets. After our first half of being down about 6.6% we've seen growth in the back half so thanks, David.","David MacGregor","And just as a follow-up question, John. I guess, you ran a number of promotions in the quarter, the extended warranty promotion, a few other things. How do you feel riders responded to those promotions? And what does that tell you about how you guide your promotional activity going forward?","John Olin","Thanks, David. Actually, we had very little promotions in the fourth quarter this year. We didn't have a whole lot last year either. The extended warranty program is one of those, but that's been more of a perennial program. We've offered that for several years. And that just is an opportunity for somebody that comes in and the dead of winter, to give them a couple more months of warranty so that they don't use that up when I'm sitting in their garage or in storage. So that has not been a core driver of promotional activity, but again, consistent over the last several years. Overall, as you know, from the first quarter of this year, we've been tempering our promotional activity and incentives. We did do a finance offer in the third quarter, much smaller than the one that we had in the third quarter of 2018. But in the fourth quarter of this year, we didn't have any notable promotions or dollars off promotions. We had some in 2018 fourth quarter. We had a private offer out there, no real financing offers in the fourth quarter and this is the way we're moving forward. We've redirected those funds to building and amplifying the brand and have been very pleased with the results that we've seen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush.","James Hardiman","A lot of my questions were answered, but I wanted to circle back, John, to your -- I think it was Jamie's question on margin. And I think a lot of the detail you gave was really helpful with the bridge. But 2 questions on that front. I guess, first, $34 million in, I guess, you call them warranty recovery benefits. I don't remember those being talked about in the past, but maybe give us -- or help us understand the timing of those in 2019? Presumably, we would want to then pull those benefits out of our numbers as we roll forward into 2020. It sounds like some of that even happened in the first quarter. So help us with the timing there? Number one. And then the EU waiver, obviously, the timing there was a big negative in 2019, and I seem to recall it was going to be a nice positive here in 2020. When does that hit? And how much does that benefit shipments and margins?","Matthew Levatich","Okay. First question is with regards to the timing of supplier -- largely supplier recoveries. If you remember back in Q4 of 2018, we had 2 recalls, a total of $55 million. In the first quarter of 2019, we received a supplier recovery of $28 million. And that would have been listed in K and was mentioned in the call at that time. Over the year, largely in the second quarter, James, we also had a release of other recall reserves of about $6 million. So those 2, we do not expect to repeat in 2020, but will be a headwind, and again, they total $34 million. And yes, 24 -- $28 million of it, and we talked about the first quarter, is going to hit and be a headwind in the first quarter of 2020.","The second piece is, with regards to the EU. So we were looking for a decision from the EU that came later than we had anticipated. And with that, in the second quarter, we called down some of our shipment volumes because we were going to take inventories down in -- at the end of the year in anticipation of lower tariff inventory coming in from the plant in Thailand. That's not the only reason we took it down, there's some softness in international markets as well. So that has come. And the company did a fantastic job, and our team in Europe did a fantastic job of working down inventories. Overall, international inventory was down 3,000 units. We expect that about 2,000 out of Europe, and we got a little bit more than that. And so we will look to replenish inventories in 2020, and that's part of the revenue drivers that we have of being down 1% to up 2% as we will replenish that inventory with lower tariff bikes coming from Thailand. And so that is a shift of revenue, not necessarily a margin. ","Also, we did have increased cost from that delayed decision and that cost will be lapped. I think that was in the $5 million range, and so there'll be a benefit in 2020, which is incorporated in our operating margin guidance of 7% to 8%.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","So LiveWire deliveries were slower than expected, just given some of the manufacturing issues from a while ago. Can you talk about the -- maybe the sales momentum of that line? And continued enthusiasm and the level of enthusiasm by consumers as well as dealers?","Matthew Levatich","This is Matt. I -- we're a couple of things. So we are back at the planned rate, and it took us time to get to that rate as we worked these early supply chains, and we're extremely diligent and cautious about making sure that every motorcycle that gets out in the market is perfect in the eyes of the customer. The early feedback has been fantastic. I would say, from an underlying demand perspective, it's hard to tell for 2 reasons; one, we're filling preorders still; and two, it's the winter. So we'll really know a lot more about the underlying demand for LiveWire when there's [indiscernible] in our LiveWire launch as we established a one-to-one white glove process where various folks within the company, within engineering, customer service are very knowledgeable about the product, had one-to-one relationships with early buyers. And answering their questions, gauging their enthusiasm and interest, and that's part of the feedback that we're getting from early owners and the feedback is just phenomenal. So we're extremely pleased with the reaction from the press and the reaction from the early owners. We're working through the pre orders for a planned rate. We're building out inventory in the dealer channel. We're building out availability outside the United States as well. We've got phase 2 dealers coming on in the U.S. this year. So there's a lot to look forward to with LiveWire. And we'll know a lot more when spring season hits and there's availability to fulfill sort of instantaneous demand.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO, John Olin. Matt, let's get started.","Matt Levatich","Thank you, Shannon. And good morning, everyone. In July, we announced the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan, the acceleration of our strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, grow motorcycling and return our business to growth through 2022.","During 2018, we met or exceeded all stated planned milestones [here] [ph]. Our execution is on track and we are energized that we are getting new and different people, riders and non-riders, stand up, take notice of Harley-Davidson.","We're equally energized by our current riders who are deeply engaged in the brand and tell us they too are excited at the direction we are headed. It's clear that for riders today and Harley-Davidson riders of tomorrow groundwork for an exciting future is being built real time [Technical Difficulty].","Our plan to step up our strategic efforts reinforced throughout 2018 as the industry in the U.S. and certain developed international markets continued to be challenging. While most of 2018 played out largely as we expected, the declining industry performance in the fourth quarter prompted key business decision, including pulling back on shipment to drive even lower than planned [brand] [ph] inventory.","We also took further belt-tightening restructuring actions in addition to our planned cost savings related to optimizing our U.S. manufacturing footprint. Our efforts to transition U.S. production to our expanded operations in York remain on track and our 2018 program costs were lower than originally planned.","Through our actions and keen focus on working capital, we delivered improved year-over-year earnings and cash from operations and importantly we maintained our ability to invest in the future. We dug deeper and found ways to go faster, while continuing to deliver strong cash for our shareholders. [Technical Difficulty].","Each of the three growth catalysts, new products, broader access and stronger dealers. When it comes to new products, our 2019 motorcycles are hands down our best product offering ever, demonstrating clear commitment to the passion, preferences of our current riders.","During 2018, we launched new models and debuted new rider confidence, safety performance and infotainment. Our commitment to lead in the electrification in motorcycling is also clear. In November, our first electric Harley-Davidson stole the show when it made its European debut at the Milan Motorcycle Show.","Already this year, we provided a first glimpse of our broader electric portfolio at CES, which drove 2.6 million video views across social channels with the largest audience being 25 to 34 year olds.","Our statement at CES garnered over 4500 media mentions on Harley's innovation, technological advancement and bold leadership stance. Even before the first LiveWire is delivered, we are reaping a strategic value of this extraordinary motorcycle. The buzz is helping build interest and relevance in Harley-Davidson amongst a new audience and redefining the global perception of our brand.","As the halo product in our future portfolio of electric products, LiveWire is already doing what it is intended to do. It's value to our brand is captivating and inspiring new people about what's possible with Harley-Davidson and why riding [Technical Difficulty] a look.","The positioning and pricing reflects the quality, capability and value of this incredible motorcycle. It's a serious high performance and highly innovative motorcycle. A Thoroughbred, the most thrilling motorcycle I've ever ridden.","LiveWire is not only igniting passion at the highest echelon of motorcyclists, it's captivating a vast audience, who will be inspired to imagine and discover what is possible - Harley-Davidson, and that is invaluable. That\u2019s what a Halo is all about.","When it comes to broader access, we're accelerating our progress to grow reach and relevance. This growth catalyst is all about helping us cast a much wider net than we do today by aligning our efforts in integrated ways, we can attract new and different consumers, increase the value for these consumers and meet people where they are and how they want to engage.","By example in line with our plans to reach more urban dwellers, especially in Asia, 23 branded Harley-Davidson apparel stores were opened in 2018. These stores in heavy-food traffic areas, offer a unique line of branded apparel which we know is one of the first easiest ways to [try] [ph] us on and begin their journey with us. In fact, our sample survey tells us over 75% of shoppers today it's their first visit to any Harley-Davidson store and over 60% are under 34 years old.","In 2018, we also launched e-commerce in China via Tmall one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. We see tremendous long-term opportunity in China and will continue to invest in proven activities to drive awareness, interest in sales.","In the U.S., we expanded our reach in a big way with the launch of Harley-Davidson- branded storefront on Amazon.com. Sales were strong and the initial data indicates that the majority of people purchasing our products on Amazon are new to the brand. We also enhanced our e-commerce store on H-D.com and exceeded our milestone for the year with 6% of general merchandise sales for H-D.com in 2018.","Full year total e-commerce sales were up 32%. With these efforts we\u2019re building an integrated multi-channel retail experience that today's consumers expect and providing new consumers an inspiring and convenient way to connect with and shop for Harley-Davidson products.","In an environment of rapidly increasing customer expectation, which we're meeting with an expanded portfolio of products and services, the Motor Company and our dealers must be prepared. Dealers are a critical component of our success as they bring the spirit of Harley-Davidson motorcycling to life each and every day. That's why stronger dealers is one of our growth catalysts. It emphasizes dealer capability and puts in place increased support and incentives under a performance framework, part of this work includes creating conditions for growth, consolidation, scale and investment for every willing [Technical Difficulty].","Strong dealer\u2019s means optimizing our network composition, providing more meaningful support, tailored individual dealer\u2019s needs and expanding our international footprint. In 2018, 56 international dealerships were opened.","Underpinning all our efforts globally is a topline strategy over the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders through 2027. We set 10 year objectives knowing this would be a long march, to change the way people think about motorcycles. It requires our very best efforts, significant change and it requires time. More Roads is our plan to accelerate our progress and it includes clear deliverables 2022.","Our capabilities in building and retaining new riders are improving. We continued the momentum we started in 2017 and ended 2018 with over 52,000 more Harley-Davidson riders in the United States. All positive signs, but more is needed.","Our marketing investments engage new and existing riders in 2018. Riding Academy sales conversion was up 2.2 percentage points over last year. We drove relevance and interest through our activations with celebrities and social media influencer whose content and activity generated equivalent traditional media value that was up 80%.","Thousands of Sportster and Street purchasers were offered the Freedom Promise, an incentive to create [indiscernible] motorcycle and existing riders demonstrated their increased engagement by logging 45 million mile to our Ride 365 app, a 137% increase over last year. Nothing sells riding like riding and keeping existing riders engaged is a key to growing our business.","Looking forward our efforts will intensify. We're on track with our new middleweight motorcycles plan to launch 2020. The Pan-America Adventure Touring and Streetfighter Motorcycle are being put through the paces on all kinds of terrain and are demonstrating power, strength and competitiveness.","The immense talent and capabilities of our design and engineering team continue to boldly expand how the look, sound and feel of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle drive appeal with new types of people.","Focusing now on 2019, we know market challenges will persist and we're meeting them head-on with drive, clarity of purpose and a solid plan. Our More Roads plan leverages our many strengths and it is our call to action as industry leader.","In the U.S., it commands us to increase relevant [indiscernible] motorcycling. Our plan recognizes and addresses - changing global - consumer preferences towards more - accessible motorcycle and a growing interest in demand for ease, power and thrill of electric. And More Roads recognized the tremendous international opportunities that we believe will drive international sales to become at least 50% of our annual sales volume in the not so distant future.","We will continue to lead with passion and focus to disrupt the status quo and ignite ultra movement for motorcycles inspiring new people and our current riders to join us all along the way. Thank you for continuing to ride with us well.","And now I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results of the quarter and the full year. John?","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. Our fourth quarter financial results were impacted by first our decision to reduce shipments in an effort to lower worldwide retail inventories, as well as a result of slightly lower than expected retail sales in our international markets.","Next we booked two voluntary recalls during the quarter. And finally, we recorded an additional restructuring charge in our efforts to aggressively manage the company cost.","In the face of ongoing retail sales headwinds in the U.S., we remain focused and disciplined on tightening U.S. retail inventory, aggressively managing cost and driving improved cash from operations. In fact, in 2018, we increased operating cash by over $200 million, a 20% increase over prior year.","Summary of our Q4 results is on slide 10. In the fourth quarter, revenue was down behind lower shipments. Motorcycle operating income was impacted by lower shipments, $19.4 million of restructuring charges, higher year-over-year SG&A, driven by two recalls, and the impact of incremental tariffs.","Financial Services operating income was down slightly. Consolidated net income was largely flat to prior year due to lower operating income, offset by the benefit of a considerably lower tax.","EPS for the quarter was $0.00 per share. When excluding restructuring plan cost and the impact of incremental tariffs, EPS was $0.17 per share. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and returns over the long-term.","On slide 11, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q4 were down 6.7% versus prior year. In the U.S., Q4 retail sales were down versus prior year, driven by significant declines in the U. S. industry and slight market share declines.","International retail sales were down modestly in Q4, driven by year-over-year declines in certain developed markets, partially offset by continued growth in emerging markets.","While we expect our business to remain under pressure in 2019 driven by continuing challenges in the U.S. motorcycle industry, we intend to introduce exciting new products and add innovation that customers value in our new motorcycles. We also expect to aggressively manage supply and execute marketing efforts to encourage trial and increased conversion to sale.","Through 2022, our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan is designed to build the proper foundation, drive the right fundamentals to help steer the U.S. industry back to health, and to drive significant growth across our international markets.","Let's take a closer look at the U.S. on slide 12. Retail sales were down 10.1% versus prior year quarter. While the U. S. retail sales decline is very disappointing, the decline was in line with our expectations.","The U.S. industry was down 8.4% in the quarter. We believe the industry was down largely because of soft used bike prices and a relative shift and rider preferences towards smaller motorcycles.","Looking at used bikes, prices remain at historically low levels compared to new. However, we are encouraged as we continue to see positive momentum in used bike pricing.","During Q4, pricing services such as NADA and Black Book published higher values for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, while prices were slightly lower at auction. Additionally, the sixth consecutive quarter saw a rising prices of used Harley-Davidson bikes in our dealer network.","Used Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales were up through November. Our share of the combined new and used motorcycle registrations was up through November and has been for the last nine consecutive years. We believe used sales are also an indicator of our brand health and provide prospects for future new bike sales.","2018 full year market share of new bike registrations was 49.7%, down 1.0 percentage points. Our U.S. market share reflects the adverse impact of a highly competitive marketplace and relatively strong growth in segments which we do not currently compete.","In the segments where we do not compete, the Touring and the segments where we do compete, Touring and Cruisers segments, which represent approximately 70% of the 601+cc market, our market share was up 0.8 percentage points on a full year basis.","During the quarter, we pulled back on shipments of new bikes in the channel. This resulted in yearend U.S. retail inventory decreasing approximately 350 motorcycles over the prior year. We believe this market discipline is important in maintaining customer and dealer value and will ultimately result in strong retail sales of new motorcycles.","On slide 13, international retail sales were down 2.6% in the fourth quarter, slightly below our expectations. On a full year basis, international sales were up slightly. During Q4, emerging market retail sales were up 18.7% driven by double-digit growth in several markets including China, Brazil and India.","Retail sales in developed international markets were down in the fourth quarter resulting primarily from ongoing weakness in Japan and Australia. During 2018, these two markets experienced cracking industry sales and competitive new product introductions of segments outside of are Touring and Cruising.","Retail sales were also down modestly in Western Europe driven by weak consumer confidence in France and the U.K. On a full-year market - our full year market share in Europe 10.3%, up 0.5 percentage points versus prior year.","As a detail on our More Roads plan reinforces, we remain confident in, committed to great potential that international markets offer to Harley-Davidson. We believe our brand, products and distribution will drive sustainable growth in international markets.","On slide 14, wholesale motorcycle shipments were down in the quarter on a full year basis. We came in under our full year shipment guidance as a result of our decision to reduce retail inventory from plan levels in both the U.S. and international market on a lower-than-expected international retail sales.","Compared to last year's fourth quarter Street and Sportster shipments as a percent of the total were up behind improved sales rates, offset by lower cruiser mix as we lap last year's initial selling of our new Softail motorcycles.","On slide 15, revenue for the motorcycle segment was down 8.7% in the fourth quarter and a 7.9% decrease in year-over-year motorcycle shipments. Revenue during the quarter benefited from $230 increase in the average motorcycle revenue per bike, this increase was driven by higher year-over-year pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.","Both P&A and general merchandise sales lagged, retail motorcycle sales growth in the fourth quarter due in large part the timing of our fiscal calendar that had one less week versus last year\u2019s calendar.","In addition, general merchandise was down as it lapped strong sell-in of our 115th anniversary products. Full year revenue was [up 1.1%, bike] shipments being down 5.3%. We believe this demonstrates a resilience of our company and brand in the face [Technical Difficulty].","On slide 16, gross margin in Q4 was down as a result of lower shipments, unfavorable manufacturing expense and higher raw material cost partially offset by higher pricing and favorable currency.","Financial impact of currency was favorable by $4.0 million during the fourth quarter. Q4 foreign currency exchange gains were partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which adversely impacted revenue by 1.5%. Raw material costs were higher during the quarter behind increased steel and aluminum pricing.","Finally, manufacturing was unfavorable versus prior year driven by the impact of incremental tariffs, lower absorption on reduced production and shipments and temporary inefficiencies related to our manufacturing optimization. Q4 tariff costs increased by $13.4 million driven by higher EU and China tariffs, the full year impact of incremental tariffs $23.7 million.","On slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q4 was lower compared to last year, driven by lower gross margin, higher SG&A and restructuring expense. SG&A was adversely impacted by two voluntary recalls booked in the fourth quarter. The first was a $35 million clutch recall on certain Touring and Softail bikes which we discussed last quarter.","The second was a brake recall on our street motorcycles for which we recorded a $20 million charge. We believe that limited parts availability for referring our street motorcycles will adversely impacted for Q1 2019 retail sales by approximately 2500 motorcycles, primarily in our international market. We do not believe that these recalls will have a meaningful impact on our full year retail sales.","Restructuring charges totaled $19.4 million in the fourth quarter including ongoing manufacturing optimization of $15.5 million and an additional $3.9 million restructuring charge related to cost-reduction efforts.","Profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus. It is our objective to further leverage our established capabilities to drive profit, cash flow, top quartile ROIC into the future.","Financial Services Q4 operating income shown on slide 18 was slightly lower compared to prior year. Net interest income was up $4.4 million due to higher year-over-year receivables. In Q4, there was a reporting change in which Harley-Davidson dealer systems business moved from the motorcycle segment to the Financial Services segment, Harley-Davidson dealer systems by its dealer management system software and services to the majority of our U.S. dealers. Under the leadership of HDFS, this business will leverage HDFS e-competencies related to managing dealer facing systems and servicing the U.S. dealer network.","During 2019, we expect the reporting change will increase both financial services revenue and operating expense by between $10 million to $13 million, while having only a modest impact on operating income.","HDFS's operational results are on slide 19. Q4 originations were up 8.0% versus prior year, driven by increased used motorcycle sales in the dealer network and a higher HDFS market share of new motorcycle sales.","Market share was 69.5%, up a very strong 9.6 percentage points during the quarter, driven by competitive U.S. sales rates and HDFS continued commitment to full credits from lending.","At the end of - quarter's end there were $609.2 million of cash, cash equivalents at HDFS and $1.0 billion of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facility. During 2018, HDFS paid dividends of $235 million to Harley-Davidson.","On slide 20, 30 day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our yearend balance sheet was 4.12% or 9 basis points lower than Q4 2017. The annual retail credit loss rate for receivables on a balance sheet was 1.76% or 14 basis points lower than 2017. HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position, contributed strong profitability to the company.","The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on slide 21. Our yearend cash and marketable securities balance of $526.3 over prior year and anticipation of paying off a $600 million MTN matured on January 15.","Year-to-date operating cash flow was up over $200 million or 20% from last year driven by lower working capital as we remain pretty focused and diligent on our use-of-operating cash.","Our effective tax rate was 22.6% in 2018 was considerably lower than last year driven by - driven due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act. In addition, fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from lapping last year's write-down of $53 million of deferred tax assets related to the 2017 Act.","And finally, starting liquidity company has and intends to continue maintain a minimum of 12 months of effective liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities.","Harley-Davidson's full year financial results are summarized on slide 22. Revenue net income earnings per share were all up in 2018 despite lower shipments $106.3 million charges related to our restructuring plan cost, $23.7 million due to the impact of [Technical Difficulty] an increased in SG&A and [higher recall] cost. EPS for the year was $3.19 and when excluding restructuring plan cost the impact of incremental tariffs EPS was $3.78.","We believe the charts on slide 23 demonstrate that we benchmarked very well against various peer groups in our ability to generate and return cash to shareholders period of 2015 to 2017.","One of the five objectives guiding our business strategy and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital measured by Motor Company ROIC being in the top quartile of the S&P 500 and by a best-in-class return on equity at HDFS. Harley-Davidson is a leader in ROIC at the Motor Company and ROE at HDFS is a clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders.","Slide 24 illustrates our recent history of returning cash to shareholder. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, repurchased $194.2 million of our stock. Driving superior value for stakeholders is a top priority. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends, share repurchase.","Slide 25 is a summary of our multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative. We now expect total program costs to be between $152 million to $162 million versus our most recent estimate of $155 million to $185 million.","We are also lowering our capital estimates at $65 million versus our most recent estimate of $75 million. We continue to expect our manufacturing optimization to yield ongoing cash savings of $65 million, $75 million.","In Q1, we expect manufacturing optimization cost of approximately $20 million. We believe these investments have very attractive return. When completed we expect this initiative will simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus in our operational investments and improve gross margin by roughly 1.25 percentage.","Moving on to 2019 guidance on slide 26, we expect the declines in the U.S. industry to continue into 2019, albeit at a more temperate pace than in 2018 and we expect international sales grow - as a result in 2019 we expect to ship between 2017 222,000 motorcycles which is down approximately 3% to 5% versus prior year.","During 2019 we expect retail sales to be positively impacted by, focused investment in our strategy to increase global ridership, model year 2019 and 2020 motorcycles and continued expansion of our international dealer network.","However, we expect these positives to be more than offset by strong headwinds including, the weak U.S. new bike industry, a relative shift in U.S. rider preference towards smaller motorcycles and a marketplace crowd with highly competitive promotions incentives and discounts.","In 2019 we will continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and plan for U.S. yearend inventory to be down versus 2018. We expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to be lower than prior year driven by significant increase in incremental tariffs lower volumes and unfavorable mix, partially offset by aggressive cost reductions including the benefit of $25 million to $30 million of manufacturing optimization sales.","During 2019, we expect incremental tariff cost to be approximately $100 million to $120 million. These costs include EU, China tariffs on our products shipped from the U.S., as well as U.S. tariffs on certain items coming back coming from international market. This estimate excludes metals costs, belting from U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, but we do expect for metals costs that are included in our gross margin guidance.","We intend to mitigate the impact of incremental EU and China tariffs by year end. Our plant in Thailand came online in Q3, 2018. As we explained when we announced this project in 2017 we intend to utilize it to make more of our products accessible to customers and targeted international market, including our China and ASEAN market.","As our operations in Thailand ramp up the fact that realize manufacturing efficiencies and to lower our cost of motorcycles produced there through other international markets. Looking at SG&A we expect SG&A to be lower in 2019 behind aggressive cost management and lapping 2018 recall cost.","For 2019 we have relocated substantial amount of our SG&A spending to invest in our more roads plan to drive future growth. For 2019 the motorcycle segment operating income is expected to be between 8.0% or 9.0%. Excluding the impact of incremental tariffs, manufacturing optimization cost, we expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be largely flat to 2018.","We are very focused on improving operating margin, in line with are plans we expect motorcycle segment operating income in 2022 improve by approximately $170 million to $200 million versus 2019 as we complete for manufacturing optimization and continue to address tariff impacts on our business.","We expect Financial Services operating income in 2019 to be down compared to 2018 driven by higher cost of debt and higher depreciation on our investment, a new loan management system which went live on January 1st. Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $225 million to $245 million, which includes approximately $20 million deferred manufacturing optimization.","We expect our full year effective tax rate will be approximately 24% to 25%. As we look forward to the first quarter we expect 53,000 to 58,000 motorcycles which is down approximately 9% to 17%.","Segment operating margin as a percent of revenue is expected to be down approximately 6 percentage points from Q1, 2018. We expect first quarter will be adversely affected by incremental tariffs, unfavorable mix, lost absorption on lower shipments and unfavorable currency, partially offset by lower year-over-year restructuring costs.","Despite the challenges we faced in 2018, Harley-Davidson's demonstrated its incredible resilience by growing revenue and profits, delivering significant higher year-over-year operating cash and returning $628 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","As we look beyond 2018, we are prepared for an extremely dynamic and highly competitive global market motorcycle market. We will continue to focus our investments, deliver strong returns to our shareholders and drive growth for the company over the long-term.","Thank you. And now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. I guess a question on the used bike pricing, so I think you've been talking at least fairly consistently throughout 2018 about the bike pricing improving in your dealer network and in some other auction sources that you get. But it hasn't really manifested itself seemingly in any improvement in retail sales.","So as you've looked at this historically what kind of lag is there normally? I mean when would you expect to see those used bike prices start to I guess narrow the gap so that the trade-off and [to use this] [ph] less attractive to the consumer than it seems to be today?","John Olin","Thanks Sharon. This is John. Sharon, coming out of the fourth quarter of 2014, we saw a precipitous drop in used bike prize for about 13 consecutive quarters and we have seen improvement for the last six. But the level that at which it felt for those first 13 quarters is much more than we have seen an improvement in the last several quarters.","And we still have a sizable gap and the gap between new and used is at historical levels. We expect first to see the stabilization. We've got stabilization used bike prices, next we would expect to see stabilization in the industry of new motorcycle sales.","And as we look forward to 2019, we do expect them to improve part of the reason being is behind a more stable price gap between new and used. But having said that, the gap is still wide and we still would expect the overall industry to be down.","Matt Levatich","And I'll just add Sharon, this goes back again to the focus on building new rider by creating more riders demand on the side of total supply side. So growing 50,000 additional Harley riders in 2018 is building momentum and obviously continued to invest even more behind that. As we go forward that should help dynamic.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Just one thing I know you've had this issue on other quarters. When you guys have been talking, you've been kind of drifting in and out some things have been hard to hear, so just an FYI,. John, can you just talk for a moment about your outlook for 2019 shipments and the cadence? It seems like your first quarter definitely is factoring in the challenges that you're seeing and that you've discussed on the call and then when we look forward at the second to fourth quarter, does that implies a flattish growth in shipments? So maybe first you could help us just understand, how you're thinking about the cadence throughout the year with maybe second quarter be down and then the second half be up something like that.","And then, just why are you confident in your overall outlook given the challenges that retail and the industry both internationally and domestic? And it seems like some of the international pressures are relatively new? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Felicia. As we look to the - let's start with the first quarter, as we look to the first quarter we expect shipments to be down 7% to 19%. And you're absolutely right Felicia that a portion of that is the fact that we will not be shipping - we do not expect to ship Street motorcycles in the fourth - first, I am sorry, in the first quarter. That represents about 4%, 4.5% of that total.","In addition, we expect coming out of the first quarter with lower inventories in the U.S., so we\u2019re going to continue to keep overall inventories very tight as we move into the selling season.","What we would expect from there is to see shipments really track well with retail sales and throughout the year we would expect retail sales to improve as we invest in stronger dealers which is part of our More Roads strategy. And in fact, when we look at 2019 overall we will have a significant investment in More Roads in the neighborhood of $100 million.","So to get to the final part of your question Felicia is why do we expect - why do we have confidence in the shipment guidance that we've given, is that is a big part of it. We are investing heavily in More Roads and stronger dealers and certainly the new products and broader access. And as Matt has just mentioned, we came off of 2018 creating 52,000 new riders to Harley-Davidson that weren't there a year ago. We\u2019re gaining momentum from \u201817 to \u201818 and we expect that momentum to increase and continue into 2019.","Felicia Hendrix","So just as far as the cadence goes, can you give some color there, and can you help us understand how many dealers you are adding internationally this year?","John Olin","Yes, from a standpoint of the cadence I can't provide a lot more. You've got the first quarter and we will see an improvement throughout the year. In terms of international dealers, we expect to add 25 to 35 more dealers in international markets in 2019.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","David Beckel","Hi, good morning. Just had a question about 52,000 new riders that you added this year. Can you provide us some color on maybe demographic aspects of these new riders? How they differ from your existing base and to what extent are they buying new versus used? Anything along those lines would be helpful?","Matt Levatich","Thanks, David. This is Matt. As I hope we've adequately described in the past, rider migration [Technical Difficulty] actually was last Tuesday and it begins the analysis. What we have right now is that top-level - obviously we have all need to get out of the question you asked, not surprised, the nature of our work and the focus, high leverage [Technical Difficulty] potential customers and [indiscernible] what John talked about on to guidance of sales. So it's work that we're doing right now. Obviously [Technical Difficulty] this year.","David Beckel","Got it. Thanks. And one quick follow-up if I could by what amount do you expect inventories to be down at the end of the year? I think you mentioned you expected that?","John Olin","Yes, this is John. We are not providing an exact amount. We expect overall U. S. shipments to be down and consequently, inventory will follow.","David Beckel","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point on inventories. Obviously, 350 bikes in terms of a domestic decline is a start, but it kind of feels like a drop in the bucket versus 17,000 bikes that retail was down in 2018?","So, I guess, my question John, you don't need to give us actual numbers, but it's pretty clear that inventory turns worsened materially in 2018. Is the goal to get back to the inventory turn number that you had coming into 2018 just given how much of that appears to have changed based on the numbers that you've given us?","John Olin","Thanks James. I probably wouldn't agree completely with your overall assessment, but you're absolutely right, in the fourth quarter 350 was not enough to hold year-end turns. But when you look across the entire year, actually, over the last - we have reduced inventories in each of the four quarter anywhere between 10% and 35%.","And our guidance all year long has been for flat. We came in a little bit below that and at this point we couldn't feel more comfortable with where our inventories are. Certainly our dealers echo that and all the surveys that are run, it\u2019s 80% plus that feel comfortable or that they have too little inventory.","So, we have absolutely no issues with where we're at with regards to inventory in the mix considerably better than last year. Again, as I had mentioned to Felicia we'll continue - pressure on overall inventories and we will take inventories down in the first quarter in the United States, but we feel very comfortable where that - we're at. To answer your final question, we'd be looking to hold turn\u2026","James Hardiman","I'm sorry you broke up there. Your aim is to hold turns?","John Olin","I'm sorry, 2019 would be the hold turns constant versus\u2026","James Hardiman","Versus 2018 or versus 2017?","John Olin","No, versus 2018. 2019, we'll look to hold turns to 2018.","James Hardiman","Right. But the 2018 turns were a lot worse than 2017, right? I mean, maybe\u2026","John Olin","Just went through that. There are four quarter of the year. The turns were better in the three of the four quarter. In the fourth quarter, we talked about this as well, push back our surge manufacturing - [indiscernible] a lot of efficiencies plus reductions in our plans.","Out of December into January, right now we feel very comfortable where inventories are. Our dealers certainly feel the same [indiscernible] feel pressure that they're too little and we'll continue to manage turns at this rate as we go forward. And\u2026","James Hardiman","I apologize. You're cutting in and out John. But it sounds like you're saying that inventory turns didn't get worse in 2018? I mean, I think about 350 bikes that's may be a 1% decline versus a 10% retail decline. Am I not thinking about that the right way?","John Olin","James I told you that in the fourth quarter turns got worse. In the other three quarters, they got better. We sell products throughout the four quarters of the year. We've kept turns - turns got a little bit worse in the fourth quarter and consequently on a full year basis because of manufacturing.","We pushed back our surge manufacturing to gain additional efficiencies and we feel very comfortable where yearend inventories are this year. Next year, we will reduce inventories in United States as we expect shipments to also reduce because of a weak U.S. industry thereby holding turns on a year-over-year basis from 2019 to 2018.","James Hardiman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's on Thailand. Can you shed more light on the timing of additional capacity in Thailand? What do you think your eventual capacity will be from a unit perspective? How long is that going to take to ramp up? And just remind us which markets you plan to serve from that facility?","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Craig. Craig we\u2019re currently investing and expanding the capacity of our Thailand facility and we expect to be producing the majority of our motorcycles for the EU, China and Asian markets by the end of this year. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you. John, I don't know if you've cut out there again. But in all honestly you guys the call quality here is pretty poor. There's a lot of cutting in and out on the whole call. But did you say expecting to produce the majority of those by year-end was that your last part of your response to Craig's question?","John Olin","I'm sorry. Sorry for the poor audio quality. Yes, by the end of this year we will have the capacity in our Thailand facility to be shipping and the amount of capacity to cover our needs in the EU, China and ASEAN markets by the end of this year. Over that, we expect overall tariff cost to be $100 million to $120 million in 2019 and we would expect those to come out in 2020 as we would be producing from our Thailand facility at the end of this year.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. Thank you. So from a cost perspective is this included within the manufacturing optimization that you all outlined earlier in the call? Those costs for the Thai facility, just want to clarify that?","Matt Levatich","Thanks, Tim. No, they are not included in that. The manufacturing optimization is largely the consolidation of our two final assembly plants in the United States moving Casey to York and exiting a wheel manufacturing plant in Australia. With that, we are well on the path to completing that project which will be completed later this year and deliver separate savings of $25 million to $30 million for this year and then building up to $65 million to $75 million of savings.","Tim Conder","Okay. That's helpful. So with that and what is the cost for the Thai investment ramp what's included in the guidance this year related to the Thailand plant? And again, expansion in the ramping-related costs.","John Olin","Right. So the Thailand plant again was something that we announced back in 2017 and the plant was completed and came online in the third quarter of last year of 2018. And that was the bulk of the spending on that plan. Given the fact that we are now looking to supply additional markets from Thailand, we're expanding that plant and that's a cost increase in both operating expense as well as capital. The capital investment in 2019 is about $15 million.","Tim Conder","And from a ramping cost the inefficiency cost, however you want to frame it any color there John?","John Olin","It will be a higher cost. I don't have that number in front of me. But it is a manageable cost by the company.","Tim Conder","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with MorningStar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the financing landscape outside of HDFS that looks you guys are taking a larger share of lending domestically? And I'm curious if that's because it's maybe backed off from other originators or if you guys have seen just a different opportunity set for that part of the business? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Jaime. We don't see a big change in the competitive set in lending. Remember that most of the people lending on motorcycles are only lending in the top-tier prime segment and not in sub-prime. But we haven't seen a dramatic change and the next largest competitor Harley-Davidson is very small. So I don't think we would really discern a big change.","And what you're seeing being at this year and you've seen it for the last three or four consecutive years is HDFS doing an absolute fantastic job of delivering to our dealers, integrating into their business process and being very high-quality at what they do. And that is garnering the share that you're seeing. It couldn't be more happy and for that I'll put a plug-in for HDFS.","They had a record earnings year and it was done in an absolutely fantastic way and they grew revenues 2.2% despite the fact that new motorcycle sales in United States were down and they improved the delinquencies as well as credit losses. So we're very pleased with the business there including a market share that they have garnered.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then can you guys talk a little about the 52,000 domestic riders. We are now three years into this program to get two million new domestic riders by 2027 and obviously the math gets harder every year you fall short of 10% for whatever if you want to divide it evenly.","So is the implication that the market will stabilize and that get much better or that the products was just attracted that many more customers to help you meet your goal as you think about it longer term? Thank you.","Matt Levatich","Yes. This is Matt. When we put the two million riders goal out it really was a stake in the ground to get the attention of the organization and the dealer network about the work we had to do. It was prior to have any insights that we now are able to gain with the rider migration database, talk a little bit about that earlier.","We increased the number of Harley-Davidson riders ultimately what we are after and everything that we doing, the exact math doesn't necessarily correlate to the two million, but to put a little bit of perspective on the next 52,000 increase, it came as a result of people entering the sport on Harley and it came as a result of people exiting the sport.","We brought in 278,000 new riders Harley-Davidson [Audio Gap] in 2018 that exceeded the number of people that exited by 52,000. And so when we look at the task that we have and all of our efforts under More Roads, it's really about two things, it's about bringing in new riders inspiring them with new kinds of products like what's represented in our full EV portfolio and the middle-weight platform.","And it's about keeping existing riders \u2013 and riding longer. I mentioned the ride 365 -- 137 -- number of riders. So we're focused as an organization on the test to build riders. I think the challenge that we have with connecting 2 million new riders the insights we now had about writer migration is something we will continue to dimensionalize for everybody.","But I think the important message is, we are making progress, increasing the number of Harley riders and we expect More Roads to accelerate that trend as well as capitalize on global market for the company.","Jaime Katz","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joe Altobello","Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I guess first question is just a clarification on the Q1 guidance and I apologize the call has been going in and out. But I think you guys said operating margin for the Motor Company in the first quarter down 600 basis points. Is that a report number or is that excluding restructuring cost and tariffs?","John Olin","No, that's a reported number. So all in GAAP reporting we would expect Q1 operating margin at the Motor Company to be down about six percentage points driven by the incremental tariffs in particular, but the shipments being down 9% to 17% as well as unfavorable mix.","Joe Altobello","Got it. Okay. And then secondly sort of a broader question, this is -- as you mentioned the sixth quarter in a row where the gap between new and used pricing has gotten better, still wide but getting better. How much of that gap is due to a lack of what the consumer perceives as meaningful incremental innovation in the motorcycle industry? And how much of that do you think is an affordability issue where the average consumer just can't afford a $20000 vehicle?","John Olin","With regards to, I don't know what the separation of those two are. I just think that we're in a situation that when a value buyer is looking at a motorcycle they can receive a 2 year-old Harley-Davidson at a very attractive price. And they're willing to forgo some of the innovation and the larger engines and some of the features and benefits that we've put down over the last two years just because of a very large price gap.","And again we are pleased to start to see that stabilize and start to improve a little bit. But there still is, as we talked about before there still is a large gap and value buyers are choosing used motorcycles.","Joe Altobello","Is there a thought to maybe taking a more drastic approach to pricing; meaning, lowering the price of new bikes to kind of lower that gap and hopefully attract more riders?","Matt Levatich","This is Matt. I would say the approach is rather continued to invest value of [Technical Difficulty]-really smart content - some of that - that speaks sort of trade-offs existing sort of pool of buyers and then when you look at every More Roads - no way platform and e-portfolios, you're speaking of totally different -- of rider.","So this is what, why the strategy going forward and we explained it was products and broader access for stronger dealers. Just to dimensionalize the middle-weight segments that we'll be entering; Adventure Touring and Streetfighter.","Today the company's heavyweight cover in major global markets is about 43%. Those are the 43% of the heavyweight segments we participate in with Touring and Cruiser. When we add streetfighter and Adventure Touring to our mix that will more than double or about double our coverage, as far as the heavyweight segment.","This is the power of us entering the segment speaking to different rider in addition more interesting to reach out to new riders and inspire people to ride, primarily I would say through the EV portfolio but everything else we're doing with content as well.","So product plays a major role, but hand in hand with broader [Technical Difficulty] what we're about and make sure that they are broad in business into the experience, fantastic experience.","Joe Altobello","Got it. Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Yes. Just on the international side, you called out weak consumer confidence in the U.K. and France. So, when could you start to see some weakness in those two markets and have you seen any stabilization yet?","John Olin","Yes, thanks Greg. We have been very pleased with our business in Europe. We're picking up market share growing obviously faster than the market and it's been very widespread throughout the European countries. It's really just in the fourth quarter that we saw the softness in the U.K. and we believe that is a function in part due to Brexit and then in France due to the yellow jacket demonstration.","So hopefully, this is something that will pass quickly certainly Brexit is still up for decision, but John we're keeping a close eye on them. But other than that Europe continues to perform very strong and we've been very pleased with it and new Softail motorcycles have been really good sellers all year long.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. And also just any may be on the feedback on the customer response to LiveWire that launch, anything incremental that you're hiring?","Matt Levatich","This is Matt. Thanks for the question. I think it's been a fantastic response, as I mentioned in my opening comments. But between Milan than at the [Technical Difficulty] we had not only LiveWire displayed in development prototypes in our lightweight space. And then most recently last weekend at the [Technical Difficulty] significant positive response outside of [Technical Difficulty] in all three cases outside of just the motorcycle space.","So people are noticing what we're doing there. They're looking at Harley-Davidson in a different way and that is very important as part of our strategy to kind of change peoples perspectives about how often riding can [Technical Difficulty]. The feedback on LiveWire has been exceptional and people haven't [Technical Difficulty] more excitement about LiveWire and the rest of the portfolio.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gerrick Johnson","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to be clear about the tariff impacts that you're excluding from EPS in the quarter and going forward. Is this the gross impact or is this the net impact of pricing and other actions? Is it just 301 and reciprocal does that include 232 and if it does include 232 how do you estimate that? Thank you.","John Olin","For the quarter, we had approximately 20 -- I'm sorry, 2018 approximately $26 million tariffs. Those will be 301 and reciprocal in your terms Gerrick. That does not include metals. We do believe that we experienced higher metals costs. Overall raw material costs were up $17 million on the year.","We believe the primary driver of that was the tariffs, but that's not included in how we are defining our actual tariffs for 2018 of $26 billion and on a similar basis, we expect that $26 million to be between $100 million and $120 million in 2019 when we look at the full year impact of tariffs of our products through the EU of our shipments to China and of tariffs that are coming back from international markets primarily China in the United States on the incremental tariffs that have been placed on those products.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. So just one more point of clarification. Is that a gross number or are those that number after pricing actions and other actions?","John Olin","That's a gross number -- gross amount of incremental tariffs. That's not the total tariffs. That's just the increase, largely of the 25 percentage points in the EU and in China and in a lot of cases 10% to 25% back in the United States. Not the entire tariff, but it's just the incremental piece and it does not include any other items in there such as pricing.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. But when you report earnings going forward, you're going to report earnings excluding the total impact of tariffs not the incremental. So can we talk about the total gross impact?","John Olin","The amount of tariffs going forward will be reported - estimated at $100 million to $120 million. That is 301 tariffs of our shipments into the EU into China which have incremental tariffs of 25 percentage points. We are only reporting the 25 percentage points incremental.","And for the tariffs coming back largely from China and in United States those tariffs range from 10% to 25% increase. We're only going to report that increase. We are reporting it the same way that we reported $26 million in 2018 to 2019.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s very clear. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thanks.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Tamberrino","Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to understand on the international dealer build out, it says 56 new dealers. Is that a net increase or were there some that closed? I'm asking because I'm just trying to understand the average inventory levels internationally as full year retail sales were essentially flat at 95000 units, international shipments were essentially flat may be down a touch at 96000 units. But you added 56 new dealers. So has there been inventory reduction at the existing international dealers and is that finished? Thanks.","John Olin","Yes overall, David, the 56 dealers that we opened internationally, there is a limited number of offsets to that, a handful or two offset to that. Overall, when we look at international inventories, we are up on several hundred units on a year-over-year basis and that would imply that overall inventories are down in the same stores internationally.","David Tamberrino","Okay. I mean is that -- do you feel like you're right sized for your inventory internationally given what you're seeing from a retail sales perspective or could that continue in 2019?","John Olin","We feel good about where the overall inventories are. The fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected on retail sales and instead of shipping in those and holding on to guidance, we decided not to build inventory beyond what we had planned which was up. And in addition to that we decided to take down primarily our international inventories as well and that's why we missed our shipment.","So it's good about were inventories are internationally. And when will look to 2019 we would expect international inventories to be largely flat on a year-over-year basis despite us adding 25 to 35 new dealerships.","And remember in six short quarters we're going to be adding a plethora of new products under our More Roads plan or an as Matt had mentioned and Adventure Touring, Streetfighter and the traditional segment we want to make sure that our dealers are ready to receive those vehicles.","David Tamberrino","Understood. Thanks, John.","Shannon Burns","All right, thanks everyone. There are a few questions remaining in the queue. And I will follow-up with each of the analyst we did not have a chance to get to. Due to some sound quality challenges we will post our comments on the website before transcripts are available.","The audio and slides for today's call will be available at harley-davidson.com or for the audio call 855 859-2056 or 404-537-3406 until February 12.

Click Company at the top of the home page, then Investor Relations and Events and Presentations.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call. ","This morning our President and CEO, Matt Levatich, and CFO John Olin will be hosting the call. Matt, let\u2019s get started.","Matthew Levatich","Thanks Amy, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today I\u2019ll provide you with context on our quarterly results as we work our long-term strategy to build the next generation of Harley Davidson riders. John will then review the financials and forward expectations in greater detail. ","Overall, our third quarter results demonstrate ongoing U.S. industry headwinds persist as the U.S. industry continued to decline. There is no doubt that our focus on building new riders and accessing new markets globally is key to our success long term, and we\u2019re increasing the focus and intensity of our work to these ends. While this is clearly our true north, we\u2019re committed to making the critical business decisions necessary to manage through the prolonged weakness in this key market.","Our international performance in the third quarter was also down as we continued to weather isolated issues in some of our larger markets, particularly in Asia Pacific. Last quarter, we outlined three distinct actions we\u2019re taking to position the company strength despite the global industry trends. First, we\u2019re addressing issues in the U.S. through disciplined supply management. Second, we\u2019re aggressively managing our business cost structure; and third, we continue to invest in our long-term strategy. I\u2019ll provide an update on these three actions and talk about where we stand today.","First, we pulled back on shipments in a very measured way to help dealers focus on selling through model year 2017 bikes to be sure they had appropriate levels of carryover inventory as we launched the most significant product development project in our history. While we believe limiting model year 2018 product had a negative impact on retail sales in the U.S., we could not be more pleased with our U.S. retail inventory position. Discipline to this principle is not easy, but maintaining channel profitability and customer value is a key part of the loyalty that\u2019s so important to our company and brand. Importantly, we see tremendous interest for our 2018 models and we expect that there will be lasting positive impact.","Second, we reduced our production rate in line with forward demand projections, and we continued to aggressively manage our cost structure with a focus on our SG&A investments. ","Third, we\u2019re all in on our quest to build the next generation of Harley Davidson riders globally. We have the strategies, the plans and the people to drive our singular imperative and grow our business long term. ","Now, I\u2019d like to highlight a few actions we took in the quarter to drive performance in line with our five key objectives. Let\u2019s start with high impact new products.","Our model year 2018 line-up features the new ground-up redesign of our large cruisers, the all-new Softails, the most significant new product investment in our 115 year history. The eight potently styled 2018 Softail models merge the hard-hitting performance of the Dynas with the unmistakable custom look of our Softails and take both to a new level. Featuring a significantly lighter chassis to harness the power and torque of the new smooth-running dual counterbalanced Milwaukee-8 107 and 114 engines, each bike offers a meaningful performance enhancement for every rider need, acceleration, cornering, braking speed, comfort and confidence-inspiring handling. These bikes were built to make the ride that much better for riders. Our bikes are the cornerstone of our strategy to build riders, built to inspire existing riders to ride more, competitive owners to join our brand, and the next generation of riders to join in. ","The press has been amazing. We reached more than 150 million impressions across traditional and social media channels and garnered positive coverage and buzz from the mainstream to industry media and from the critics to the converted. We received universal praise, like the coverage from Maxim which said, new technology with trademark heritage style has long been Harley\u2019s recipe for success, and the 2018 Softail family looks like a great dish from that cookbook.","We didn\u2019t stop with Softail. We also launched two new touring bikes, three new CVO models, and a sportster for a total of 14 new high impact motorcycles in model year \u201918 alone. Add to that our 115th anniversary bikes offered in limited quantities and two statement paint schemes, and our commitment to product to drive ridership has never been clearer, never been stronger, never been higher impact.","Our entire 2018 line is geared toward inspiring the next generation of Harley Davidson riders because great product is the foundation of a great ride, and while new product is certainly a highlight for all of us here at Harley, what we\u2019re really about is riders and creating opportunities to inspire and build that next generation. ","The Harley Davidson Riding Academy is a direct investment in creating new riders in the U.S., and it augments the efforts of the Motorcycle Safety Foundation and state-sponsored rider training courses. In the quarter, we trained more than 19,000 riders, which brings us to just over 51,000 year-to-date. One of our key goals with Riding Academy is to enhance its effectiveness at creating active riders, and we\u2019re thrilled to see sales of motorcycles to Riding Academy graduates in the third quarter are up double digits over prior year.","We also activated our partnership with Eagle Rider to enhance the way a newly trained or returning rider can seek out their perfect bike through an extended trial while also providing riders from around the world enhanced rental, travel and tour experiences. The Eagle Rider rollout is well underway with more dealer locations to come.","We also have several pilots in place to evaluate how we can enhance the rider development path. We know that becoming a rider is a journey. It takes inspiration, dedication, and a community of support. We already have ingredients at the ready through our dealer network, including training, financing, great gear, availability of affordable new and used bikes, and importantly our community of passionate riders. These pilots are helping to validate our thinking for how best to pull the ingredients together to accelerate our rider creation efforts.","Internationally, our focus remains on growth through extended market reach and greater impact with brand awareness and product. One way we\u2019re driving brand reach and impact is through our Battle of the Kings customization competition in Europe. This contest promotes our incredible dealer network and vast range of parts and accessories, and reaches a younger demographic all while driving sales. EMEA dealers collected more than 12,000 leads and drove customer engagement through 80,000 votes online. ","We also reached riders and demonstrated the strength of our model year 2018 line through demo rides at the 20th anniversary of European Bike Week. The event had record attendance of more than 125,000 people and more than 70,000 riders. I was a the inaugural event and it\u2019s staggering to see how it\u2019s grown in both numbers and passion over the years. ","To reach new and existing riders internationally, we continue to increase access with capable, brand dedicated dealers in more locations. Fifteen new dealerships opened this quarter in South Korea, Thailand, El Salvador, Germany and Russia, to name a few. Broader brand awareness through emerging Asian markets is also well underway with our new apparel partner. Plans are in place to open more than 100 stores over four years, beginning in 2018 with the first locations opening in China, Malaysia and India. ","While our industry here in the U.S. is facing some significant challenges, we see opportunity to better leverage our substantial strengths to move forward at full throttle. Our goal to build 2 million riders over the next decade is a clear and powerful motivator for our company, dealers and passionate riders. While the U.S. is a mature motorcycle market, we\u2019re investing to grow it. As the motorcycle industry leader with 115 years of experience, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to build ridership and strengthen the sport of motorcycling over time. ","We\u2019ll continue to advance our reach and impact internationally where the biggest opportunity for long term growth for our brand and company clearly resides, and we\u2019ll continue to make whatever tough calls are necessary to optimize near-term business performance while remaining clear, focused and driven to invest wisely for the long term health of our brand and company. Success in this effort is critical to all stakeholders and we certainly know that it is for you, our shareholders.","Now John will walk you through the financials and the details on the quarter. Thank you. ","John Olin","Thanks Matt. As discussed, in the third quarter the U.S. industry continued to face significant challenges. In addition, international retail sales finished below our expectations. During the quarter, we achieved our goal of significantly reducing U.S. retail inventory and we are experiencing the intended market response to the tightened availability, which I will talk more about. We are confident that we are taking the actions necessary to navigate the current environment, and we believe that executing our long-term strategy supports a vibrant, long term global outlook for our business.","The summary of third quarter financial results starts on Slide 12. Our financial results reflect our decision to slow production and shipments in response to U.S. industry weakness. During the quarter, revenue was $1.15 billion, net income was $68.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.40. Compared to last year, Q3 motorcycle segment operating income was down $89.3 million. Revenue was down 11.9% behind 14.3% lower motorcycle shipments. As we slowed production in the quarter, gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased significantly versus the prior year. SG&A spending was slightly lower during this year\u2019s third quarter despite increased marketing and product development investment. ","At HDFS, operating income in the third quarter was up $7.6 million or 11.0% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected a lower effective tax rate, and importantly year-to-date cash from operations was up $21.3 million or 2.3% despite year-to-date net income being down 20.4%. We remain focused on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term.","Moving onto worldwide retail sales on Slide 13, in Q3 worldwide retail sales of new Harley Davidson motorcycles were down 6.9% versus prior year. While the decline was substantial, it was generally in line with our expectations. In the U.S., Q3 retail sales were down versus prior year, we believe driven by very weak U.S. industry sales of new motorcycles partially offset by market share gains. International retail sales were down behind significant weakness in Japan, Australia, and Mexico. Given the lower than anticipated Q3 results, we no longer expect international growth in the second half of this year. While Q3 international sales were below our expectations, we believe that our strong brand, products and distribution will drive sustainable growth in the international markets over time. We remain committed to our long term international growth strategy.","We are thrilled with the positive response to our motorcycles, our U.S. dealer inventory position, the expansion of our international dealer network as well as the progress we are making to expand riders globally. We continue to work hard to protect and reinforce the strength of the Harley Davidson brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand. Our discipline to reduce inventory in the U.S. is on track and we are maintaining our shipment guidance. ","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the U.S. on Slide 14. In the U.S., retail sales were within our expectations but still down 8.1%. We believe the decline in retail sales was driven by a very weak industry partially offset by market share gains. The industry was down 9.2% in the third quarter, which represents the eighth consecutive quarter of industry weakness. We believe the industry was adversely impacted by soft used bike prices and the hurricanes that hit Texas and the southeast. While soft used bike pricing is a headwind to new bike sales, year-to-date sales of used Harley Davidson motorcycles were up through August and continued to perform significantly better than new retail sales in the U.S. When looking at new and used Harley Davidson motorcycles combined, our year-to-date share of the total registered motorcycles also increased through August.","During Q3, used bike wholesale prices at auction remained firm to year-ago values and pricing services, such as NADA and Black Book continued to publish higher values year-over-year for Harley Davidson motorcycles. We were very pleased to see used Harley Davidson retail prices increase in the broader market, particularly in our dealer network, after being down for 12 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, the hurricanes adversely impacted the industry in Q3. While it is very difficult to isolate, we estimate the impact of the hurricanes accounted for approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage points of Harley Davidson\u2019s retail sales decline during the quarter. ","Moving on to market share, Harley Davidson\u2019s market share in the quarter was up 0.8 percentage points to 53.1%. We are pleased with the share gains despite a very competitive environment. We believe the U.S. market share gains in the quarter were driven by the strong demand for our large cruisers behind the introduction of the new Softail motorcycles and sales to Eagle Rider as they establish their initial fleet of new Harley Davidson rental motorcycles. We believe these market share gains would have been higher had it not been for our planned actions to significantly constrain availability across all Harley Davidson motorcycle platforms. ","Last quarter, we decided to significantly reduce the flow of new motorcycles into the channel in an effort to operate with a much tighter U.S. retail inventory in the face of an uncertain industry. Throughout the quarter, U.S. retail motorcycle inventory was down 20 to 30%, and we believe retail sales were adversely impacted as a result of limited availability. U.S. retail inventory at the end of the quarter was down approximately 12,200 motorcycles compared to prior year. We continue to expect 2017 year-end U.S. retail inventory will be down versus 2016. We remain committed to aggressively managing supply in line with demand. We believe this discipline will ultimately result in stronger retail sales and increased market efficiency. ","Turning to new products, we were very pleased with the reception to our completely redesigned Softail motorcycle platform, which replaces three former platforms. In the quarter, the eight new 2018 Softail models had a significantly higher sell-through rate compared to the rate of last year\u2019s 11 models of Softail, Dyna and V-Rod during third quarter of 2016. In addition, our market share of cruisers was up nearly 5.5 percentage points in September. We believe this demonstrates increased consumer appeal with reduced complexity. We expect reduce complexity to also improve the dealer sales process, enhance our customers\u2019 purchase experience, and drive manufacturing productivity with lower capital investment.","On Slide 15, you\u2019ll see Q3 retail sales in our international markets were down 4.6% behind substantial weakness in Japan, Australia and Mexico. Except for these markets, developed markets generally performed well and emerging markets were up, with sales momentum growing over the last three quarters. Looking forward, we expect international retail sales will benefit from full availability of Street Rod, increasing availability of model year 2018 motorcycles, an expanding dealer network and relatively easier year-over-year comps. ","In EMEA, Q3 retail sales were down modestly versus prior year. Growth in Europe was offset by declines in the Middle East and Africa. Underlying demand remains strong in Europe, especially for the new Milwaukee-8 powered bikes and Street Rod. Initial retail sales of the new Softails have been very positive. Europe market share in the third quarter was 9.8%, up 0.3 points versus prior year. On a year-to-date basis, market share was 9.6%, down 0.6 points. The industry was up 2.4% through the first nine months of the year.","In Asia Pacific, Q3 retail sales were down 6.7% from the prior year, adversely impacted by lower sales in our developed markets of Australia and Japan. Conversely, in aggregate emerging markets in the region have been gaining significant momentum and were quite strong in Q3. Retail sales in Latin America were down 11.5%, driven by steep decline in Mexico partially offset by gains in Brazil. Retail sales in Mexico have weakened significantly in part due to the earthquakes near Mexico City. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 3.3% in a highly competitive environment. ","We remain confident in our international growth prospects. In support of our strategy to increase brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. Through September, 35 new international dealerships have opened this year. ","On Slide 16, you\u2019ll see wholesale motorcycle shipments were down 14.3% in the quarter and within our shipment guidance range. Third quarter shipment mix skewed significantly toward cruisers, reflecting our investment in the new Softail motorcycles.","On Slide 17, you will see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was down in the third quarter behind lower year-over-year motorcycle shipments. The average motorcycle revenue per unit was down $546 for the quarter as we shipped more cruisers as a percent of the total compared to last year, partially offset by higher pricing and favorable currency exchange. ","Wholesale and MSRP weighted average pricing for our new model year 2018 motorcycles increased approximately 3%. Adjusting for the cost of the new content, pricing net of cost increased approximately one percentage point expressed as a percent of revenue. For the quarter, P&A revenue was largely flat; however, it significantly outperformed motorcycle revenue on a percentage basis driven by increased sales in our international markets. General merchandise revenue was up 11.3% on strong sales of our 115th anniversary offerings and our new 1903 collection, which expands customer appeal of our merchandise.","Our gross margin review is on Slide 18. Gross margin in Q3 was down on lower motorcycle shipments, unfavorable mix, higher raw materials and manufacturing costs partially offset by higher pricing and favorable currency. Mix was unfavorable as we shipped in a much higher mix of cruisers versus last year\u2019s heavy mix of touring. Raw materials costs were higher during the quarter behind rising steel and aluminum costs. Currency exchange was favorable behind a weaker U.S. dollar. Manufacturing costs were significantly higher due to lost absorption of fixed expenses on substantially lower production during the quarter, and higher start-up costs related to the launch of our all-new Softail motorcycles. ","Q3 gross margin was down more than expected behind a less rich product mix and as we experienced higher than expected start-up costs related to the magnitude of new product content and supplier coordination. While our manufacturing line start-up was slower than we anticipated, we were up to planned line rates by the end of the quarter. ","On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q3 was 2.0%, down compared to last year. Operating margin was adversely impacted by significantly lower gross margin. SG&A was slightly lower than prior year despite increased marketing and product development investments which were largely offset by aggressive expense management. Profitability remains a key focus, and we believe we can further leverage our established capabilities to continue to drive profit and strong ROIC in the future.","Moving on to HDFS on Slide 20, during the quarter HDFS operating profit increased $7.6 million or 11.0% compared to last year. The primary factors driving Q3 results were: first, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses decreased by $7.3 million from last year, driven by a smaller increase in the allowance as compared to Q3 of 2016. It is important to note that we expect credit losses to be incurred because of the impact of the hurricanes. We would expect these losses to be largely reserved for in the fourth quarter. Next, HDFS experienced positive results in other income largely due to higher licensing revenue. Finally, HDFS incurred higher operating expenses during the quarter. ","HDFS\u2019 operational results are on Slide 21. For the quarter, originations were down 7.5% compared to last year, and market share was down 5.7 percentage points during the quarter as we lapped a significantly higher level of finance offers in Q3 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $372.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.32 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. During the quarter, HDFS paid HD Inc. a dividend of $90 million. ","On Slide 22, you will see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our balance sheet at the end of September was 3.72% or 11 basis points higher than Q3 2016. The annualized retail credit loss rate for receivables on our balance sheet was 1.73% or 14 basis points higher than Q3 2016. Overall, credit losses continue to be higher across the portfolio, which is consistent with vehicle financing industry trends. While both 30-day delinquency and credit losses were up in the quarter, we are pleased that the rate of increase for both tempered from last year. HDFS continued to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company. ","The remaining Harley Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 23. A few things to note - year-to-date operating cash flow was up from last year, driven by lower wholesale financing partially offset by lower net income. The year-to-date tax rate was 33.2%, down from the second quarter of 2017 due to reduced tax reserves as we realized a higher percentage of spending qualifying for the R&D tax credit and behind the successful completion of two audits in the quarter. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. ","Turning to Slide 24, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We are committed to delivering motor company ROIC in the top quartile of the S&P 500 through disciplined investments and a best-in-class ROE at HDFS. We will continue to look for opportunities to deliver shareholder value by investing to maximize the long-term value of the company and the brand, and by returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares for $222 million. ","On Slide 25, you will see full-year expectations for 2017. We continue to expect to ship 241,000 to 246,000 motorcycles in 2017, which is down 6% to 8% compared to last year. Our shipment guidance takes into account our expectation of lower U.S. retail inventories compared to 2016. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship 46,700 to 51,700 motorcycles, which is up approximately 10% to 22% compared to last year. Given Q3 gross margin results, we now expect full year gross margin to be down versus our previous expectation of down modestly. Conversely, we now expect full-year SG&A as a percent of revenue to be flat versus our previous expectation of up slightly. ","We now expect our full-year 2017 effective tax rate will be approximately 33.4%. All other full-year expectations included on Slide 25 remain unchanged.","To wrap up, in the face of current challenges, we continue to execute our strategies and make the necessary decisions to support our brand and profitability into the future. We are encouraged by the strength of our brand and the appeal of our products demonstrated by the positive response to our 2018 motorcycles, and we were particularly pleased to see the positive results of our supply management discipline. They are hard decisions, but the third quarter provided solid reinforcement of our efforts to protect our brand premium and maintain appropriate inventory. Finally, year-to-date cash flow from operations was up despite lower net income, highlighting our ability to generate significant operating cash in the face of very difficult market conditions.","To build the next generation of Harley Davidson riders globally, we have the right strategies that are appropriately funded, and we are disciplined in our execution. We will prudently focus on our investments, deliver strong returns to our investors, and sustain the company for the long term. ","With that, let\u2019s take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning. You guys have made tremendous improvement in your product and there\u2019s been a positive response, but the conjecture out there is it\u2019s just not working, it\u2019s just not moving the needle. What do you say to that, and why do you think it hasn\u2019t been driving sales growth for you guys? ","John Olin","Well Gerrick, as we look at--I would assume that you\u2019re referring to the new Softail models, and to be honest, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace in the first couple months. So first to understand exactly what the strategy was behind that product, it was to take three previous platforms, which were the old Softail, Dyna and V-Rod, which we had 11 models of in the previous year, and we came out with eight new Softails that were highly differentiated and covered all the need states that the previous models did without the overlap between families, so we believe that form a customer standpoint is much easier for the customer to understand and choose a motorcycle, highly differentiated versus the three platforms that we had before. ","Again, when we look at the initial sales results, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. If you look at retail sales of new Softail this year versus last year\u2019s three families of Dyna, Softail and V-Rod, we actually sold double the number of retail sales this year versus last year on a third fewer models; so again, we are very excited as to where we\u2019re at with regards to those models and are not seeing what you had mentioned at all.","From an international standpoint--","Gerrick Johnson","Let me just stop you for a second. I\u2019m also talking about the models that were launched last year. You had a brand-new engine platform that\u2019s been out there for a year, and we haven\u2019t seen much improvement there either on the touring side. ","John Olin","Well, when we look at overall touring, sales over those quarters that it\u2019s been out have been--retail sales have been up in touring and market share has been up quite significantly, Gerrick. What hasn\u2019t happened is--well, that\u2019s in an industry and a market that\u2019s underlying been down about 7%, so Milwaukee-8 has done what we expected, dramatically outperforming the industry, gaining market share. The issue that we\u2019ve been facing, Gerrick, all along is a very soft industry, and the industry has been down for eight consecutive quarters, and in particular the last six quarters it\u2019s averaged down about 7% - matter of fact, it\u2019s 6.75%. So under that backdrop, Milwaukee-8 has performed very well.","Matthew Levatich","I\u2019d just add, Gerrick, too that in both cases, the product plays very strongly internationally. First of all, the opportunity that we have with growth in touring, that the performance of both the suspension and the engine provides to the more performance oriented European customer, and the current mix of large cruiser sales is much higher internationally than it is in the United States. The early supply availability lags what it was in the United States, so we expect to see continued good performance as the availability of Softail increases internationally as well as we continue to leverage the touring product in our marketing and in our programs throughout international markets. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. Two questions, the second is really quick. On the inventory at the dealer level, it\u2019s obviously been really well managed. I\u2019m just curious, as you end this year, as you look into 2018, do you expect shipments to kind of move lockstep with retail sales, or do you see there\u2019s an opportunity for shipments to outpace what\u2019s happening on the retail end given the inventory being down so much? Then secondarily on the mix, should we assume that mix will continue to be a negative into the fourth quarter on the cruisers being so well received?","John Olin","Thanks Sharon, this is John. With regards to the tight situation of inventory, we do expect that to continue into next year. We will continue to maintain a very tight inventory level in the U.S. as long as the industry remains soft and uncertain.","Now, having said that, when we look at shipments versus retail sales next year, there is an opportunity to ship in at a little bit higher rate just because of the way we\u2019re taking the inventory out this year. We\u2019ve said that this year, we would finish with inventory down quite a bit at year end and we will, and we would need to ship in a little bit more in terms of a percent next year or we would run inventory way too low at the end of 2018. But that\u2019s not to be confused with the fact that overall inventory levels will remain tight through the fourth quarter and into 2018.","The second question that you had, Sharon, is with regards to mix in Q4. No, we expect to continue to ship a good level of cruisers in because they\u2019re selling very well, but overall we would expect mix to be favorable in the fourth quarter. Again, when we took our shipment guidance down in the second quarter and we wanted to get as much of the inventory out in the third quarter, we took a fair amount of inventory or shipments out and production out of touring, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the unfavorable mix that you\u2019re seeing this quarter - mix was unfavorable about $27 million, and that was largely due to pulling out touring. We will increase the level of touring in the fourth quarter and would expect positive mix in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. John, I know you broke out and you quantified for us the impact of the hurricanes on retail registrations in the quarter, and I appreciate that that was helpful. Can you help us understand how Eagle Rider maybe had benefited the retail registrations?","John Olin","Sure, Felicia. I think we mentioned--well, not think, we mentioned on the last call that we entered into a relationship and a partnership with Eagle Rider and with that, we were going to exit our authorized rentals and team up with Eagle Rider and sell--our dealers would sell to Eagle Rider new Harley Davidson motorcycles, which is a tremendous benefit because prior to that, Eagle Rider could not buy new motorcycles. So a lot of benefits of that relationship, but that was announced early in the first quarter and we saw authorized rentals coming out of the first quarter being down, and in the second quarter is when we finalized--I\u2019m sorry, in the beginning of the third quarter, we finalized things with Eagle Rider and we started to ship to them. So really, what we saw in the third quarter was their initial fleet being established of new Harley Davidson motorcycles that made up for the decline that we had in the first half as dealers that were part of authorized rentals stopped purchasing because of the transition to Eagle Rider.","So the way to think about it is that in the first quarter, market share was a little bit soft because of the fact that we weren\u2019t selling a lot of authorized rentals as people waited for Eagle Rider, and then in the third quarter we started to ship into Eagle Rider and that did benefit share in the third quarter. But overall, we\u2019re up slightly on a year-to-date basis.","The other thing to note, Felicia, as well, it\u2019s a very important business but it\u2019s not a tremendous amount of overall shipments. You\u2019re talking a few percent on an annual basis that go into either authorized rentals or now Eagle Rider.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","First of all, a clarification on Eagle Rider. Was that mostly model year \u201917 product, or did they take any \u201918 product? Then my question is really with regard to the SG&A and the expenses related to developing your marketing and product development capabilities. Can you break that out for us a little bit? You talked, John, about the fact that you were able to cover that or fund it with some other cost reductions within SG&A, and I know that\u2019s been the messaging on this all along; but can you just help us kind of understand what was 3Q in terms of those marketing and product development expenses and where does that stand year-to-date, and would it be reasonable to assume that it maintains that level into 2018?","John Olin","Yes, absolutely. With regards to the first question, the follow-up question in Eagle Rider, those are all model year \u201917 motorcycles.","In relationship to SG&A, for example in the quarter, when we look at marketing, customer-facing marketing and product development, they were both up about 10%, and broadly when looking at those expenses from a company-wide standpoint, it\u2019s 40% to 45% of our total SG&A. So a fair investment has been made in the quarter, and over the last couple years we\u2019ve increased the amount of spending on product development as well as overall marketing. We would expect that to continue into next year. ","We are not cutting those types of things that drive our future, drive our growth strategies and current sales, so the magnitude in the quarter was about 40% of our spending, was up 10%, and we ended up coming up a little bit favorable. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on managing our SG&A expenses, given the fact that we\u2019re a smaller business.","We\u2019ve got three main principles when dealing with SG&A. Number one is to protect spending that drives short term and long term sales. Secondly is to get the entire organization focused on fewer, more impactful things; and third, David, is if it doesn\u2019t fit in the first two, evaluate whether we need to spend the money at all or delay it. Again, that\u2019s been very successful. We\u2019re reduced our spending by $50 million in the first three quarters of this year.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas. Your line is open. ","]","Adam Jonas","Thanks. A question for John Olin. Does the support agreement between the motorcycle company and HDFS effectively serve as a poison pill in a change of control event, and what should investors be aware of about this agreement within the context of a potential change of control? Thanks.","John Olin","The intention of the support agreement is strictly for our banks to pass through the very strong balance sheet that we have in the motor company through to the HDFS, to make sure that we have the credit ratings that we enjoy today that keeps our financing at very reasonable costs. It has nothing to do with change in control in any way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache. Your line is open.","Rod Lache","Hi everybody. Your Q4 production and year-end inventory is obviously based on some preliminary view on 2018, so I was hoping you might be able to give us some high level color on what your expectations are going forward; and related to that, do you have any products in the near-term pipeline that you think change the customer dynamics, maybe appeal to completely new demographics, and if the market remains weak, how should we be thinking about the SG&A opportunities that you alluded to, to correspond with the weaker market? ","John Olin","Okay, I\u2019m trying to remember the first question. 2018 expectations, we\u2019re not providing any expectations beyond this year. We feel very good about the guidance that we have out there today. We\u2019ll attack that in the fourth quarter, and Rod, as we prepare for 2018, we\u2019ll provide our guidance on our Q4 conference call, which will be at the end of January. ","I think the other question, Rod, that was asked was with regards to product--","Matthew Levatich","Yes Rod, this is Matt. We\u2019re not going to talk specifically about the future product, but as you can see from the commitment and one of our top five objectives, 50 new high impact motorcycles in the next five years, 100 in 10 years, and the 14 that we have in model year \u201918 plus a couple that came early in the spring under model year \u201917, the Street Rod and the Road King Special, and as we\u2019ve shared in our discussions in investor days how we\u2019re viewing product from a customer impact perspective, that is best understood as you look at the entire Softail line-up that runs the range of sort of nostalgic traditional products like the Deluxe, that appeal to a certain type of customer, all the way to the Fat Bob and the Fat Bob 114 that are really spiking very highly with people that were maybe more in the V-Rod realm from an adrenaline need state perspective. ","These spaces that we occupy with, if you will, the personalities of every motorcycle we develop are an important part of activating riders from every generation with performance preferences and style preferences, and that is the thinking as we approach every new product development investment and how we talk about high impact. It has to make a difference for a certain type of customer that\u2019s a growth opportunity for the company, and you\u2019re starting to see that unfold as you look at the products that we\u2019ve launched, including by the way the anniversary models. I mentioned there were two statement paint schemes - there was a paint scheme that skewed towards more traditional tastes and a paint scheme that skewed toward more modern and youth tastes, and this was the first time we\u2019ve ever done two anniversary paint schemes, again because of our focus on appealing to very specific customer need states with every product investment that we make.","So you\u2019re going to continue to see more of that over time as we leverage our product development capability to make an impact with all kinds of customers around the world, a greater variety of customers around the world (indiscernible). ","John Olin","The final--","Operator","Our next question--oh, sorry?","John Olin","I\u2019m sorry. Rod, with regards to your final question on SG&A spending next year as we look forward, again we\u2019ll provide more guidance in January, but just wanted to reiterate what Matt said in the opening. Since the industry kind of broke through what our expectations are and, quite frankly, everyone else\u2019s in terms of the decline that we saw in the second quarter, which is continuing on in the third quarter, we\u2019ve put together a three-pronged approach to address the very soft industry in the United States. That was to address the market issues through aggressive supply management, and again, we\u2019re very pleased where we\u2019re at with that.","Second, it was to aggressively manage our cost structure without jeopardizing the future, so this is largely aimed at SG&A. We will continue to invest in marketing and product development at the same or higher levels as we move forward. We will look at all other spending to make sure that we are managing it prudently in an environment of lower revenue, and again are quite pleased with the fact that we are expecting this year to end up flat as a percent of revenue. If you remember our initial guidance, it was expecting that SG&A would be up a bit, and with the shock that we took, we\u2019re aggressively managing though that. ","Then third is the unrelenting focus on our long term strategy. We will not pull back on the investment of creating 2 million riders as we move into the future and creating that next generation of riders, so that\u2019s a little bit of context around what you\u2019ll see when we talk about SG&A in 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Thanks. You\u2019ve addressed a lot of my question, but Matt, you mentioned that Rider Academy conversion improved, and I\u2019m curious what drove that and whether it\u2019s sustainable.","Matthew Levatich","Yes, thanks Craig, a number of different things. First of all, a lot of training and different thinking with respect to the dealers, and understanding that there is a rider development path and rider training plays a role in it, but getting the right people into the course and making sure not only that they have a good experience in the training class itself, but on the back side of that training class, what do we offer for them to continue their journey to becoming a confident rider. We\u2019re piloting a number of different programs in the marketplace. One in particular allows a recent Riding Academy graduate to get into a very cost effective short-term lease, if you will, on a used motorcycle on the dealer\u2019s floor, so that once they finish the class, they're able to quickly get into a motorcycle and continue their on-road riding experience. We\u2019re looking at, as well, different pilots where we pair experienced riders with newly minted Riding Academy graduates to help mentor them in their journey to riding.","So fundamentally, it\u2019s a recognition that rider training is a piece of a much more important rider development journey and what can we do, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, pull together those ingredients to help turn newly trained riders into active on-road riders. We\u2019re very pleased with that number, Craig. It does reflect a lot of great work on the part of our dealers that have Riding Academy, as well as our teams here, just under the recognition that training someone doesn\u2019t necessarily make them a rider. We have to have a long view of what it actually takes to build confident, safe, avid riders, and in my view we\u2019re just getting started. We\u2019re excited about the early results.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel. Your line is open","David Beckel","Hi, thanks for the question. I have one very quick follow-up and then another question. The first is with regard to Eagle Rider rental fill. I just want to clarify, rental units is at a few percentage points of annual U.S. shipments. Is that what you were indicating? ","John Olin","Yes, David - annual U.S. shipments, a few percent on an annual basis, that goes--retail sales into that avenue, whether it\u2019s authorized rentals or, we would expect, Eagle Rider in the future.","David Beckel","Is that expected to continue in Q4?","John Olin","You know, there are minor shipments in Q4 to the rentals program. It\u2019s on the downside of riding, and there\u2019s very few shipments. Really, (indiscernible) to the authorized rentals or Eagle Rider are much more of a first half event, and again that\u2019s why kind of the Eagle Rider initial shipments stood out in the first quarter as most of those typically ship in the first half as they get ready for the riding season.","David Beckel","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. My follow-up question, or real question, I guess, is one on international sales. It seems like it\u2019s been consistently, or maybe just weaker this quarter than expected. You had expected some weakness in the first half. But I\u2019m really trying to get at, are these international trends that we\u2019ve seen this year truly sort of idiosyncratic, like related to earthquakes or this, that and the other, or do you get any sort of sense that there has been a negative reaction caused by concerns about U.S. foreign diplomacy or things of that nature? ","Matthew Levatich","You know, we don\u2019t. This is Matt. We have a lot of measures of brand health and customer preference for the product and the brand, and there\u2019s actually a lot of really good research on this very topic generally that suggests that the connection between brand U.S.A., if you will, or political or foreign policy interpretations around the world versus American product brands and whether there is any sort of residual tarnishing crossing over, or whatever you might think, there doesn\u2019t seem to be, and there\u2019s some really very smart research on the topic that we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to because clearly the Harley brand is inextricably linked with the ideals of America, which are freedom, independence and strength. We\u2019re in all of our communication highlighting those core human values of our brand versus, if you will, the flag waving attributes because those are fundamental high impact, high value human needs everywhere we see in the world. People do make that connection with the Harley brand, and we\u2019re continuing to emphasize those core values in all of our communication.","If you\u2019re able to go on YouTube and watch the All for Freedom, Freedom for All campaign, that\u2019s a new brand identity position that we have that really emphasizes the human connection that people have with riding and with riding Harley Davidson motorcycles, and it\u2019s along the lines of what I just described.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m curious about gross margins. I think last quarter, you guys thought that they were going to be down, but not nearly by the magnitude that they were. You had already anticipated that the volume was going to be pretty sizeable impact on that, given that shipments came in where you guys anticipated, so can you talk about maybe where you saw the biggest delta from what your expectations were on the gross margin, not just what contributed the most but where it differed from what your expectations were, and then whether that has been a continued factor into your full-year guidance? Thanks.","John Olin","Sure Jaime. As we had talked last quarter, we expected gross margin to be down about 2.5 percentage points, driven by unfavorable mix as we focused on the cruisers and on lower absorption. Those both happened. ","Now, the miss was largely driven by two things. One is a less rich mix of product than we expected, not so much from a family standpoint. We shipped in exactly what we were expecting from a family standpoint, but when we look at the geographic mix, where those products went around the world, it was less rich than we first anticipated, and overall model mix was a little bit less than expected. We would expect those mix things to work out over the next couple quarters.","The other piece of it was that we had higher start-up costs than we first anticipated. The magnitude of what we did in the factories, and Matt had mentioned it\u2019s been by far the largest new product launch that we\u2019ve ever had, whether measured by the number of new parts, the number of new models, anyway you\u2019d slice it - engineering hours and so on and so forth, it was of huge magnitude. The lines didn\u2019t go up as quick as we had wanted, largely because of supply of all the changed products coming in and suppliers didn\u2019t necessarily keep up as much as we\u2019d like. That created a fair amount of overtime and additional costs in the quarter. Those are all isolated, all one-time costs. They will not repeat. We exited the quarter at planned-on line speeds, quality looks fantastic, and so it was just really the magnitude of the start-up that caused it.","So those are the two things that took us from where we were expecting at 2.5 points to a little over--well, about 4.8 points. ","Matthew Levatich","I just want to add too, to just put a little color on that, I think that the mentality within our product development and manufacturing organization is outstanding from the standpoint of making sure that we are absolutely delivering high quality motorcycles in a safe manner, and when necessary, slowing things down to be sure that that\u2019s the case. This is very much a mindset of an ounce of prevention from a quality perspective on an all-new platform is worth way more than a pound of cure, and that\u2019s what we saw in the quarter, was a lot of good discipline to make sure that we are producing quality products and doing it in a safe way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman. Your line is open.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to focus on what strikes me as maybe the best news in the quarter, and that\u2019s that I think you made the point in the prepared remarks that used prices were a little bit better at retail and not just auction. First, when do you think that translates into better demand for new? What role, if any, do you think that the bigger than normal price increase that you had on the model year \u201818s might play if we\u2019re thinking about the delta between the new bikes and then the used bikes? Then--","John Olin","James?","Amy Giuffre","Emily, did we lose James? ","Operator","We have--yes, he was supposed to ask only one question, so he can queue up to ask the other part of his question.","Amy Giuffre","All right. John, why don\u2019t you go ahead and answer, and James, just email me and let me know what your follow-up was, we\u2019ll get back to you. Sorry about that.","John Olin","So James, absolutely. When we look at the quarter, there was some very good things - new product, market share gains, but you cannot overlook the importance of the used bike prices. We started talking about this, or first saw the signs of goodness in the first quarter, and we saw the auction or the wholesale markets prices rise on a year-over-year basis. That held in the second quarter, and in the second quarter we also saw the pricing services start to pick up the activity at auction, and those pricing services published higher prices. At that time in the second quarter, the broader market still was down on a year-over-year basis, and that was 12 quarters of being down. ","This quarter, we\u2019re still very firm at auction. The pricing services are still posting much higher prices, in some cases 15% higher on some of our touring product, and then we\u2019ve seen that move into the broader market and we\u2019ve seen used bike prices up on a year-over-year basis. So we couldn\u2019t be more pleased, and yes, that starts to close that gap a little bit.","Now at the same time, we\u2019ve raised prices in the third quarter, but when we look at that, it was all certainly content driven, and the amount of innovation and content that we brought to the products we believe will not weaken the sales, because it does come with a lot of content. But we\u2019re very pleased to see used bike prices moving in the right direction, and we\u2019ll continue to keep an eye on it. As that price rises, more people will make the choice to buy new versus used, because with the new they get all the innovation, the new engine, new chassis. They get a bike with no miles and they get a warranty, a two-year warranty which is worth a lot. ","Again, each time we move closer, we would expect that balance between new and used sales to become more in line with one another, and what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple years is used growing much faster than new, and would expect to see that temper and even out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about the industry in more detail, since that seems to be having the greatest impact on your results? Is there maybe either some geographies that are negative, oil and gas markets, I know you mentioned hurricanes, and then what\u2019s been the change in the competitive landscape in the third quarter? Anything that you\u2019ve seen this quarter that\u2019s different than the last few quarters, whether it\u2019s domestic, Indian, or it\u2019s some of your international or Japanese competitors? ","John Olin","Okay Greg. You know, the industry has certainly been the issue. In terms of Harley Davidson, we\u2019re competing well, market share looks fine, products are fantastic. It has been an issue of the industry. The industry has been challenged for eight quarters and down quite significantly for six.","When we look at slicing and dicing it, every quarter is a little bit different, but that core rate has been running down between 6% and 7%. We believe a big factor of that is the disparity between new and used motorcycle pricing. That has been the constant over this period of time and has been building up for numerous quarters - again, it just switched after 12 quarters, so we believe that\u2019s the biggest piece.","But you get into the third quarter and the southeast was down quite significantly behind the hurricanes. We talked about that, about 2 percentage points of growth, but also out west the extreme heat that they were experiencing in the third quarter, the west was lower. But you know, those go back and forth, and we\u2019re not seeing any patterns of any of our southern regions that we track that are down more than the average over time, so it is really more driven, we believe, by the soft used bike pricing, and again starting to see a little bit of improvement from that respect. ","In terms of the competitive landscape, no big changes in the competitive set. ","Matthew Levatich","Yes, I\u2019ll just jump in here. I think that in a large way, the product quality out in the marketplace from all the competition, and Harley included, has never been better, and that\u2019s good for the industry. We aim to compete on our merits for share with our product and our channel and our marketing, whatever the competition might do. I do think that the sort of weaker dollar settling in at a weaker level should help with the discounting pressure from the non-U.S. manufacturers, so that\u2019s a good sign, but we\u2019re bringing everything we have to bear on this marketplace to not only grow ridership but to compete for share and to do it profitably, and I think we\u2019re a formidable competitor.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Woolf. Your line is open.","Seth Woolf","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of questions on market share this morning. I just wanted to take a step back. If we go to the beginning of the year, we were talking about the long-term plan, and you had updated behind the high impact models slight growth in the U.S., stronger growth in international markets. Now that we\u2019re coming towards the end of the year, we\u2019ve seen the U.S. deteriorate beyond what you expected at that point, even talked about it quite a bit, and then the international markets, one thing here, one thing there, but it\u2019s been six straight quarters of slowing growth.","So just hoping you could kind of address whether or not there\u2019s any changes to the long-term outlook, you still feel good about that, and then as we get into next year, you said inventory will be tight in the U.S. Does that mean maybe we\u2019ll step away from these boom and bust quarters where you\u2019re shipping a lot, you pull back, shipping a lot? Thank you.","John Olin","Thanks Seth. Just a correction - we expected the U.S. to be down slightly, offset by international at the onset of the year. We expected the industry to be down, but it was down significantly more than we expected, and that\u2019s really driving everything that you\u2019re seeing with regards to retail sales. As you talk about boom and bust, as we entered into the year, we were looking to take a lot of inventory out, and we did in the first quarter. The second quarter, we would have taken out more had it not been for the industry being down, again lapping itself in the fifth quarter, down that additional 7--I think it was 7.3% last period.","So yes, with the tighter inventory going forward, we would expect the predictability to be a little bit better and that we would not have to make as big of adjustments. In the United States, the industry continues to be down that core run rate, and we do expect that to dissipate. Right now, it\u2019s very difficult to call. It\u2019s much easier to forecast when you look at new and used combined, but given the divergence that we have in growth rates between new and used, it\u2019s become very difficult to forecast. ","We understand the pain that that\u2019s causing for our shareholders and others, but I don\u2019t know anyone that has called the industry right at this point. It\u2019s an industry that has grown 28 out of 33 years, and there\u2019s only been two periods in three decades where it\u2019s been down - one was in the recession in 2009 and \u201910, and then over the last two years here, so we\u2019re doing our best to forecast it.","I think what you can count on is the fact that we continue to address the issues that we\u2019re facing from a principled standpoint, making sure that we do not discount, we do not cheapen the brand, and we take the hard actions in terms of managing the inventory in the system. It\u2019s been difficult and it\u2019s been painful, but again we\u2019re going to continue to manage on the business for the long term. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in the future and growth, and we do think that there is a very vibrant growth prospect for this company, in particular in the international markets. ","Similarly, the international markets have been up for Harley Davidson for an extended period of time, and we are in a trough with our international markets. It was first driven by emerging markets that ran into some troubles, spurred on by India and demonetization and the GST, but also in China. We\u2019re starting to work out way out of that, and we saw emerging markets, with the exception of Mexico, gain momentum and turn positive, and established markets with the exception of a couple have been performing well. In Europe, we feel very good - we\u2019re up on retail sales in core Europe. ","So overall, we feel good, but it has been a tough four or five quarters in international markets. We expect international to grow as we go forward. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino","Great, thank you. Just a question on HDFS - better in the quarter on lower provision for retail loan losses. Do you feel as if you\u2019ve kind of hit a plateau with where you are from your 30-day delinquencies and your loss experience, or do you think that continues to drive higher?","John Olin","Well, we are very pleased just more broadly, and thanks for the question, David, HDFS is having a very good year and providing a lot of opportunities to sell motorcycles, incremental motorcycles for us. What you\u2019re seeing in the quarter is just a slapping--a bigger provision on a year-over-year basis. As you saw, the delinquencies are up still a bit, 11 basis points, and losses are up 14 basis points, so they continue to rise. They\u2019re in line with what the industry is seeing and certainly in line with our expectations, and much improved from last year where we saw delinquencies up 45 basis points and credit losses up about 40 basis points, so that\u2019s the financial impact of lapping--or that slowing delinquency and credit loss rate. ","We\u2019re not going to project what we think it will do going forward, but just to say that we\u2019re very pleased to see that it is mitigating. The team at HDFS is doing a fantastic job. As we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve tightened some of the substandard underwriting that we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019re very pleased with where we\u2019re at and the momentum and the direction that we have.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Joe Spak. Your line is open.","Joe Spak","Thanks, just some quick follow-ups. One, how much of the lower SG&A is actual cuts and savings versus just delayed spending, and second, can you talk about the mix of bikes on the rentals? Are those fully contented, like they would be a normal retail sale?","John Olin","Joe, I am not prepared to talk about, because I don\u2019t know the answer right off the top of my head, on SG&A versus being cut or delayed. The vast majority of it would be money that we\u2019re not going to spend given the environment that we have and don\u2019t expect it to come back, but in terms of an overall percentage of the $50 million that we\u2019re favorable, I just don\u2019t have that answer. We\u2019re going to continue to manage the company in line with what our revenue gives us, and we\u2019ll continue to respond against those three--that core three-pronged approach that we have. ","Secondly, the mix on Eagle Rider bikes skews heavily toward touring bikes, and so they\u2019re mainly the core OE touring bikes. As people rent, they typically--a lot of people are coming in from tours internationally or riding different parts of the country and rent touring bikes. The next most popular models would be cruisers, but they\u2019d be well behind touring, and there\u2019s very few rentals in the small cruisers, when you\u2019re talking about sportsters and street motorcycles. ","Operator","There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over the presenters for closing remarks.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Emily, and thanks everyone.

Those risks include among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, our President and CEO, Matt Levatich and CFO, John Olin will be hosting. So, Matt, let's get started.","Matthew S. Levatich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Amy, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We talk in depth about our Q2 results and what we see going forward. You've all read the news release we issued this morning. John and I will bring context and perspective to those results and highlight some of the factors that are at place, so you can get the best read on our outlook for Q3, the full year and beyond.","Before John goes into the detailed financials, I'd like to comment on two themes: market performance and then company performance. From a market perspective, we're very pleased with our share performance in the U.S. where we gained two points of share in the heavyweight segment for the quarter on top of our already strong share position. As the U.S. remains highly competitive, this gain is an important validation that our initial investments to drive demand are working.","Since the beginning of the year, we made investments designed to impact customer choice and support our long-term strategy of growing our reach and impact with customers and strong returns to investors. Our demand-driving investments are focused in four areas: increasing product and brand awareness; growing new ridership in the United States; increasing and enhancing brand access; and accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. Our teams across the globe launched several initiatives behind these investments with precision and effectiveness, delivering solid results in our international markets and driving the market share gains in the United States.","Looking internationally, our retail sales were up 4.3%, driven by continued growth in Asia, Canada and Mexico, and our best ever quarter for Harley-Davidson in our EMEA region. Our investments to increase demo rides in EMEA for example, was a major contributor to our growth in the region in Q2, nothing seals a deal better for a new customer than experiencing one of our great bikes firsthand.","In Asia, where we maintained our number one market share in Australia, India and Japan, we focused our investments on demo rides and growing ridership. And in the U.S., the Live Your Legend campaign and other demand-driving investments built significant relevance and helped drive a 30% increase in demo rides so far this year and a 40% increase in the number of students trained through the Harley-Davidson Riding Academy.","There are also some real positives in the nature of retail sales and market share gains that further reinforce the strength of our work, both near- and long-term. Notably, we are very pleased to have growth year-to-date in the all important young adult segment in the United States. The young adult segment is not only important for the long-term, it's the most competitive market segment in the U.S. All of these initiatives combined represent an important long-term play as we seek to grow this sport in the U.S. and bring new customers into the brand in all of our markets.","I'm encouraged that the actions that we've taken so far this year have enabled us to make progress on our long-term growth strategy. However worldwide sales for the quarter were down due to significant declines in the U.S. industry which was far weaker than expected. We expected the industry to be down in the first half of the year, as we lapped industry growth in 2015 that was stimulated by the shift in currency and the resulting competitive discounting, and as we also expected by continued weakness in the oil-dependent areas.","We did not however expect the industry as a whole would be as soft as it is. While our share gains helped to blunt the full impact of this weak market, lackluster industry sales have had a significant impact on our results and our forward expectations. As a result, we're taking the prudent step to lower expected 2016 shipments. This is largely due to what we believe will be continued pressure on industry growth in the U.S. coupled with caution as we consider the potential impact of the macro economic uncertainty on sales globally.","We remain steadfast in our commitment to keep supply in line with demand to protect the premium nature of the brand, and we believe the steps we're taking will ensure dealer inventory is in line by year-end to support the expected sales environment.","All in, we now plan to ship fewer motorcycles for the full year, and are revising our shipment guidance from 1% to 3% growth to approximately down 1% to up 1% from 2015. Our production plans and shipment expectations are intended to drive a flat inventory at year-end even with our expanded model range. These actions will have a drag on earnings for the full year, so we're revising our full year expected operating margin down one percentage point to 15% to 16%. Without question, we must assure inventory balance for our long-term competitiveness and profitability for both the company and our incredible dealers.","Now, shifting from market to company performance, you'll see that gross margin declined in the quarter. There are a number of factors here that both John and I will address. As we've discussed in prior calls, we expected higher manufacturing costs due to the significant investments we're making to advance our flexible manufacturing strategy. These investments are complex and require discipline, planning, and execution, including numerous down days, inventory bridges and careful ramp plans. The net impact can be seen in changes to gross margin, shipments and inventory patterns in the second quarter, and the impact will continue in Q3 as we ramp back to full production.","The investments are part of the manufacturing flexibility strategy that will enhance cost-effective flexibility now at our Kansas City plant. Another factor in gross margin performance in Q2 is the impact of volume and mix adjustments we made to capture the demand lift from the Cruiser success we experienced in the quarter, while also adjusting downward the total volume in the softer than expected U.S. industry. The U.S. industry turned swiftly in the second quarter. We responded with discipline and commitment in an effort to keep supply in line with demand, and these actions also impacted our gross margin in the quarter. While difficult, these actions were necessary to set us up for success for our model year launch and also for 2017 and beyond.","And speaking of new products, in our new model launch, I'm incredibly excited about our lineup, which we will unveil to our global dealer network at the end of August. We'll add to the stable of products driving our current success and we've got some incredible products in the pipeline for 2018, our 115th anniversary and beyond.","Before I turn it over to John, I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone associated with this great company; employees, dealers, suppliers and our passionate riders. I'm proud of our team and all the work that's been done at Harley-Davidson. We're in challenging times. Political, economic and cultural forces are all working against confidence and security for people everywhere in the world. Everyone in our company is aware and attuned to what we need to do. We have a 113-year history of challenges we've stood up to and faced down. The power of personal freedom for our riders is stronger than ever, and we all aim to deliver for them.","We understand the intense need to manage through these challenges effectively and deliver results. We're stewards of this incredible brand and of your investment, and we do not take that responsibility lightly. Without question, driving demand, growing the business and delivering strong returns are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson. And we're focused every day on delivering for our riders, near-term and long-term in order to do so.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to John. Thank you.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our second quarter financial results found in our press release and supportings, starting on slide nine.","During the quarter, revenue was $1.86 billion, net income was $280.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.55. Operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down 15.2% from last year's second quarter. Segment revenue was up 1.2% in the quarter, behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycle shipments. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased versus prior year as a result of unfavorable product mix and currency exchange, in addition to higher year-over-year manufacturing costs. SG&A was also up in the quarter as we increased our demand-driving and product development investments. Operating income as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 19.3%.","At HDFS, operating income was up 9.4% year-over-year in part driven by a gain related to a full securitization. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interest expense resulting from our 2015 recapitalization and the lower effective tax rate. Despite the challenging conditions we continue to face, we remain focused on driving demand and delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long-term.","On slide 10, you'll see worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q2 were down 1.9% versus prior year. International retail sales were up year-over-year, while the U.S. retail sales were lower than expected on surprisingly weak industry results. Despite the ongoing challenging macroeconomic and motorcycle industry conditions, we were encouraged with our share gains in the second quarter.","Our ability to grow internationally and partially offset the industry headwinds in the United States reinforces our intensified focus on driving demand and enhancing our strong brand. Our increased investments in driving demand and product development drove positive market share results in the U.S. and in Europe during the first half of this year. In addition, the positive response to our new 2016 motorcycle models continued during the second quarter.","As Matt noted, we continued to be committed and steadfast in our resolve to manage supply in line with demand. Given the poor U.S. industry retail sales in Q2 and softness expected into the second half of 2016, we are taking steps to adjust retail inventory in the U.S. and now expect year-end retail inventory in the U.S. to be in line with prior year, versus our previous expectation to grow year-end retail inventory. Considering our desire to reduce year-end U.S. retail inventory in the face of soft U.S. industry sales and the uncertainty resulting from global macroeconomic challenges, we have lowered our full year shipment expectations.","Let's take a closer look at the U.S. on slide 11. Q2 retail sales in the U.S. were down 5.2% versus prior year, behind weak U.S. industry sales. The impact of the weak U.S. industry on our sales was partially offset by strong gains in market share. The U.S. industry was down 8.6% during the quarter. While we expected the industry to be down in the first half of 2016, we did not expect the extent to which the second quarter declined, especially considering the high level of competitive discounting that continued during the quarter. We believe the industry was down due to the following two factors: lapping strong year-ago industry growth driven by the onset of aggressive competitive discounting in the year-ago period and weak sales in oil-dependent areas.","While the industry lagged our expectations, we are encouraged with our Q2 market share of 49.5% in the U.S., which was up a strong 2.0 percentage points. We believe our second quarter market share gains were driven by our demand-driving investments focused on growing product awareness and growing ridership in the U.S. and a strong reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models. While our competitors continued to engage in levels of discounting similar to the first quarter and at a more aggressive levels than in last year's second quarter, we were very pleased that we were able to increase market share in the U.S. by brand enhancing actions.","U.S. retail inventory was up at the end of the second quarter driven by three factors. First, we offered five incremental models versus the prior year. Second, inventory was up as we shipped all model year 2016 motorcycles in advance of the Q3 ERP implementation. And also as a result of lower than expected Q2 retail sales.","On slide 12, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up in Q2. All regions were up except Latin America, which was impacted by weakness in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, international markets were up 5.6%. During the quarter, EMEA retail sales were up 8.2% behind a great reception to our new 2016 motorcycle models and increased demand-driving investments. This quarter, strong retail sales also benefited from lapping lower prior year retail sales. Market share in EMEA was up 0.3% on a year-to-date basis. Asia-Pacific retail sales growth slowed as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales comps of up nearly 17% and as we temporarily exited the market in Indonesia earlier this year in order to establish a new dealer network and improved customer experience.","Latin America retail sales trends improved significantly from last quarter behind continued strong growth in Mexico. Weakness in Brazil drove overall sales declines in the region as sales continued to be impacted by a challenging economy and consumer uncertainty. In response to the nearly 50% devaluation of the Brazilian real last year, we raised model year 2016 prices over 20% to improve profitability per motorcycle. We continue to expect retail sales to be down for the year.","Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 2.0% in the second quarter. We believe the market continued to respond well to the change to a direct distribution model and pricing adjustments that were made at the model year. As part of our strategic focus on increasing brand access, we plan to continue to expand our international distribution. We added six new international dealerships in the second quarter.","On slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were slightly above our guidance as we shipped ahead of the Q3 ERP implementation. As a result, U.S. shipments in retail inventory increased during the quarter and company inventory fell below prior year levels. Our production plants were idled earlier this month and overall production was down about 30% in July as we successfully implemented our ERP system in Kansas City. We began model year 2017 production on schedule. Second quarter shipment mix reflected strong demand for our new 2016 Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles.","On slide 14, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment was up in the second quarter, behind a 3.5% increase in motorcycle shipments. Revenue in the quarter was unfavorably impacted by the significant shift in mix to our Cruiser and Sportster motorcycles and slightly unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. As a result, average motorcycle revenue per unit was down for the quarter.","On slide 15, you'll see gross margin as a percent of revenue in the quarter was down 2.8 percentage points versus last year. While we expected Q2 gross margin to be unfavorable driven by mix, currency and manufacturing, the impacts from mix and manufacturing were more unfavorable than we anticipated. During the quarter, customer demand for our Cruisers and Sportsters exceeded our expectations, which led to higher than expected mix unfavorability of $17.6 million. As we expected, foreign currency exchange was negative as we lapped significant hedge gains in last year's second quarter, and as we have lower revenues behind a slightly stronger U.S. dollar.","Manufacturing expenses were higher than expected, unfavorable $36.1 million during the second quarter. We did expect significant unfavorable variances largely driven by startup costs related to the implementation of our ERP system in Kansas City, and costs associated with significant plant retooling. However, as Matt explained, plant efficiencies were lower than expected due to lower production given soft sales in Q2 and other plant disruptions. It is important to note the increase in manufacturing costs that we've experienced in the first half of this year, are largely temporary in nature, and we would not expect the majority of these costs to reoccur in 2017. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q3 manufacturing expense to be unfavorable behind lower absorption and higher year-over-year startup costs. Conversely, we expect manufacturing favorability in Q4.","On slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 19.3%, down compared to last year's second quarter. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A resulting from both our increased investments in driving demand and product development and from costs associated with managing our Canadian operations, which we acquired in August of 2015. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be near year-ago levels. We remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible, and more profitable.","Moving on to HDFS on slide 16 (sic) [slide 17]. During the quarter, HDFS's operating profit increased $7.7 million or 9.4% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting second quarter results were: first, net interest income was up over prior year by $5.0 million, this increase was driven by higher receivables, partially offset by higher borrowing costs and lower yields due in part to the 2015 low interest rate promotional activity; second, the provision for retail motorcycle loan losses increased over prior year by $8.2 million driven by higher retail credit losses, and an associated increase in the allowance. It is important to note that second quarter provision increase was significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016.","Finally you will see on the slide a gain on full securitization. This represents a full securitization in which we sold retail finance receivables with a principal balance of approximately $302 million along with all the residual financial interest in those receivables. Because we have no ownership interest in the receivables, the transaction was recorded as a sale which in this case resulted in a gain of $9.3 million.","HDFS's operational results are summarized on slide 18. For the quarter, originations were down 3.9% compared to last year but HDFS's share of U.S. new retail motorcycle sales increased to 63.4%. Year-to-date loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant industry leader to subprime customers, these originations continue to represent a significant number of retail sales to the company, at very attractive returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.02 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. HDFS also paid a $43 million dividend to H-D Inc. during the quarter, which I will talk more about in a moment.","On slide 19, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables that remained on our balance sheet was 3.16% or 45 basis points higher than Q2 2015.14 basis points of the increase represents a change in the mix of the portfolio after the securitization of $302 million of prime receivables. The delinquency rate on a managed basis, including those loans sold in the full securitization was still 31 basis points higher than the prior year due in part to deterioration in oil-dependent areas. Despite the increase, delinquencies remain near historically low levels.","Annualized retail credit losses for receivables that remain on our balance sheet was 1.50% or 42 basis points higher than Q2 2015. On a managed basis, the credit loss rate was 1.49%. The increase was a result of higher losses on loans in oil-dependent areas, normalizing loan performance and lower used bike values at auction. During the quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and continued strong profitability to the company.","Remaining Harley-Davidson Inc., financial results are summarized on slide 20. A few things to note, operating cash was down from last year, driven by net income, higher working capital and higher net wholesale lending. And year-to-date tax rate was 32.7% which was lower than last year's tax rate behind the successful closure of various tax audits allowing us to reduce our tax reserves. The company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and\/or committed credit facilities. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We expect to return all excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and continued share repurchases.","On slide 21, you will see we did both during the second quarter. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we completed a full securitization because we sold all ownership interest in the receivables, the receivables and any corresponding debt are not recorded on HDFS's balance sheet. Consequently, this allowed HDFS to pay a dividend to H-D Inc. of $43 million without impacting HDFS's debt-to-equity ratio. We used the dividend to repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase authorizations.","While we believe the EPS impact was neutral, the shareholder repurchase associated with the full securitization increased our shareholder's ownership in the company at a time when our stock is trading at historically low PE. This was the first time HDFS or we believe any other manufacturer has utilized this market. Actions such as this demonstrate our commitment to explore avenues to improve funding costs, diversified funding sources and return excess cash to our shareholders. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to return excess cash to our shareholders, without damaging the long-term value of the company or the brand.","On slide 22, you'll see our overall expectations for 2016. We now expect to ship 264,000 motorcycles to 269,000 motorcycles, which is approximately down 1% to up 1% over last year. We expect third quarter shipments to be approximately flat to down 9% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect operating margin for the Motorcycles segment to be approximately 15% to 16%. We are lowering our expectations by approximately one percentage point due to the loss absorption on lower production, unfavorable mix, and higher manufacturing expense. Finally, we now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 33%. Our 2016 directional expectations for gross margin, SG&A, HDFS and capital expenditures are unchanged and noted on the slide.","While the weak U.S. industry and continued intense competition drove less than expected retail sales during the quarter, we are encouraged by the positive market share results from our demand-driving investments and new models. We are also pleased to see international retail sales growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to make the necessary decisions to support a prudent retail inventory position and to protect our strong brand and profitability into the future.","We are maintaining our intense focus on maximizing shareholder value by returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We will continue to navigate through the challenging environment and are making investments to drive demand and deliver strong margins and strong returns over the long-term.","Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig, your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, with respect to industry demand, what do you think accounts for the significant weakness in new bike sales, specifically what role did either credit conditions or a surplus in the supply of used bikes account for some of that weakness in new demand? Thanks.","Matthew S. Levatich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Craig. I actually think that there's a lot going on, so it's really difficult to lay it off on any specific thing. Certainly, the uncertainty in the political environment, the credit conditions as you mentioned, the oil-dependent regions that we discussed, we have sort of numbers associated with that in particular. Also the significant growth last year, as I mentioned and the corresponding comp for this year, we knew that that was going to create pressure. The forecast for the industry growth were kind of in that 2% range and clearly it's not materializing that way.","And so, we're looking at it very carefully, investing in new products and awareness and rider training and focusing on our efforts on what we can do to not only grow share, but grow our sales and primarily doing that through growing the sport. So, there is a lot of real positive things in that realm. I mentioned some of them in my opening remarks, but clearly this is a disappointment and we're regrouping as a result of it, and doubling down on what we know is working and to drive the industry.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon, your line is open.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. John, I had a question on the SG&A. I know you're still expecting it to be flattish year-over-year, but it was up nicely in the first half of the year. So where are you going to see the opportunities to have those dollars decline in the back half? And then when you look out in future years, is there more room to kind of keep that SG&A flattish in future years or how are you guys thinking about that?","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Sharon. So as you pointed out, when we look at SG&A over the first half, it is up about 6%, and I'm looking at our full year guidance to be flat to up slightly. Obviously the back half is going to be down. We would expect the third quarter to still be up on a year-over-year basis as we continue to spend that incremental investment in driving demand, and then we would expect the fourth quarter to be down quite a bit in terms of SG&A. And remember, Sharon, that in the fourth quarter of last year, there was a restructuring charge in that number of about $23 million in SG&A. And so with that, as long as the other reductions that we've made in the core infrastructure of the company to fund the incremental demand-driving investments, we would expect the overall back half of the year to be down in SG&A.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In terms of going forward.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","And then comment. Yeah. Thank you.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sorry. In terms of going forward, we are focused on managing SG&A, but continuing to invest in the future, whether that be in new products or certainly the marketing of those.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia, your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess this question is for you both, Matt and John. Do you think that you're positioned appropriately for the declining industry that seemed to surprise you in the quarter? I'm just wondering if your plans for the second half and also for next year are appropriate for the current environment. I mean understand the reasons behind the inventory build that you talked about, positioning for the new models, getting ahead of Kansas City ERP. But, just given the environment, given the surprises that continue to come and given the competition, I'm just wondering how much you've stress tested your growth plans for the second half and for next year.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Felicia. Let me break the question up into two answers. First, inventory as we exit the first half. Retail inventory was up 20, or I'm sorry 8,300 units, largely driven by five incremental models. On average, our dealers have about 2.5 of each of those models in their dealerships. And that adds up actually to over 8,000 units. But, we also wanted to ship in ahead of the ERP implementation. So, when we look at second quarter, and you also, you look at the retail side, which is up 8,300 units, our company-owned inventory is down quite a bit. And, when you net those two, we're basically up in the second quarter one-third of July's production. And, that's what we expect to lose.","So, to answer your question, as we exit the first half, we're right in line with what we expected in terms of inventory on a year-on-year basis, again, to compensate for the lost production in July. When we extend that forward, we were expecting inventories in the U.S. to grow behind additional models. And, given that environment that you've mentioned and certainly that we experienced in the second quarter, we are more cautious and want to be more prudent from an inventory perspective and with that we do not expect inventories to grow in the United States at year-end. And yes, we absolutely feel that is the appropriate level of inventory given soft retail sales that we're seeing in the first half of this year.","Matthew S. Levatich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a great answer, John. I'll just add my perspective on it. My short answer is yes. I think we've looked very clear eyed at the condition in the industry year-to-date, projected that forward and what you see in behind John's comments, finishing flat with additional models is actually leaning out our inventory. And you can read from that, that we expect and we believe is embedded in our numbers the industry to continue to be soft for the balance of the year, and probably into next year as well. And so we feel we're adequately provisioning and preparing for that, but, and I guess, also with a healthy dose of realism given what we saw that was quite surprising here in the second quarter. So, we feel like we're in very good shape on both sales and inventory for the balance of the year as well as heading into next year in the level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Tim, your line is open.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. John, on HDFS with the prime sale, how do you see any of those potential transactions going forward? And then does this leave you with more loans that you still have on the balance sheet or exposure to a higher mix of prime? And then one other thing related to Brexit, what are you seeing in the UK and Europe retail trends post the Brexit vote. Any impact whatsoever? Thank you.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Jim. When we look at the securitization that we recently did about a month ago, there were two changes in that securitization from normal securitizations that we execute. (35:40) pointed out is that they were made up of a 100% of prime receivables and the second one is we sold the residual interest that allowed us to classify it off balance sheet.","Your question centers around the prime aspect of it, so historically we've sold securitizations that resemble our originations about 80% prime and 20% subprime. I've heard all kinds of speculation as to why we did a 100% prime, so let me clear that up, some of that speculation has been is we can't sell subprime into the market, and that is absolute untruth nonsense.","So for over a decade, we've been selling a mix of prime and subprime into a very robust demand in the marketplace and that have not changed at all. What has changed over the last couple securitization is that our spreads have widened on the securitization to our benchmark. Our benchmark is prime auto, and there is no one else that does a mixture of securitizations like we do, so we benchmark the prime auto. What we have noticed over the last couple securitizations is the spreads widening out a little bit. And so the best way to tether them back was to get a comparable securitization to our benchmark. And with that we saw extreme tightening of those margins or of those spreads to prime auto. So, as we look forward, whether we decide to do all prime or subprime and prime, the kind of the tethering of the investment community to that spread against prime has been very important to us, and will pay dividends as we move into the future. So that's why we move forward with the prime securitization.","Your second question is with regards to Brexit. And you know at this point, there is not enough information or not enough time has gone by to understand the impact of Brexit. I think, what we are very certain of is that Brexit does not provide any benefit to retail sales or consumer confidence in Europe. And I think, this is what Matt talked about a little is, I'd put it into a broader bucket instead of just Brexit as overall consumer confidence driven by geopolitical concerns or macroeconomic concerns. But we're very excited about the momentum that we have in our European business, as you can see for the quarter, it was up quite significantly. We'll keep a close eye on Brexit, but we're going to focus on what we can control and continue to drive a great customer experience for our customers around the world.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Greg, your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Great. Thank you. Two questions, first on follow-up to kind of Tim's question, just Europe, I mean, the 8% growth this quarter, what was the key driver for that? And how sustainable can it be, because it's been \u2013 it was strong last quarter as well pretty similar? And then second, there was some speculation that I think you were in discussions or maybe you received an offer from private equity firm few weeks back. Just wondering was that, is that the case or are you in a \u2013 were you in any serious conversations or are you at this point?","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","All right. First question Greg is with regards to Europe, we \u2013 again, we couldn't be more pleased \u2013 I think, Matt mentioned it in his upfront remarks is the focus of our European team on getting people on our motorcycles, the demos that they're doing has driven a tremendous amount of volume in that market.","Also, our product offering, you got to remember that Europe has got a bigger mix of Cruisers, to Touring than we have in the United States. The product is just as well received in Europe, as it is here in the United States, that's certainly helping to drive some of the performance, and we expect the team there to continue to focus on getting people exposed to our motorcycles and we couldn't again be more pleased with where we're at in growing market share. Again, and just as a competitive market as the United States, not driven by price (39:58) Europe by tremendous addition of the lower displacement motorcycles. And again, we're doing well and gaining share in a robustly growing market in Europe.","The second comment is with regards to market rumors, surrounding our stock and a potential private equity investor, we don't comment on any rumors \u2013 any stock market rumors. That would consume our entire life if we did that.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush. James, your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. A clarification and then a question from me. I guess, first, obviously retail was materially worse than what you anticipated and yet the shipments were actually a little bit higher than the high-end of your guidance. I guess what was different there than how you anticipated heading into the quarter? And then maybe a little bit of a follow-up to Robin's question. We're trending towards the lower-end of that down 1% to up 1% in terms of retail year-to-date. I guess, what gives you confidence that the industry and\/or your numbers will get any better, and I guess what happens if the industry gets worse given that the most recent data point is a step down from what we saw in the first quarter? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Thanks, James. When you look at the second quarter, we did ship a little bit over the high end of guidance and at the same time during the quarter, we were cutting production quite dramatically and our retail sales were down. So, you're saying is, can you help me out \u2013 help me understand this. So, basically as we got toward the end of the quarter, we had all the product made, and that was either in retail or in our company-owned inventory, and typically we have a bit of company-owned inventory in the United States, that facilitates the flow and the orderly shipment of motorcycles.","We made the decision to ship it all out prior to the period. The reason we did that is in the very outside chance that we had any issues with ERP system. If they're in our system, we may have trouble getting them shipped. So it was just a simple act of de-risking of the overall ERP implementation. I couldn't be more pleased to say that the team did a fantastic job, everything came up as expected, the ramp plans are on plan, and everything is moving forward. But James, it was simply that is, we could take a little bit more risk out of it.","Now having said that, overall inventories as I mentioned, I think, to Felicia, overall inventories didn't change. But we had company-owned inventories lower on a year-over-year basis and we put a little bit more into the field. So, overall inventories are where we would've expected them despite the lower than expected sales based on our production reductions and lower company-owned inventory.","The second question that you asked is with regards to our revised guidance, which is down 1% to up 1%. We go through a robust process, looking at all factors and everything that we know in the marketplace, which is centered around new dealerships coming up in the international markets. We'll have more dealers in the back half \u2013 new dealers in the back half than front half. We look at the performance of outreach in the United States, that's performing extremely well. We look at the investments that we made and the demand driving activities, what we expect to come out of those, and certainly and most importantly, we look at the new models that we're going to be launching here in three weeks to four weeks, and we couldn't be more excited about that. You take all those together, James. We're very confident that we are going to ship from 264,000 motorcycles to 269,000 motorcycles for 2016.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I'll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Jaime, your line is open.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I am curious with regards to inventory and what's in the channel now in light of the slower growth environment. Can you guys talk about your thoughts on the ability to take prices in the next model year coming online, and then if you would comment on where you might be seeing the most share gains. I know \u2013 I think the share losses last year were from international competitors, but it sounds like there's still a decent amount of discounting going on, so if you have any color on that, that would be really helpful. Thanks.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. With regards to inventory, retail sales, we've talked a little bit about that. We feel that we're at the right spot given our forward look at retail sales, given where we expect inventories to be. And if we haven't shown our resolve to manage this company for the long-term value of our shareholders and the actions that we've taken to keep the marketplace, aggressively managed supply in line with demand or to hold to \u2013 we're not going to discount our way out of this soft spot that we're expecting that people aren't looking. We've got tremendous resolve and we will manage the inventory at appropriate levels.","And now with regards to pricing, I'm not going to speak a lot about that because in three weeks you'll see the new models, and you'll see the pricing and you can answer that question for yourself, Jamie. But again, we feel very comfortable where we're at with regards to the market, and we'll continue to manage it very tightly.","I'm glad you asked about share gains in the United States. I couldn't be more thrilled to answer this question. A year ago, we sat here, Matt and I, Matt's first conference call, and we said that we had an issue, given the shift in world currencies and the incredible competitiveness that came out of it, in particular in discounting, and we said that we were not going to discount our way out it, we weren't going to drain the industry of profits and chase this thing. And it was going to take us some time, but we were going to spend more time understanding what we need to do, and how we can compete world of expanded price gaps without cheapening our brand, and now dial forward a couple quarters, we are there, and we delivered 2 two points of market share gains.","So, let me talk a second about those, the gains were very strong and wide. Number one, they came in all of our segments, our Touring segment, our Cruisers and our Street\/Sportster segment size of motorcycle. They came in the seven sales regions that we have in the United States, we gained share in each and every one of them. Our gains were over double the nearest competitor.","And when you look broadly at those share gains, what we saw is the biggest loser were in aggregate Japanese competitors. We also saw while we had mentioned in the preamble that overall discounting was higher on a year-over-year basis, we did see the Japanese discounting be down a little bit versus year ago, and that seems to be reflecting in their market share. With that we saw a rotation in the brand discounting from the Japanese to the American brands in the second quarter, and we're seeing some of the share gains in there. Overall, Europeans' market share was down a little bit, but we had some big winners and big losers in that segment. Hopefully that helps, Jaime.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David, your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. I realize there's a limit on what you want to say about model year 2017 just given we're so close to the rollout. But I guess what I wanted to ask you was, what did you learn from the model year 2016 product and the way it was received in a more competitive environment that's guided you on your plans for 2017?","Matthew S. Levatich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, David, I appreciate the question. Actually, we're incredibly pleased with the model year 2016 products and how they drove the market globally. This is a lot of the S models that we launched a year ago basically, as well as the products we introduced during the model year. And clearly, there are a lot of constraints in this competitive environment that we're in, but our product drives customer passion, customer loyalty and sales and market share. We saw that with the shift in sales to large cruisers, which helped us gain share. Those large cruisers are a little lower margin than our touring motorcycles. So that's part of the gross margin deterioration that we just spoke about on the call today.","But product is a very key lever for us. It's one of our four focus areas to increase both the cadence and the impact of the product and 2016 is a good example of both, high-impact product at an increased cadence. And 2017 is going to be no different. It's a formula that's working for us and we've invested more heavily, both capital and expense as part of the demand driving shift to make sure that the product that we deliver makes a difference in the marketplace and that we do it well and we do it more rapidly. And so, that's a new pattern for us that we can expect rolling forward in 2017, 2018 and beyond.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush. James, your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking a couple follow-ups here. So, the gain on sale with HDFS, I guess help us understand. I'm assuming that that gain comes out of future potential income that we would have otherwise seen in a normal securitization transaction. How should we think about that?","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, James. It's a good question. In the 8-K that we put out, we talked about this overall transaction is neutral when you look at the present value of earnings per share. So, it's a great question. Basically, here's what happened. What happens is, in a securitization we sell off a bunch of bonds to investors and it goes into a trust and all the residual earnings that we get off of that we keep, because we keep the risk and we keep that reward. What we did (50:43) a slightly different market and we found an investor to buy that and what they did is they paid us a bunch of upfront cash to buy that residual interest in the trust or those trailing earnings.","We believe that the opportunity cost of the transaction that we did is about $7 million of those trailing earnings, so to do broad math, we took a $9 million gain, gave up about $7 million of opportunity cost, so they would have earned about $16 million. We took $9 million today, right. So if you take and you discount over the next seven years, that $7 million that would have come in, bring it to the present value, a net impact on EPS, along with the fact that because it's off balance sheet, we have freed up equity at HDFS to maintain the same debt-to-equity, we've now got more equity, so HDFS wrote a check that works out to be $43 million and we bought shares back with that. And if you take that impact on EPS, they're about neutral. So the question is, well, why did we do it if it's neutral? Number one is that once you get into a market, you don't know how the market is going to exactly respond, but there's two reasons that we did this.","Number one is it's an additional source of liquidity, so we're always looking for opportunities on more investors, more liquidity, and this is a great opportunity. The other thing with the additional liquidity opportunity, we also learned that we can monetize the assets on our balance sheet to some extent. And that is very important to know. So that's number one reason. Number two and the more important reason is, is one of our \u2013 we talk about it every conference call, a top priority of ours is to return value to our shareholders in the form of rising dividends and share repurchases, and we will look at every opportunity to do that with the caveat that we're not going to do anything to damage the long-term value of the brand or the company.","This transaction fits squarely in there. There is absolutely no extra risk to the company or anything like that. What it did is it liberated $43 million of excess cash. That excess cash was used to buy share repurchases. And even though again, from a present value basis, we're neutral on EPS, we believe that our long-term shareholders would prefer to have at this moment in time more equity in our company given the historically low PEs that we're trading at. And so they get the ownership today versus waiting over that period of time for the opportunity cost of that money.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","That's really helpful. And then maybe just two real quick hitters here. Inventories are going to be down domestically, are they also going to be \u2013 or I'm sorry, flat domestically, are they also going to be flat internationally or will we see some growth there? And you also mentioned I think earlier in the Q&A that you maybe had some stats on oil areas versus non-oil areas, I was wondering if you'd care to share those? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Sure, James. Internationally, we do expect to grow modestly as well. We'll be adding a lot of dealerships this year and they're growing markets, and we would expect to add a little bit of inventory internationally.","The second quarter \u2013 sorry, so your second question is on oil dependent areas. We talked about this last quarter. It is certainly a headwind to the industry. And what we saw about a year ago, first quarter \u2013 well, first quarter 2015, we first noticed that those areas were declining more than other areas in the United States, obviously driven by the depression in oil prices. We saw that increase from a modest amount in the first quarter, increased through the second quarter and third quarter, and it hit about a 10% rate in the fourth quarter.","Now, we've seen that hold at 10% in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year, and the second quarter was also a 10%. As we look forward, we're going to start to lap more significant rises on a year-over-year basis, hopefully we'll start to see it temper a little bit, but at this point, it's not getting worse, but it is not getting better either.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Scott Hamann with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Scott, your line is open.","Scott W. Hamann - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the demand creation money that you're spending, is $70 million still a good number for this year? When did you kind of start to deploy that? Where are you seeing some of the best traction? And then would you consider spending more or even less as you kind of look forward? Thanks.","John A. Olin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Scott. Great question. So, again, going back to a year-ago, we tried some things in the second quarter and third quarter, some worked, some didn't. We kind of regrouped, looked at what was working, what wasn't, and we sized the overall opportunity. We came back as a company and said we needed $70 million to really address the widened price gaps which is a headwind to us, and compete without lowering price or discounting. And we got into the marketplace early in the first quarter, $70 million and again we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of new people coming in, being trained on through our Rider Academy, the motorcycles that they're buying with that, the demos that are going on, Live Your Legend campaign, again Heroes Ride Free that promotion that we're getting, people that identify very closely with our brand, getting them free training to get on motorcycles, all of that is working well and you're seeing that manifests itself in our competitiveness with expanded price gaps in the second quarter.","In terms of where we go with the $70 million? That's something that we evaluate on an ongoing basis. And not only the overall dollar amount of the buck \u2013 of the $70 million, we will look at, and change when need be whether that'd be more or less. We're also looking at what's working and what's not, and trying to become very nimble on how we redirect the money in the right spots whether that be within a market or between markets, or within a promotion or between promotions. There is nothing but a single-minded focus here on driving demand.","Amy Giuffre - Director-Investor Relations","Hi. Thank you everyone for your time this morning.

You can access the slides supporting this call at investor.harley-davidson.com. Click the earnings materials box in the center of the page. Adjacent to that link, you can find our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan support materials.","Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","Joining me this morning are President and CEO, Matt Levatich; and CFO John Olin. Matt let's get started.","Matt Levatich","Thanks Shannon and good morning everyone. Our strategy is clear, route to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally. With our objectives through 2027, we're executing a plan to accelerate our progress through 2022 More Roads to Harley-Davidson. We're acting with agility and discipline to take advantage of rapidly evolving global markets. In the short eight months since we announced More Roads, we've built our capabilities and met each of our planned milestones. Our progress in near-term results reinforce that we are indeed on the right strategic path and what we're doing is working.","The next generation of Harley-Davidson riders is emerging evidenced by new and different people who are taking interest in buying Harley-Davidson motorcycles today. The data tells us that 278,000 new riders joined Harley-Davidson in 2018 in the United States. This group is the most diverse across age, ethnicity and gender in all the years we've tracked this data.","Of the total mix of new riders, 18 to 34-year olds women and\/or ethnically diverse riders, comprised over 50% of the 2018 total and each segment's participation is up compared to five years ago. These results continued into 2019. Of the total U.S. new retail sales in Q1, the mix of 18 to 34-year olds was up 2.6 percentage points and the number of young people participating in Riding Academy and taking test rides was also up over last year.","It's worth noting that while our intense focus remains on our More Roads delivery, it's also squarely on managing our business through the significant and very real pressures we're facing across the global motorcycle industry, including the impact of the ongoing trade wars. While these challenges require prudent management and attention, our long-term objectives remain our beacon and we're after them with unwavering commitment and determination.","In the first quarter, we added horsepower through targeted investments to propel us even further. Our teams around the world are leveraging our brand and the best products we've ever offered through increased awareness, relevance, trial and sales. We're more integrated in our approach, bringing in new talent and deploying an arsenal of tools aligned with our stronger dealers and broader access growth catalysts. And as the data I shared earlier demonstrates, we're inspiring new types of customers.","In the U.S., increased marketing support that started earlier in the season, reached more consumers and drove action. We deployed targeted consumer offers in the marketplace during the quarter. And with smarter application of these investments, we saw a positive impact on sales and market share. The bulk of the effort and support in Q1 however was in our equity marketing efforts and in the increased and more focused support we provided as part of our stronger dealers work.","Harley-Davidson is increasingly showing up in relevant and unexpected places with current products and future electric lightweight prototypes, a lineup that soon will include an innovative entry in the large and growing pedal-assist electric bicycle market. We're at places where potential new riders are and can engage with us, CES, the Geneva Auto Show, X-Games, World Surf League and soon Formula E racing.","Our efforts drove PR and media impressions up from about 400 million to 2 billion in Q1 this year and global traffic to h-d.com was up 29%. In line with our stronger dealers growth catalyst, we're amplifying our work shoulder to shoulder with our dealers to build retail capabilities that lead to greater profitability and improved customer experience. This quarter, we began executing 2019 actions that will ramp throughout the year and we saw a positive impact from a number of actions, including a dealer support model with aligned policies to establish a consistent definition of performance and ensure that both we and dealers are focused on serving our customers. Dealers are now rewarded more clearly for retail performance and objective metrics are aligned with our company objectives.","Our new performance consulting resource groups completed nearly 50 dealer visits to help improve aspects specific to each dealer's operations, leading to increased traffic and retail sales across the engagements. We also launched programs to help dealers improve response time and quality of online and in-dealership leads, and our restructured field team was fully engaged to support dealers during the quarter.","Our competitiveness is essential as we continue to manage our business through one of the most dynamic and challenging business environments we've experienced in our history. The underlying industry trends persist and we continue to make prudent operating decisions in light of that.","We're pleased to see our efforts impact the U.S. industry and our performance within it. We're on the right track, more is needed and that's what we expect More Roads will deliver.","During the quarter, we saw proof in the wisdom of our Thailand manufacturing investment. We started supplying motorcycles to emerging ASEAN markets from our Thailand operations late last year. The tariff mitigation we realized allowed more competitive pricing and access to more customers.","As a result, we saw Q1 retail sales in emerging ASEAN markets increase by 126%. We plan to supply China from Thailand by the end of the year, further leveraging the value of this aspect of our strategy.","I'm also very pleased that our Wisconsin unions ratified new five-year agreements earlier this month that will allow us to remain competitive in the core of our U.S. manufacturing base and give us the stability we need to help address the challenges of today while we advance our long-term plans.","The support and readiness of our employees and dealers is critical as we enable promising new products under our More Roads plan, game-changing products that dramatically expand our consumable reach and growth potential.","Consider this, today we participate in segments that represent approximately 40% of the global 601+cc volume. When we deliver our new middleweight motorcycles under More Roads, we'll compete in segments representing nearly 90% of that global volume. Add to that, the opportunities we have in global lower displacement and electric segments.","We're on the -- we're on track to launch these new middleweight models beginning with a Streetfighter and an Adventure Touring model next year. With all the new middleweight models, we aim to have a powerful Harley-Davidson presence in some of the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing motorcycle segments.","Other More Roads progress in Q1 included progress toward a partnership for a premium small displacement offering in Asia to expand our reach in that region. We're just over a year away from launching our first model that will help provide access to millions of customers in emerging markets in the region.","With the acquisition of StaCyc, we've extenuated our efforts to build more riders, kids who are enjoying two-wheeled freedom with their families connecting through Harley-Davidson dealerships and events.","Starting at $649 StaCyc products further broaden the spectrum we've promised in the electric two-wheel space. We're serious about leading the electrification of motorcycling as part of inspiring the next generation to ride and to firmly rooting our place in the future of mobility.","Owning a Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric motorcycle is just months away. Dealers are booking preorders and installing DC fast charging stations and are already seeing opportunity to unfold. Our dealer in San Antonio tells us that immediately after his charging station went live, potential customers were coming to his store, shopping while their vehicle is charged.","Our efforts are igniting interest. Our social media listening reveals Harley-Davidson electric vehicle strategy is extremely positive and is driving over 50% of category social media conversation.","In about one-quarter of the initial interest in LiveWire including preorders is from young adult\u2019s, new people with new ideas about two-wheel freedom under the Harley-Davidson brand. Our brand remains our vanguard known worldwide consistently and powerfully. I believe there is more we can do with and within the Harley-Davidson brand to drive relevance and inspire ridership.","During the quarter, I hired Neil Grimmer as our first ever Brand President. As part of our More Roads plan, Neil will bring together our consumer facing teams around the world to invigorate Harley-Davidson experience. The teams will deliver a global brand force that resonates with new riders and engages today's riders even more deeply to support our growth and the incredible bond our brand is known for.","Neil brings over 20 years of experience in innovative company and brand building, and has a strong affinity for riding and our brand experience. In fact, he rode his Street Glide from Oakland to Milwaukee last week, visiting dealers along the way for a strong start.","In summary, our strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders continues to be our true north and our direction clarity and conviction could not be more sound.","In all I've shared including the examples of More Roads progress, three things are clear. First, we're continuing to invest in our future and bring even more horsepower to our efforts and actions to drive increased value for all our stakeholders. Second, we're carefully managing our business through the challenges and toward the opportunities ahead. And third, global market conditions are continuing to evolve and so are we with agility, determination and the grit that has defined Harley-Davidson throughout our history. We along with our dealers are flat-out determined to continue our leadership and stimulate global industry growth.","And now, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results of the quarter. John?","John Olin","Thanks, Matt. Our first quarter financial results came in a stronger than we anticipated, driven by higher shipments, and stronger operating margins than we had planned.","We were encouraged by our retail sales performance in the first quarter, despite the adverse impact that our recent recall had on availability of our Street motorcycles. But we also remain cautious as we move into the height of the selling season.","The summary for Q1 results is on slide 11. In the first quarter, motorcycle operating income was impacted by lower shipments, unfavorable mix, and incremental tariffs, partially offset by lower year-over-year SG&A, and lower restructuring charges. Financial Services operating income was down 7.6%.","Consolidated net income was down versus prior year due to lower operating income. EPS for the quarter was $0.80. When excluding restructuring plan costs and the impact of incremental tariffs, EPS was $0.98.","In the face of ongoing retail sales headwinds in the United States, we remain focused and disciplined on tightening U.S. retail inventories, aggressively managing cost, generating cash flow from operations and delivering strong shareholder returns over the long-term.","On slide 12, Worldwide Retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Q1 were down 3.8% versus prior year. For the quarter, retail sales of Street motorcycles were slight -- were significantly impacted by limited availability following a re-call announced in January.","Sales of Street motorcycles reassumed in late March, slightly ahead of our expectations. Excluding Street motorcycles sales, first quarter Worldwide Retail sales were up 0.4%.","In the U.S., first quarter retail sales were down 4.2% versus prior year. The decline was driven by continued weak industry results, partially offset by gains in our Q1 market share.","International retail sales were down in the first quarter, driven by very limited availability of Street motorcycles. While Q1 retail sales have significantly improved from recent sales trends.","We expect our business remain under pressure in 2019, driven by continuing challenges in the U.S. motorcycle industry. We continue to aggressively manage supply. And execute our marketing efforts to encourage trial, create new riders and increase conversion to sale.","We also continue to introduce exciting new products and add innovation that customers value on our new motorcycles. In February, we introduced the Electra Glide Standard at a U.S. MSRP of $18,999. Early sales of this model and feedback from dealers have been very positive.","We believe our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan is building the proper foundation and driving the right fundamentals to help steer the U.S. industry back to health and will drive significant growth across our International markets.","Now let's take a closer look at the U.S. on slide 13. Retail sales were down versus the prior year quarter, as a result of continued headwinds within the U.S. industry, partially offset by Harley-Davidson, market share gains.","Our Q1 decline of 4.2% represents the lowest rate of decline over the last nine quarters and was accomplished in an incredibly competitive marketplace. The U.S. industry was down 4.7% in the quarter, which also represented an improvement versus recent industry sales trends.","We believe the U.S. industry for new bikes continues to be challenged by soft used bike prices. We also believe that the improvement in U.S. industry sales trend was due in part to highly competitive and promotional marketplace.","Looking at used bikes, we see prices remaining at low levels compared to new. However, we are encouraged by the firming of used bike prices over the past several quarters. During the quarter, prices of used Harley-Davidson bikes in our dealer network rose for the seventh consecutive quarter. 2019 Q1 market share of new bike registrations was 51.1%, up 0.6 percentage points.","Our U.S. market share gains were driven by the execution of our stronger dealers growth catalyst, which included increased marketing and sales support, and was partially offset by what we believe to be increased competitive promotional activity, and stronger performance in segments which we do not currently complete, but will next year as part of our More Roads plan.","In the segments where we do compete, the touring and cruisers segments, which represent approximately 70% of the 601+cc market, our market share was up 2.5 percentage points for the quarter.","During the quarter, we tightly managed shipments of new bikes into the dealer network. This resulted in quarter end U.S. retail inventory decreasing approximately 3,450 motorcycles over the prior year.","We are very pleased with our dealers' inventory levels and the mix of products in the field, as we move into the height of the selling season. We believe this market discipline is important in maintaining customer and dealer value, and will ultimately result in stronger retail sales of new motorcycles.","On slide 14, first quarter International retail sales were down 3.3% versus prior year. Q1 sales were down as a result of lower developed market sales, partially offset by higher emerging-market sales.","International retail sales were significantly impacted by the lack of Street motorcycles available for sale in the quarter. Excluding Street motorcycles, Q1 International retail sales were up 7.7% -- 4.7%.","During the fourth quarter, emerging market retail sales were up 5.2% driven by double-digit growth in numerous markets. Retail sales in developed international markets were down 6.2% in the first quarter.","Retail sales in Japan and Australia continued to be weak in Q1, behind contracting industry sales and competitive new product introductions in segments outside of touring and Cruisers. We continue to support our dealers in these markets, with incentives and a strong focus on a national test ride campaign.","Our full year market share in Europe was 8.8%, down 1.6 percentage points versus the prior year. As a detail on our More Roads plan reinforces, we remain confident in and committed to the great potential that international markets offer to Harley-Davidson.","Furthermore, with our Thailand facility up and running, we are excited about the growth opportunities in ASEAN region now that we can offer more competitive pricing. We believe our brand, products and distribution will drive sustained growth in international markets.","On slide 15, wholesale motorcycle shipments were down 7.9% in the quarter. Q1 shipments came in higher than our guidance of 53,000 to 58,000 motorcycles, as a result of higher-than-expected U.S. retail sales. In addition, we were able to ship more Street motorcycles late in the quarter than we had planned, as a result of receiving replacement parts earlier than expected. Comparing mix to last year's first quarter, Sportster shipments as a percent of total were up behind improved sales rate, offset by lower percentage of Touring shipments.","On slide 16, revenue for the Motorcycle segment was down 12.3% in the first quarter behind a 7.9% decrease in year-over-year motorcycle shipments. Revenue during the quarter was adversely impacted by a $1,163 decrease in the average motorcycle revenue per bike. This decrease was driven by unfavorable mix, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and increased sales support, partially offset by higher year-over-year pricing. Both P&A and general merchandise sales were largely in line with retail sales growth in the first quarter.","On slide 17, gross margin in Q1 was down as a result of lower shipments, higher manufacturing expense and unfavorable mix in currency exchange. Manufacturing was unfavorable versus prior year, driven largely by the impact of incremental tariffs, lower absorption on reduced production and shipments, and temporary inefficiencies. Q1 tariff costs increased by $21.0 million, driven by incremental EU and China tariffs.","Product mix was unfavorable by $26.9 million in the quarter, driven by higher shipment mix of our Sportster motorcycles. Q1 revenue was down 2.4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which was partially offset by hedge gains. As a result, Q1 gross margin was unfavorable by $15.1 million. Finally, raw material costs were higher during the quarter, with increased steel cost. ","On slide 18, operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q1 was lower compared to last year driven by lower gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A and restructuring expense. Q1 SG&A benefited from lower year-over-year net warranty and recall expense and aggressive expense management, partially offset by higher marketing investments.","Restructuring charges for manufacturing optimization totaled $14.0 million for the first quarter of 2019 versus $46.8 million in 2018. Profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus. It is our objective to further leverage our established capabilities to continue to drive profit cash flow and top quartile ROIC sustainably.","Financial Services segment first quarter operating income, shown on slide 19, was $58.7 million, down 7.6% compared to the prior year. Net interest income was up $1.9 million due to higher year-over-year receivables. The provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was $4.9 million unfavorable in the quarter. The provision increased as a result of higher credit losses and higher receivables.","Operating expenses were up versus prior year as a result of a reporting change in which Harley-Davidson Dealer Systems business moved from the Motorcycle segment to the Financial Services segment and due to higher depreciation as a result of our investment in a new loan management system, which went live on January 1.","HDFS operational results are on slide 20. Q1 originations were up 5.4% versus prior year, driven by higher market share and increased financing of used motorcycle sales in the dealer network. Market share was 64.5%, up a very strong 5.9 percentage points during the quarter, driven by our Q1 financing promotion, competitive U.S. retail rates and HDFS' continued commitment to full credit spectrum lending.","At the end of the quarter's end, there was $365.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and $952.1 million of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities. During Q1, HDFS paid dividends of $45.0 million to Harley-Davidson Inc. and also issued $550 million three-year MTN.","On slide 21, Q1 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loan receivables on our Q1, 2019 balance sheet was 3.73% or 42 basis points higher than Q1, 2018. The annualized retail credit loss rate for receivables on balance sheet was 2.22% or seven basis points higher than 2018.","We believe inefficiencies resulting from the implementation of our new loan management system were a big driver in the higher 30-day delinquency rate and increased loss rate. We expect these inefficiencies to be temporary. HDFS continues to maintain a robust liquidity position and contributed strong profitability to the company.","The remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financial results are summarized on slide 22. Our quarter end cash and marketable securities balance was $759.6 million flat to last year. Year-to-date operating cash flow was down $158.9 million driven by higher working capital and lower net income.","Regarding liquidity the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash or committed credit facilities. We believe the charts on slide 23 demonstrate that we are a leader in ROIC at the Motor Company and ROE at HDFS, and we are a clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders. One of the five objectives guiding our business strategies and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by Motor Company ROIC being in the top quartile of the S&P 500 and by a best-in-class return on equity at HDFS.","Slide 24 illustrates the recent history of returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of 2019, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.375 per share or an increase of 1.4% and repurchased $52.6 million of our stock. Driving superior value for our shareholders is our top priority.","We will continue to look for opportunities to grow value through investments that maximize the performance and long-term potential of the company and the brand. We have a robust and disciplined process for our investment decisions. After investing in our business, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and share repurchases.","On slide 25 is a summary of our multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative. Consistent with last quarter, we expect total program operating cost to be between $152 million and $162 million with a capital investment of $65 million. We also continue to expect manufacturing optimization to yield ongoing cash savings of $65 million to $75 million after 2020.","In Q1, we incurred $17.6 million of operating optimization costs. In Q2, we expect manufacturing optimization costs of approximately $20 million. We believe these investments have very attractive returns. When completed, we expect this initiative will simplify our manufacturing footprint, provide focus on our operational investments and improve gross margin by roughly 1.25 percentage points.","Moving on to 2019 guidance on slide 26. Our 2019 full year guidance remains unchanged. In the second quarter, we expect to ship approximately 65,500 to 70,500 motorcycles down 3% to 10% versus prior year. In the second quarter, we expect motorcycle operating margin to be down approximately four percentage points versus last year driven in part by the impact of the incremental tariffs and lower planned shipments and unfavorable mix.","In the first quarter, Harley-Davidson again demonstrated its incredible resilience in the face of challenging headwinds by delivering improved retail sales trends and a better-than-expected financial performance. We also delivered value to our shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases all while taking key steps toward -- to deliver our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2019, we are cautiously encouraged by the momentum of recent retail sales trends, but also understand we face substantial headwinds including an extremely competitive U.S. marketplace and incremental tariffs. We are all well-prepared -- we are well-prepared to face these challenges and committed to driving long-term growth for the company and strong returns for our shareholders.","Thank you. Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein.","David Beckel","Hi. Thanks for the question. I just had a question about your outlook for the remainder of the year. Has Q1 changed anything? And John, you had said I believe I have this right that you remain cautious heading into peak season despite a better-than-expected Q1. Is there any reason to believe that some of the drivers of improved sales in Q1 will not be as effective going forward? Thanks.","John Olin","Thanks, Dave. First, before I answer Dave's question, in the prepared remarks I had mentioned on the gross margin bridge that mix was unfavorable impact of $26.9 million. On the slides and the actual number is $39.3 million. Apologize for that mistake.","All right. Dave with regards to our outlook for the remainder of the year has anything in Q1 changed that? The answer is absolutely not. We had a very good quarter in the first quarter. Again came in better from a financial standpoint. And operating margins, we were looking -- expecting to be down six percentage points we came in down 3.6 points. The driver of that was largely with more favorable SG&A than we had anticipated as well as slightly more favorable mix. Even though mix was very unfavorable, it was more favorable than we intended. But our outlook remains the same. We expect operating margins to be 8% to 9% on a full year basis.","And there was a comment that was made with regards to we're looking -- we're cautious as we move into the height of the selling season and are the drivers any different? The answer is, absolutely not. The drivers are not different. Matter of fact, we learned a lot in the first quarter. A lot of things that worked very well for us as we integrated the approach between our stronger dealers growth catalyst, as well as increased marketing investment. And a lot of that -- those things that worked well, we'll repeat as we move throughout the year. So, there is nothing with regards to what we saw in the first quarter that doesn't give us encouragement and confidence in the rest of the year.","The comment was meant and then said largely, because of the fact that the reality of the first quarter represents about 21% of our retail sales, and as we move into the second quarter it's a much bigger quarter and represent about 37% of our year. And so, we've got a plan. The plan is in place. The plan is working and we're executing against it, and we feeling very good as we move forward.","David Beckel","Great. And if I could -- a quick follow-up. I know you're restricted to one question. But was the promotional expense associated with those targeted advertisements inclusive or part of your overall expectations for your projections for the year? Or was it higher than expected?","John Olin","No. It's in line with our plans and it's certainly incorporated in our full margin guidance of 8% to 9%.","David Beckel","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird.","Craig Kennison","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, could you expand on the objectives of this new Brand President role and why you felt you needed to add that role?","Matt Levatich","Yeah. Thanks, Craig. One of the things that we -- wherever I go in the world, the power and the sort of meaning of the Harley-Davidson brand just stands out. And we -- I believe that the brand itself is in essence a fourth growth catalyst. How do we think about better leveraging? How we show up as a brand in every way that we show up as a brand whether that's through motorcycle product, apparel product, retail, design, obviously the digital presence through -- which is increasingly important and every aspect of marketing, but including commerce through H-D.com and showing up in a unified and powerful way, both for existing riders and to inspire future riders.","This is a move to bring unity and leverage the power of the brand even further through, again, all the ways we show up as a brand to consumers to create a very compelling and inspiring reason for them to join the sport of motorcycling and join it on a Harley-Davidson product.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi Group.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Yeah. Can you talk just a little bit about the broader political tariff background that you're seeing today? It seems like the U.S. could potentially reciprocate tariffs against the EU tariffs. Today President Trump mentioned that the European Union tariffs hitting Harley-Davidson are \"unfair\". So how is that impacting your thinking today on that topic?","Matt Levatich","Hi. This is Matt. I'll take that. Just to back up a little bit here on this that we're impacted by the trade wars in a number of different ways. The input costs as we've mentioned on prior calls with steel and aluminum raw material, we're managing as an ordinary course in our business. We're not as impacted with tariffs on Chinese imports, because we don't import much from China.","The big impact for us is the European Union tariffs and nothing has changed since the European Union increased the import tariff from 6% to 31% last June. It is on the books as -- in conjunction with that act last June that that tariff will increase another 25 points in June of 2021 to 56 points total -- represent total. And so we're pursuing our strategy as we've talked about many times to get to the European Union marketplace through our international manufacturing footprint. We have a strong case that's at the European -- at the Belgian authority within the European Union and we're waiting approval. Should that approval be denied we have other plans to continue to pursue a strategy to enter Europe at the base rate of 6%.","Clearly, this is an imperative for us as a business. And as I've said many times before, we're continuing in our path and we'll continue to execute that strategy unless and until the circumstances change in this environment. And it's unfortunate, but we're pushing forward with our strategy to make sure that we preserve the integrity and the growth potential within the European market. It's a significant part of our business today. It's even more important to us as we bring on the new middleweight products that play very well into international markets, particularly European markets. So, the growth production that's represented in that we cannot afford it to be hamstrung with incremental tariffs that are currently at 31% and scheduled to get to 56%, two years basically from today.","So, that's our situation. We're working through it. We're very confident in our application, and in our contingency plan should that application not be approved.","Greg Badishkanian","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thank you for the question, and good morning. I just -- Matt just as a little tag along to that answer when you\u2019re just talking about your alternative plans, was that referring to the potential for the knockdown facility in Europe?","Matt Levatich","Europe has always been an option as we looked at how to mitigate the EU retaliatory tariffs. It wasn't our preferred option. Thailand was. So we have a number of other alternatives that we have at our disposal, should that approval not come our way.","Again, we have a very strong case in front of the authority today. We're awaiting that approval, and we're prepared in the event that that approval doesn't come. And that includes Europe as a possibility just as -- that's always been a possibility from the beginning of this situation.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Matt Levatich","Thank you.","Felicia Hendrix","John, in your prepared comments, when you\u2019re talking about market share, you'd said, you faced a headwind due to certain segments in which you don't compete, but you will later in the year. That seems like a little teaser to me, so I was wondering if you could elaborate on that at all.","John Olin","Well, when we look at overall market share or the segment of the 601+cc market in the United States, it's comprised of six segments. We participate in three of them Felicia, and that's touring large cruiser and small cruiser, somewhat of a mixed number because those are very large bikes as well, and those are Street and Sportster.","Within that that segment of the market has been declining at a faster rate than the other part of the market, which represents about 30% of the sales. And those are segments of the standard segment, dual and performance segments. So in the segments that we compete in, overall we gain market share during the quarter of 0.6%.","In the segments that we compete in our market was up 2.5 percentage points. And the comment was that with More Roads and the new middleweight that Matt mentioned, in less than six quarters here, we will be participating in 100% of the markets in the United States. So we will enter into the performance with the Streetfighter and in the dual segment with an Adventure Touring, and in the standard segment with the lower displacement motorcycles.","And obviously, they don't come with -- those are all incremental sales. They don't have used bikes in the United States. But even more exciting is the part of the world market and the world market is much bigger in terms of streetfighting and performance and traditional segments than the United States is.","And in Matt's prepared comments, he had mentioned that right now we are in the addressable market of about 41% of the world's market. And with the new middleweight coming out, that will be in excess of roughly 90% in six short quarters. So we couldn't be more thrilled with regards to our overall More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan, and entering with the world's most powerful brand into many segments that we don't currently compete today.","Matt Levatich","And I'm just going to add, John that we're also eyes wide open to how competitive those segments are from a performance technology and pricing perspective. So we're clear eyed in the nature of our investment to deliver products that are going to be head to head with some formidable competitors, and we aim to complete and grow with our entry into those segments.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Can I just ask a quick question on HDFS? John, can you just walk through the thought process behind the March madness? Just wondering, that promotion that you did -- I was just wondering what the driver was. And to what extent do you think that accelerated retail sales in the quarter?","John Olin","I think you're referring to the finance promotion that we had 2.99%, and no down for the top tier? Yeah, it's very much a standard promotion that we've run in the past. Matter of fact, we ran it last year in the second quarter. And it is just on our Touring bikes and Softail. We offer it through the top three tiers. And the top tier has got a lower rate than standard of 2.99% and no money down. And we ran it beginning in, I believe, February 11 through the end of the quarter. And people buying the motorcycle at that time had the opportunity to have preferable finance rate. We're very pleased with what we saw during the promotion.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So now that the Street bikes are back to being shipped again, is that fully accounted for in the second quarter or whatever you believe you can make up from the lost sales in the first quarter?","John Olin","I'm sorry, Jaime, I think the question was, is with Street back will we catch up on those overall sales?","Jaime Katz","Right. Is that all embedded in the second quarter outlook that you expect?","John Olin","I\u2019m sorry. Yes. I'm sorry. It is fully accounted for in the second quarter guidance, which we have as down 3% to 10%. And again, when you look at the first half, obviously our shipment guidance is down more than what we expect on a full year basis. And this is in line with a lot of our competition that we had in the first quarter, or as we exited the year is that we look to keep inventories very tight in the first half and through the selling season. And to that end, inventories were down 3,450 units in the first quarter. We feel very good about where inventories stand in the dealer network and certainly the mix of that inventory. And we're excited about having Street back in the lineup in the second quarter.","Q \u2013 Jaime Katz","And then, last quarter you called out weakness in both the U.K. and France and it looks like France has dropped off of at least the slide commentary. So could you articulate whether there has been any change in that region worse or better? Thank you.","A \u2013 John Olin","Yes. Certainly, in the fourth quarter, France was going through some consumer confidence declines, largely we believe driven by the yellow jacket protests. And we saw our volumes down a fair amount in the fourth quarter in France. And that has reversed in the first quarter and we saw good growth in France in the first quarter. Likewise, the U.K. we called out last quarter. Again lack of consumer confidence driven by what we believe to be Brexit and that unfortunately has continued. And we saw retail sales in the U.K. in the first quarter down double digit. And there's a lot of uncertainty driven by Brexit. There's a lot of business uncertainty and certainly a lot of consumer uncertainty and that has now been extended through October. So we got a close eye on that market. We're working on marketing programs. But right now, there's just a lot of uncertainty in the market.","Q \u2013 Jaime Katz","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities.","Q \u2013 James Hardiman","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So Matt and John, I think you guys both talked about better recent sales trends. Maybe to the extent you feel comfortable quantify that talk about that. It sounds like maybe March was a little bit better. And then to the extent that they were relevant, I guess maybe talk about the earlier Street shipments that you got if that impacted retail. Obviously, you talked about it impacting wholesale as well as the equity marketing promos if that impacted things and then EagleRider I know that that moves around quite a bit.","A \u2013 John Olin","All right. The recent sales trends I think was the first part of that James. And yes, in the first quarter, we saw certainly increased sales momentum. In January, retail sales were down let's call it well into the double digit. In February, retail sales were near double-digit down. And in March, which is -- represents the same size as both January and February combined was up mid-single digits. And we feel the drivers clearly are investment in our stronger dealer\u2019s growth catalyst as well as increased marketing and brand support that we had in the quarter.","And a lot of that takes time to take hold and certainly the selling season starts in the March time frame. So we're very pleased with the trends that we saw during the quarter. We're certainly very pleased with the things that we're doing with the dealer network and on the media side. Media was up about 90% during the quarter, increased marketing events and brand work. Again, we're investing $100 million in More Roads this year. All those things are working for us and we saw that pay off late in the quarter.","The question -- I believe there was a question on Street. Street, we again expected to be out for the entire quarter and last quarter, we talked about at retail that would be about 2,500 units. It wasn't quite that much. It was more around 2,100 units that was affected by Street. The reason it was little bit less is that parts availability which was expected to come in in the first half of April, came in at the back half of March. So we were able to get kits out as well as ship some Street motorcycles at the end of the quarter. And some of those did get retailed James about 400 more than we had anticipated.","With regards to EagleRider, when we started with EagleRider a couple of years ago, we were a little bit off cadence in terms of quarter-over-quarter versus what we had in authorized rentals. This year, we're dead on in terms of the overall shipment cadence. And so EagleRider was not an impact to the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. So when we talk about Street that was -- the global number is up 400 units, that's across all markets.","Q \u2013 James Hardiman","Okay. And the promo, I mean certainly it seems like pretty massive turnaround in March. How much do you think that equity marketing promo impacted that?","A \u2013 John Olin","I don't know. It's an integrated approach. This is not one thing that we're doing. We're doing all type of things. And the stronger dealer growth catalyst had all kinds of things going. We had reorganized the sales organization. We created dealer performance intensives, instituted sales and marketing, performance consulting, exited underperforming dealers, a lot of focus on test rides, driving sales with lead management. In addition to that, we had a lot more marketing going on. So within that, there was a couple sales and support incentives. And that was the finance offer. The Freedom Promise was going, which we did in the year ago period.","And then, we worked some positive equity leads with our dealers from HDFS, loans that have positive equity and provided a private offer for that. So all those in concert, James did the trick and we feel good about how the performed. Again, we learned a lot and we'll apply that a lot for the remainder of the year. And we feel very good about our plan as we move into the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Conder, Wells Fargo Securities.","Q \u2013 Tim Conder","Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on that on the promotional side, collectively, John or Matt anyone who wants to take this? Are your promotions different or the volume of those different as percentage basis year-over-year? Or is the mix that can direct-to-consumer, is that different within the overall promotions?","And then, as a result of that, John, you alluded to about the HDFS delinquencies having some issues with the systems transitions. If we look at that though, I mean, we're setting at 373. And we haven't been at that level since 2011.","What do you think that as you get the system now kicked back? You'd expect that to come down? Where can we kind of see that level out? I guess any color you can give from that perspective.","A \u2013 Matt Levatich","All right, the first question is with regards to promotions are they different? One is on the financing offer, it's not different in anyway. But at last quarter we ran it at the beginning of April and this quarter we ran it a little bit earlier. So, that's different and the timing is different.","And again, that was in support of all the other things that we were doing in the marketplace. Freedom Promise, we ran last year, very successful. And what that does is provides opportunity for some of the trade-up and had a credit for what they paid for a Sportster to trade-up to a larger Harley. So that the same.","In terms of some of the stuff that we're doing with HDFS, and using the positive equity loans. That is new. And we feel very good. Our dealers certainly are using those leads and working with them. And we're seeing good results from that. So, I don't see a tremendous amount of difference, but that one is different.","A \u2013 John Olin","I would just add, James that in general, the teams are becoming much more surgical and the application of reaching different customers on the terms that the customers are going to respond to. So, the positive equity leads being an example, of leveraging the data and the insight that we have about consumers to be much more targeted and appealing to them in ways that are going to inspire them.","We are in a very competitive general industry environment and the finance promo, that John referenced, is sort of a headline rate to just to be sure that we don't -- we aren't dismissed from anybody's consideration set given what's going on in the broader industry. And it's all supported with much sharper and broader top line marketing investment to create and drive awareness trial, test rides and so forth.","And then you start bringing in some of the specific changes within stronger dealers, that John mentioned, plus things like the dealers and our sales being much sharper with lead and contact and customer follow-up to just continue engaging with consumers to take them down the path to purchase and to enjoy riding.","A \u2013 Matt Levatich","All right, Jim, the second part of your question was with regards to delinquency and credit loss at HDFS. During the quarter, we did kind of break trend of what we've seen in the last five quarters, which were improvements across both delinquencies and losses.","Delinquencies jump 42 basis points and credit losses up seven. The main driver of that was the implementation of a new loan management system. So, this is a huge driver of our business at HDFS. And we had an order system. And we need to be replaced for one, and two, given regulatory changes in loan level detail, we needed implement the system.","Team has spent a fair amount of time putting the system in. We went live on January 1. And it went very, very well. We're very pleased with what happened at retail -- I'm sorry -- with the system.","And now having said that, we did experience some inefficiencies, in our collection process, largely due to the reporting as well as some on the repossession side and with that data caused delinquencies to jump 42 basis points and credit losses in the range of seven.","So, we would expect those to be temporary. And we expect a little bit of inefficiency, still remain in the second quarter and to be completely behind us by the third quarter. And so, it's just -- our view is just a blip in terms of the implementation of the system, again, which we feel very good about overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfa of William Blair.","Q \u2013 Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good morning. I'll stick to the one question with an add-on. But just on the SG&A, was there anything one-time in nature or was there timing difference between this quarter and the rest of the quarters? Because it was extremely well controlled, so can you give us some more color on that? And then just to clarify for the tariffs for this year, is it still $100 million to $120 million incremental?","John Olin","Thanks, Sharon. With regards to SG&A, we had three drivers of SG&A that we had mentioned. Is -- one is warranty and recall overall was favorable. The other piece of it is just in general, it can't really be parsed out that closely is overall the company has been very focused on expense management and being very prudent with the dollars that we have. And rallying cry for that has really been that any dollar we save gets reinvested in turning around the industry here in the United States and driving sales around the world. So a lot of incentive to be prudent with our spending, and we couldn't be prouder of the employee base and what we have done not this quarter, but over the last several quarters.","And then finally those two were offset by an increase in marketing spending, fair increase in marketing spending which has always been the plan. And we expect on a full year basis that our marketing spending will be up well into the double-digits all in concert with our More Roads investment, which we expect to be about $100 million this year.","Matt Levatich","And I'll just add on Sharon that within the macro number there's a significant amount of reallocation under the More Roads growth catalyst, which is our commitment to self-fund the pivot that we're doing as an organization so, everything John said plus a fair amount of reallocation of dollars we used to spend that we're now investing within and under the three growth catalysts.","John Olin","Your second question Sharon was with regards to incremental tariffs. We pay a lot of tariffs, but the incremental piece given the recent trade disputes is still expected to be on an annualized basis $100 million to $120 million. And again, we're looking to by the end of the year have the majority of our production coming from Thailand and avoiding those tariffs as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","Hi. Good morning. You know, March had a lot of consumer-facing offers the 2.99% the Freedom Promise. It seems like the targeted credits work probably the best, but with all of that, where is that hitting your P&L? Is that hitting HDFS? Or is that in your gross margin?","John Olin","So -- well they're all different types of promotions, Gerrick. So I'll start with the finance offer. When we do a below-rate financing what we do is we subvent that with HDFS, which means the Motor Company pays for the buy down of that rate and the cost of having no money down because there's risk to that rate. And so what happens in the quarter is that the Motor Company will pay HDFS. That is an expense in the quarter in which that happens. So it's in the first quarter so those are in first quarter results and they happen as a contra revenue -- in the revenue line item as a contra account.","Now the accounting from HDFS is a little bit different. They haven't earned that money yet because the loan hasn't gone through its paces. So that sits on the balance sheet and is accrued into -- released into earnings as the loan is paid down that got the benefit. So those are how that's accounted for. Freedom Promise is a little bit different. That is not an off invoice, but that is -- we forecast how much we believe that will cost in terms of people that will accept the offer, trade up the motorcycle and what we would need to pay the dealer because of them accepting the trade-in at the price that was paid. And again that's booked in the quarter that the offer is released.","Operator","Your final question comes from Brandon Rolle of Northcoast Research.","Brandon Rolle ","Hi. All my questions have been asked. Thank you.","Shannon Burns","Let's do one more.","Matt Levatich","Let's do one more then.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James.","Adam Tindle","Hi, guys. This is Adam on for Joe. So I believe you mentioned there's been some early LiveWire interest from a younger demographic. Would you mind walking us through kind of the pace of the rollout here? Maybe how many dealers expect to get the product this year?","Matt Levatich","Yes. This is Matt. So we're very pleased with the rollout. Everything is on track. We've got about 100 dealers that are signed up. As I mentioned in my remarks they're getting ready with the installation of DC fast charging, which is an enhanced charging infrastructure than what's typically out there. And as I mentioned, they're starting to see people in cars seek out the dealerships, because they've got faster charging capabilities. We've got a training circuit out in the field, traveling dealer-to-dealer to train the dealership staff not just on the product, but actually more so on the customer who's likely to be interested in LiveWire. And through the preorders that we're getting and the deposits that are received, we're able to plan specifically where the demand is for LiveWire here in the United States and with that better plan the ongoing rollout of LiveWire globally, so we know we can support it with the capacity that we have.","So everything is on track. Very encouraging signs with not just the age but the full nature of the consumer that's interested in LiveWire and the type of traffic and interest that it's driving to the dealer network and to the brand. And we're just at the very beginning of our EV initiative the tip of the spear being this really amazing LiveWire motorcycle.","Operator","Your final question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the question is really on the profitability of the middleweight bikes and I guess the new bikes that you're rolling out in the three new categories. Can you just talk a little bit about the expected profitability of those products? And you talked about the fact that you're entering more competitive markets. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of context here how they're going to compare with what you're offering now but also the ramp process. How long it's going to take you to ramp to get to that targeted margin level? And just any kind of color you can give us around that would be helpful. Thanks.","John Olin","Okay. Thanks, David. With regards to overall profitability, the middleweight bikes that come out will be very profitable at a very strong overall margin, but the margins will not be at the level that we currently see our Touring and Cruiser motorcycles which are the highest margins in the world. And \u2013 but those margins will be very \u2013 compared to any the motorcycle manufacturer the margins will be very attractive. And also obviously with the growth that we expect the middleweight to drive the spreading of the fixed cost in our plants also add a tremendous amount of opportunity for us. And as we've talked about before, while we have a gross margin in the 33%, 34% range each incremental volume unit that goes through our factories is in the 45% to 47% range, and so we pick up a lot with that as well.","The overall profitability and the ramp is really from day one, the gross margin will be set and there's not a lot to ramp-up. We got certainly startup costs that we will talk more about next year when we get closer to it, but those typically are a couple quarters before we get in it. But there's no big time to getting \u2013 realizing that profitability, right.","Shannon Burns","All right. Thanks everyone.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Amy Giuffre, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Amy Giuffre","Thank you, Beth, and welcome to Harley-Davidson's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. The audio for today's call is being webcast live on www.harley-davidson.com. The supporting [Audio Gap] can be accessed by clicking on Company, Investor Relations, then Events and Presentations.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.","This morning, you'll hear from Harley-Davidson's CEO, Keith Wandell; CFO, John Olin; and President of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Larry Hund. Then we'll open the call -- and then we'll open the call for your questions so let's get started. Keith?","Keith E. Wandell","Thank you, Amy, and good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. As we noted in the press release, we're pleased by the strong start to the year and I want to begin with a thanks to all of our employees, our dealers and our suppliers. They're really the frontline in our progress and they continue to do a great job at bringing the Harley-Davidson experience to our customers throughout the world. When I came to Harley-Davidson 3 years ago, I knew that the company had tremendous untapped potential and incredible opportunities and that's never been more true than today. It's through our strategy of transformation that we believe we will exceed the ever-increasing expectations of our customers, we will create opportunities for growth and we will build a sustainable business for the future. ","We continue to see the evidence of our progress in the numbers that we reported today. We believe the first quarter retail results and indeed the trend of the past several quarters reflect the outstanding appeal of our products and the efforts of our employees and the more than 1,400 dealers in 79 countries around the world along with the improving macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. ","Over the past few years, we have continued to bring out great products that are hitting the mark with our customers. The latest of these are the Seventy-Two and the Softail Slim, both of which were introduced just a couple of months ago. The Seventy-Two is inspired by the early chopper era taking its cues from the custom culture that still exists today along Whittier Boulevard in East LA, also known as Route 72. No one but Harley-Davidson could do a factory custom motorcycle like the Seventy-Two with its unique, big metal flake paint which requires a complex multistep paint process. ","Similarly, the Softail Slim returns the Softail motorcycle to its essential elements. With a low seat height, it comfortably fits a wide range of riders. And as with all of our motorcycles, customers can achieve a truly personalized fit through a wide variety of accessories, which is one of our competitive advantages. The Seventy-Two and the Softail Slim are just the latest new motorcycles that are reaching new customers. ","The Forty-Eight, which we introduced in early 2010, made the list of the top 10 sellers in Europe last year and that is a first for Harley-Davidson. ","The SuperLow, which we introduced in July of 2010, was recently cited by Power Sports Business as the #1 selling cruiser to women. ","Earlier this month, Moto-plismo [ph], which is a leading motorcycle publication in Brazil, Latin America and Europe, named the Night Rod Special its Moto de Oro, the top award in the custom category. ","These examples all point to the bigger story of Harley-Davidson's growing market leadership in the U.S. and growing strength in the international markets. It's all part of our strategy to increase the relevance of our motorcycles to more riders and it's working. ","We now have the 2011 outreach demographics sales data for the U.S. And once again, Harley-Davidson is the leader in on-road motorcycle registrations in all of our target demographic segments. We are the leader in sales to young adults, women, diverse customers, as well as our core customers and not just in the heavyweight segment. Among young adults aged 18 to 34, we captured the market leadership position in all displacements of on-road bikes in 2008 and expanded this leadership in the 2009 to 2011 timeframe. ","We are also #1 across all displacements among women, Hispanic and African-American riders. And so, if we look at just the heavyweight segment, in 2011, there's 4 points I'd like to make: number one, nearly half of all heavyweight motorcycles sold to young adults were Harley-Davidson's; number two, nearly 2\/3 of heavyweight motorcycles sold to women were Harley's; number three, we also sold more than half of all of our heavyweight motorcycles sold to African-American customers; and number four, nearly 6 in 10 heavyweight motorcycles sold to Hispanic riders. ","We also maintained our long-running leadership among U.S. core customers, those being Caucasian men over the age of 34, selling more than 6 in 10 motorcycles in the heavyweight category. And when it comes to new customers, more than 1\/3 of our U.S. dealers' new motorcycle sales in 2011 were to customers who were new to the Harley-Davidson brand, customers either buying their first motorcycle or those who previously owned a competitive bike. ","Turning to the markets outside the U.S. In the 15 country European market, more than 2\/3 of those who bought a new Harley-Davidson motorcycle in 2011 were first-time Harley buyers. And we gained a point of heavyweight market share strengthening our #2 position in this highly competitive market. In the Latin American region, for the first quarter of 2012, retail gains were led by Brazil where we are starting to see the results of our investments in that market, all to better focus on delivering a great customer experience. ","Last month, I and several of the team, we were in Manaus Brazil for the dedication of our relocated CKD assembly operations and then attended the grand opening of a new dealership in S\u00e3o Paulo. There were more than 1,000 people at the dealership party and I'll tell you the buzz and the enthusiasm were just simply incredible. ","We continue to make gains in the Asia-Pacific region as well with first quarter new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales up more than 25% from the year-ago period. And we're very pleased to see double-digit growth in Japan as they recover from last year's tragic events. We also saw a very strong growth in Asia-Pacific's emerging markets including both India and China where retail sales doubled in each of those areas during the quarter compared to last year. ","So all in all, it's great to see our strategy come to life. In spite of all the good stuff I just spoke about, the most encouraging part is that I believe the best is yet to come. We believe there are many growth opportunities. In international markets, we believe we have barely half the potential. In the U.S., while we are proud of our market share gains in recent years, we believe there's a lot of room yet to run on the industry's road to the recovery. Industry volumes last year were about half of their pre-recession peak and the industry is still working through the excess of used bikes. ","Harley-Davidson is growing outreach faster than core and we expect to further broaden the reach of our products in markets everywhere through these remarkable new motorcycles. When I look at all the exciting products that are in the development pipeline, seeing the results of our changes in the manufacturing and look at all the great things to come through our focus on retail excellence, I believe the opportunities for this company and this brand are tremendous. ","And all of us at Harley are working harder than ever to realize these opportunities. So, thank you again for being on the call. Thanks for your continued interest in Harley-Davidson. And now let me turn it over to John Olin.","John A. Olin","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results for the first quarter starting on Slide 11. ","During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was up 16.7% behind the 19.4% increase in shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Our first quarter income from continuing operations improved to $172 million, an increase of $52.8 million. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rose to $0.74 per share, up from $0.51 a share in the year-ago quarter, a 45.1% increase. Operating income from the motorcycle business was $208.1 million, up $83 million or 66.4% compared to last year's first quarter. ","The strong increase in the motorcycle business was driven by increased motorcycle shipments, higher gross margin and favorable restructuring spending as compared to last year, partially offset by higher SG&A. ","Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was strong during the quarter, but down slightly compared to last year's first quarter when HDFS's results were favorably impacted by a retail credit loss release of $12.7 million. We're off to a great start this year, delivering strong results as we make progress against our growth strategies and the transformation of our business. ","Now let's take a look at retail sales on Slide 12. Overall, worldwide retail sales of new Harley -- of new motorcycles were up over 20% in the first quarter. This represents 11 consecutive quarters of largely improving results as we continue to invest in sustainable growth opportunities around the world. The growth trend in retail sales reflects the strong global brand and product appeal as well as the worldwide dealer efforts Keith just mentioned. ","Moving on to Slide 13. Retail sales in the U.S. exceeded our expectations. During the quarter, sales in the U.S. were up 25.5% supported by momentum from the strong affinity for the Harley-Davidson brand, appealing 2012 motorcycles and improving macroeconomic conditions. Also, we believe the unusually mild weather in the first quarter, including the warmest March in 50 years, encouraged early sales to some customers who may have otherwise purchased later in the spring season. ","U.S. market share strengthened by 4 percentage points to 57.4% in the first quarter versus prior year. As a result of stronger-than-expected first quarter 2012 retail sales, U.S. retail inventory at the end of the first quarter was down approximately 4,400 units compared to last year. U.S. retail inventory was at its lowest level in many years and we expect retail inventory will remain tight over the next couple of quarters. On a sequential basis, retail inventory during the quarter was up about 1,500 units from the end of last year as dealers prepared for spring. ","On Slide 14, you'll see retail sales in international markets for the quarter grew 11.2%, driven by strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. During the first quarter, Latin America was up 85%, driven by strong performance in Brazil as the dealer network continues to gain momentum compared to last year's first quarter when we were starting the process of building a new dealer network. Retail sales in Mexico were also strong during the quarter. Retail sales in Asia-Pacific region were up 25.4%, driven by strong growth across the entire region. Canada was up 1.5% in the quarter and the EMEA region was down 1.1% for the quarter compared to 2011. ","We saw year-over-year growth in some major European countries including Germany, France and Switzerland and emerging markets. But that growth was offset by declines in southern Europe and the U.K. Despite challenging retail conditions in Europe, market share continued to strengthen and through February  was 13.5%, up 1.4 percentage points. ","As we have discussed, international expansion is one of our core areas of investment in future growth. It's our objective to open 100 to 150 new international dealerships between 2009 in 2014. Since 2009, 67 incremental international dealerships have been opened with roughly 2\/3 in emerging markets. ","On Slide 15, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were up 19.4% compared to last year, and 1,300 units above the high end of our expected shipment guidance range as a result of higher-than-expected retail sales. The year-over-year increase in shipments was also aided by 6 additional days included in this year's Q1 fiscal quarter versus last year's. The fourth quarter of this year will include 5 fewer days than last year's. This adjustment is required every several years to sync up our fiscal calendar with the regular calendar. ","During the first quarter, Touring as a percent of total shipments, was up versus prior year and all categories were within their historical mix ranges. As of the end of the quarter, we continue to hold a higher-than-normal level of motorcycles in our company inventory to support shipments during the ERP implementation. ","On Slide 16, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycle and Related Products segment was up 19.8% in the first quarter behind strong growth from all our businesses. Motorcycle revenue was up 19.5%, behind a 19.4% increase in shipments during the first quarter. Parts and Accessories sales were up 21.1% and General Merchandise was 19.2% in the quarter driven by improved product availability, strong international sales and improved worldwide retail motorcycle sales. ","On Slide 17, we have laid out the expected restructuring activities along with the impact of resulting temporary inefficiencies. This slide is intended to provide a clear view of our restructuring activities, the cadence and the impact as we head into the final innings of the restructuring plan. ","As we have discussed, we're in the process of exiting our Australian wheel manufacturing operation. We are also implementing our new 7-year labor agreement and continuous improvement system at Kansas City and in Wisconsin. Also, during the quarter, we completed the consolidation of our General Merchandise and parts and accessories distribution with a third party logistics partner. ","During the last call, we stated that we expected to launch our ERP implementation at York in the second quarter. We also stated that a quality launch was our top priority and that we would not launch unless we were absolutely ready. During our extensive systems test, we uncovered opportunities to further improve the design of the system and further reduce the expected downtime during launch. As a result of these learnings, we have decided to adjust the timing of the launch and now plan to launch the system in early July. ","While we are anxious to complete the implementation, the new learnings and the adjusted timing provide some benefits. First, the July launch allows us to continue to produce motorcycles without the ERP production disruption during the height of the spring selling season. This is particularly attractive given the very strong first quarter retail sales. Second, the July launch is expected to slightly reduce production downtime and given the improved solution has increased our confidence in a smooth implementation with less risk. And, finally, the July implementation allows us to sync up the ERP systems launch with the start of the 2013 model year motorcycle production, which provides for a more efficient use of the normal transition period to the new model year. ","As a result of the adjusted timing of the ERP, we will reallocate approximately $10 million of total expected capital to support restructuring. However, this does not change our full-year restructuring timing, cost or savings expectations. ","We experienced approximately $7 million in temporary inefficiencies during the quarter and continue to expect temporary inefficiencies in 2012 to be generally in line with 2011 which were $32 million. The expected ranges for the remaining quarters are noted on the slide. Year-over-year production in the third quarter will now be negatively impacted by the ERP implementation downtime. We also expect production to be lower in Q4 than prior year due to our ability to flex production in York in the first half of 2013. ","Turning to restructuring costs and savings on Slide 18. We experienced $11.5 million in restructuring expenses during the quarter and continue to expect to spend $50 million to $60 million for the full-year. We also continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $315 million and $335 million upon completion of our restructuring activities. ","On Slide 19, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 35.9%, which was 2.8 percentage points higher than last year. Manufacturing benefited from restructuring savings and incremental margin on higher production and foreign exchange benefited gross margin by $11 million driven by favorable hedge positions. Raw materials were negatively impacted by rising fuel and a slight increase in steel costs. ","On Slide 20, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 16.3%, up 4.5 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. Operating margin was favorably impacted by higher gross margin and favorable restructuring, partially offset by higher SG&A. SG&A was up roughly $33 million or 16.3% higher during the quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 6 extra days included in this year's first quarter compared to last year's fiscal calendar.  Conversely, the fourth quarter of this year will have 5 fewer days compared to last year's fourth quarter and therefore, we expect Q4 SG&A to be favorable compared to last year. ","This quarter's SG&A increase was also a result of investment in our growth initiatives and timing of spend within the year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 18.6% versus 19.2% in the same quarter last year. We continue to expect SG&A spending will increase on a year-over-year basis as we invest in growth, but will decrease as a percent of revenue through 2014. ","Now, moving onto our Financial Services segment on Slide 21. HDFS operating profit decreased $0.5 million or 0.8% compared to last year's first quarter. The key drivers of the first quarter results were net interest was up $1.3 million due to favorable borrowing costs partially offset by lower revenues as our book of retail loans continues to shrink, reflecting lower motorcycle sales during the downturn. Second, the provision for retail credit losses was $6.6 million higher in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to a $12.7 million 2011 credit loss reserve release versus a $2 million 2012 release, partially offset by lower credit losses. And finally, the provision for wholesale credit losses was $1.9 million lower in the first quarter of 2012 and operating expenses were $1.7 million lower than the same period last year.  ","We're very pleased with the performance of the business and believe HDFS provides a competitive advantage for sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products.  Now, Larry provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 22. Larry?","Lawrence G. Hund","Thanks, John, and good morning. During the first quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 22.1%, or $100 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher new motorcycle loan originations partially offset by a 0.4 percentage point decrease in retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycle financing. Additionally, used motorcycle loan originations increased during the quarter. Total finance receivables outstanding decreased 3% compared to a year ago, as runoff of older retail loans exceeded new originations.","HDFS has focused on prudently increasing credit application approval rates for near prime and subprime customers over the last several quarters. The objective is to use our analytics from 20 years of motorcycle lending to approve more credit applications in well-structured loans. Our goal is to have a portfolio that continues to perform well over time and delivers an appropriate return on equity. We are very pleased with the improved retail delinquency rate and retail credit losses compared to last year, which you will see on Slide 23. ","The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the first quarter 2012 was 2.56% or 112 basis points better than the same date last year. Annualized retail credit losses improved by 58 basis points to 1% for the first quarter compared to last year, primarily driven by our continued strong underwriting, collection and loss mitigation efforts, as well as improving consumer credit behavior and macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. ","While we [Audio Gap] disciplined in how we manage the loan portfolio and the overall business, we have no assurance that current consumer behavior will continue. At some point, shifting consumer behavior may temper the strong credit performance we have experienced. We are pleased with the continued progress at HDFS. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc. ","Now, I'll turn it back to John.","Keith E. Wandell","Thanks, Larry. Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 24. You will see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, HDFS completed a $400 million medium-term note issuance at a rate of 2.7% and we contributed $200 million to our qualified pension plans. Also, as we noted on the last call, HDFS paid a $225 million dividend to Harley-Davidson Inc. ","In addition, HDFS had $1.1 billion of available liquidity through bank, credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity, these in cash and\/or credit facilities. During the first quarter, we increased the quarterly dividend of $0.125 a share to $0.155 a share, a 24% increase. In addition, we repurchased approximately 254,000 shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $11.3 million during the quarter. ","Our first quarter repurchase activity was lower than we had planned. Due to uncertainty around the timing of our ERP launch, we believe that it was prudent to suspend share repurchase activity until we determine the new launch timing and communicated the plan to all stakeholders. We anticipate reinitiating share repurchase activity during the second quarter. ","As we have stated, returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders. ","Now, I'll review the remaining HDFS, Inc. Financials on Slide 25. I would like to highlight one item on this slide. With regards to continuing operations, the company used operating cash of $74 million during the first quarter, compared to $105 million used in 2011. The Motorcycle business generated operating cash of $21 million during the first quarter, even after a $200 million contribution to our pension plans. ","On Slide 26, you'll see that for 2012, we now expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments to be between 245,000 and 250,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up 5% to 7% from 2011 compared to prior guidance of up 3% to 5%. Our revised full year 2012 shipment estimate takes into account slightly improved capacity at York and increased production at Kansas City. ","We continue to be committed to aggressively managing supply of new motorcycles in line with demand. In the U.S., we expect our dealers to retail more units than we ship in 2012, thereby lowering year end retail inventories in the U.S. given our flexible manufacturing capability, which we expect will be online in the first half of next year. ","During the second quarter, we expect to ship between 79,000 and 84,000 units. In anticipation of the planned ERP launch and our 2013 model year cut over in July, we will significantly draw down company-owned inventory in the second quarter. In fact, production will actually be slightly lower in Q2 than in Q1 due to fewer production days. ","We continue to expect full-year 2012 gross margin will be between 34 3\/4% to 35 3\/4% percent. We expect gross margin will be positively impacted by incremental restructuring savings, increased productivity from everyday continuous improvement and the 2012 model year pricing announced in July of 2011. We believe that raw materials surcharge and temporary inefficiencies from our restructuring activities will be comparable to 2011 levels. We expect currency to be a headwind in 2012 and now expected product mix will be slightly unfavorable for the full-year. ","Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which now includes approximately $35 million of capital related to restructuring. ","As we look back on the first quarter of 2012, we are very pleased to deliver strong results and progress on many fronts. Worldwide retail sales were extremely strong, driven by sales in the U.S. and regained market share in key markets. An increasing number of diverse customers are being drawn to Harley-Davidson [Audio Gap]. ","We increased our 2012 shipment guidance and our quarterly dividend was increased by 24% while we continue to repurchase shares. We continue to make progress toward our transformation to a world-class manufacturing and product development and the entire organization has sharpened its focus on continuous improvement across all areas of our business. We remain focused on executing against our strategies as we complete the final activities in our manufacturing restructuring. We continue to transform our organization and grow our business while delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. ","And now, let's open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the industry is still working off used inventory and I was hoping you could maybe just give us some color on where you are with your used situation versus your competitors. Because it does seem like your used inventory has really dried up, and I'm wondering if you having a cleaner inventory mix out there might have driven some of the market share gain in the quarter. So, I was hoping you could also maybe comment on how your used growth compares to your new bike growth for Q1.","Keith E. Wandell","When we look at Harley-Davidson in particular, in the quarter, we saw basically pricing flat or stable versus prior year and we also saw that in the fourth quarter. So we saw a lot of gains prior to that, probably 4 or 5 straight quarters and a much more flat performance in the fourth quarter and the first quarter here. When we look at overall used bike sales or kind of the growth between used and new, we did see -- would look to be an inflection point in the fourth quarter of last year where we saw, actually, new start to exceed the growth of used. And in the fourth quarter, new was up about 12% and used was up by just shy of 6%. Last year total demand for new and used was up 81.1%. And as we look in the first 2 months of this year, our data is on a month lag, so through February, total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles was up 22.5%. With new slightly exceeding the used growth rate, so we're pretty pleased with that and the used to new ratio was flat on a year-over-year basis.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up and then I'll pass it on. But the change in the timing of the ERP roll out, did that affect how many bikes you kind of prebuilt in the first quarter versus what you might have expected to prebuild previously?","Keith E. Wandell","Not the changing of the ERP. In the first quarter, let's kind of take a step back in the conference call. We talked about we entered the quarter with 7,000 excess units. And at that time, we had intended to build our company-owned inventory in anticipation of the ERP launch and we also expected to build retail inventories a little bit. Moving the ERP launch did not have any impact but as we dialed forward 3 months, what we did see is that we were able to maintain the excess inventory that we had built in the fourth quarter of 2011. We still have approximately 7,000 units of excess inventory. However, our company inventory fell by 4,400 units but the movement of the ERP did not affect that. What it does affect is our ability to continue to produce throughout the second quarter in the height of the selling season, so as we looked at inventories while they're down coming into it, we have the excess inventory that we would expect to release in the quarter and feel that pretty much for the second quarter we'll be at year ago inventory levels.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I had a couple of questions on cadence. I think, John, you mentioned that shipments would be down in the fourth quarter year-over-year as you prepare for surge capacity in 2013. So does that still imply that you expect shipments to be positive in the third quarter with ERP? And then just secondarily on gross margin, should we assume peak gross margins then in the second quarter as well given the shipments to cadence in the second quarter?","John A. Olin","Okay, Sharon. So, kind of let's talk about the cadence driven by the ERP move. So, we had first anticipated that production would fall in the second quarter as we implemented the ERP system. Now we'll move that to July and so we would expect production to kind of continue throughout the second quarter. But that production will be down a little bit in the second quarter versus the first quarter. What we've done now is push that kind of the production out, the production reduction to July. And in doing that, we're also syncing it up with our model year 2013 product. So, when we look at the second quarter, we will have very healthy shipments into the trade. We're looking to ship in 79,000 to 84,000 units which well exceeds our year ago second quarter which was 64,000 and a lot of that is coming from inventory. So as we proceed through the second quarter, which we're starting out at very low levels of inventory, we'll ship in the vast majority of the excess 7,000 units and we'll ship out most all of the remaining 2012 product prior to July. The reason being is that, we have the new model year coming right behind ERP launch, so what we want to do is get that out into the trade. Now, the nice thing about moving the ERP system back is this is a time when dealers are typically used to having inventories that run low in anticipation of the new model year. So we've got -- we have pretty strong production in the first quarter, will be slightly down in the second quarter, it will be down in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, down in the third quarter because of the ERP launch and in the fourth quarter, because of the ability to surge up capacity at York in the first half of 2013.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then on gross margins?","John A. Olin","Your question on gross margin was we would expect gross margin to be better in the second quarter than the third quarter because of the shift in the production. When you look quarter-over-quarter, production is down slightly from first quarter to second quarter, so gross margin would probably be pretty much in line with what we saw in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, what's the motivation to further de-stock your dealers? Is it to drive up residual values of your used bikes and if so, are you seeing the trade-in customer come back now that his bike is worth a little bit more?","John A. Olin","Craig, we are not motivated to further de-stock the retail trade. It certainly went down in the second quarter because of the very high retail sales in the first quarter and actually that's why we shipped a little bit over our first quarter guidance. That volume came from the fact that we're expecting to put more in inventory in anticipation of the ERP. We shipped that instead.  As we said last year, we felt that as we looked at the end of the quarters 1, 2 and 3, inventories were lower than we would like on an ongoing basis and in the first quarter, we stated we like to increase inventories a bit. That was just the strong retail sales that brought retail inventories down. We do expect to have inventories tight but it is not our expectation to further de-stock the trade in the United States.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just to be clear, on a full-year basis, you think retail and wholesale in the U.S. will be close to 1-1?","John A. Olin","No. We will retail more than we ship. But that will happen in the fourth quarter as we get ready for the surge and our capability for flexible manufacturing in the first half of next year.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just on the international side if I may, you're at 67 dealers, your plan was 100 to 150 over a period of time. How many more do you think you can do in 2012? And do you ultimately think you'll be closer to that 100 or that 150 number?","Keith E. Wandell","Craig, at this point, we're just providing guidance that will be between about 100-150. We're right on plan with what we set up a couple of years ago. And we're putting up dealers every quarter but we feel great about where we're at.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First of all, John, any color you can give us on the level of overtime that you've worked in the first quarter? And then, would that -- I would anticipate that that would continue in the second quarter versus what you would view as a normalized rate?","John A. Olin","We were working overtime in the first quarter. What I would characterize it was would be not full out, but we were working a fair amount of overtime. We don't believe that that's sustainable for long periods of times. We will expect to work a little bit of overtime in the second quarter as well.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Any quantification on that that you can give us, John, just a sort of on an ongoing basis to look at it? What -- was it kind of more of a normal rate, or how much it cost you, so to speak?","John A. Olin","No. Again, it was a moderate amount of overtime and we don't expect to do that on an ongoing basis but given the tight inventories, we're able to work it. Beyond that, not really prepared to give much more, Tim.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then back to this growing gap or below where you have the -- where you would desire the U.S. channel inventories. As you alluded to earlier, you entered 2011 saying, hey we're a little bit below our ideal levels. We want to have shipments exceed retail on '11. Well, that didn't happen because of the stronger retail. The same thing you wanted to do this year, as you've already said, well, that's not going to happen now given the strength of retail. Any quantification or guidance as to where -- are you 5,000 units or so under where you ideally would like to be, whatever the base level is in the U.S. channel?","John A. Olin","Well I think overall, we're going to continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. So a year ago, we felt we were a little bit light and we wanted to put some more in. And, I would say a moderate amount. We're going to continue to be very prudent in what we put in the trade. But last year, it was low. Now, in the first quarter, we're 4,400 lower than we were at that point. So we would expect a fair amount to be put in.  I did not say that we felt we would be done on the year. I did say that we would be tight for the remainder of the year. When we look at the second quarter which is the height of our selling season, we do have the 7,000 excess inventory. We would expect to put it into the trade in the second quarter. And I would expect most of the second quarter to be in line with year ago inventories and as we end the quarter, the second quarter, I would expect retail inventories to be higher as we ship out everything and the cadence of the timing of our model year launch is pushed back a couple of month or a couple of weeks this year. So I think we'll end the second quarter with higher inventories and that will ready us for the ERP launch and the model year switch over.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and so being down, retailing more than shipped, that was within a fourth quarter comment?","John A. Olin","Yes, on a full-year basis, because of the inventory, the retail inventories that we'll take down in the fourth quarter, we would expect to have our dealers retail more than we ship. That is in the fourth quarter where we don't have the pressure on sales and we'll have the fire power coming out of York given our new search capability to make the units closer to customer demand.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then lastly, any type of pickup rate once you get everything implemented here? What type pick up rate that you could see on incremental sales on a go-forward basis once we see everything implemented here, say by the end of '12? Pickup rate to the operating margin, gross margin, however you want to characterize it.","John A. Olin","Well, look on the -- the Slide 12, I believe, is we would expect additional restructuring savings coming in. We're expecting restructuring savings of $58 million to $78 million incremental this year and then another $20-or so million next year. So we would expect those savings to come in according to plan as well as our spending on restructuring which is $50 million to $60 million this year, dropping off in 2013. So that should both widen gross margins as well as operating margins.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering, just a couple of questions still on the inventory and production and sales. At what point do you believe inventories would actually start to constrain sales or market share? And then on the production, you've produced above the high end of your expected range this quarter. Can you just kind of give us what some of the gating factors would be that would allow you to get more units out over the next couple of quarters? Is there potential to get more out if the ERP implementation goes as planned? And just lastly on the production, you've mentioned before that you won't have full flex capacity throughout the network until 2014. Can you give us a sense of where your network's capacity will be at in 2013?","Keith E. Wandell","Can you repeat the first question?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, the first question was just when does the inventory situation start to constrain sales? Are you getting close to that point or are you still far away from it?","John A. Olin","Rod, we are -- the inventories are tight and customers coming in at this time may have to wait for a particular color or for a particular model our dealers are trading out there. We do not think that it's costing us lost sales, but in some cases, it's delaying the sale to our customers, something that we don't want on an ongoing basis, but that's where it's at. So when you say constrained sales, I don't think that we're at that point. There is inventory in the system and the dealers are working diligently to get the customer the model and the color that they want. So overall, I don't think that we're in that area, but the customers are having to wait and we don't think that they're switching brands because of that wait. And again, we're working as diligently as we can to get more production and to meet that demand, which leads me to your second question is in terms of production.  We were able to exceed the guidance for the quarter, but that did not come necessarily from a lot of production, more production than we expected. We eked out a little bit more in York, but we're talking hundreds of units. Most of that came from -- we were expecting to build an excess and put it in inventory in anticipation of the ERP launch and instead, we shipped that out. So production is very tight. If the ERP implementation goes better than expectation, we could see a little bit of the capacity freed up at that time. And then, the next opportunity for production coming out of York is not until late in the fourth quarter. We do have capacity at Kansas City and as we raised our overall shipment guidance from 3% to 5% to 5% to 7%, the vast majority of that additional volume is coming out of Kansas City. So we are very constrained at York until the fourth quarter of this year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what's the trajectory of your capacity growth? We've -- you've talked about getting to your historical peak if you look out to 2014, but is it sort of the midpoint between that and where you are this year is what you would expect to be at for 2013?","John A. Olin","Well, in terms of capacity in 2013, the constraint is at York. And in the first half we'll be able to flex production so we will be able to meet the demand of what we have in sales in 2013 through the ability to flex our production at York. We're not concerned about production or capacity in 2013.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you -- there isn't really the limitation in 2013? You're going to be at your full flex capacity in that timeframe?","John A. Olin","Well, we are looking to surge at York only. We still have the other plants to do it. But right now, capacity, there's plenty of capacity at Kansas City. So again, we will have the capacity to meet the needs of 2013.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just last 2 things, are you still expecting this decline in HDFS. You had a $48 million decline in this releases expected, or are those expectations changing now given what you see happening in losses? And have you done any -- you're sort of modeling about just the overall weather impact maybe just by looking at the warmer states where whether is less of a factor?","Lawrence G. Hund","Rod, this is Larry. Let me take the HDFS question. I would say, we had a, as John talked about, a modest decrease in reserves here in the first quarter compared to last year. We have a very disciplined process we go through every quarter and we'll continue to evaluate that. Obviously, I think as we stated previously, we expect any reserve reductions this year to be significantly lower than the nearly $40 million that we realized last year.","Amy Giuffre","This is Amy. [Operator Instructions].","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just getting another question on your flex capacity, but more from an inventory perspective. As we think about your getting to that point where you can flex your capacity at York, just wondering on a going forward basis, how we should think about inventory levels. Obviously we can't look at history to help us model this so I was just wondering if you could give us any color because your manufacturing is going to be very different now.","John A. Olin","Yes, as far as overall inventory levels, it doesn't affect really company inventory too much. But what it does affect is really trade inventory levels in the fourth quarter. So, historically, Felicia, we would start building in October, on a level basis, and a trajectory and what we would do is put that inventory in the trade and our dealers would hold it until it was alleviated in the springtime. Now, what we'll be able to do is to bring those levels down and produce when the customer wants it. And we'll be able to start surging in the beginning of the next model year. And so we'll just produce closer to demand. So the biggest change in terms of retail inventory is less inventory in the field in the fourth quarter.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, yes, that was specifically what I was asking. And so, I mean, should we think about it as having just a slight cushion built upon what we would estimate for your production? Or is it as someone said before more one-to-one?","John A. Olin","We're going to ease into this capability, so we would expect the inventories to come down a little bit in the fourth quarter, not anything huge and we'll continue to work on it. We won't be fully capable until 2014 across all of our plants. But we would expect to step down inventory in the fourth quarter and produce closer to sales in the first half.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just a different question than what's been asked so far. You've been getting market share. It's been very nice and very impressive. Just give if you're seeing anything from your competitors that might skew the sustainability of these market share gains?","John A. Olin","Well, I don't think we would expect to hold on to a four-point game for the entire year. We're very pleased in what we see. We know that the brand appeal is very strong. We also know that the model year 2012 product is being very well received and the 103 engine is certainly working to close that value gap between new and used. So we're going to continue to work on our side of it and develop great products and the market shall take care of itself.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Latin America, other Asia, very big numbers there. Can you discuss maybe in a little bit more granularity the number of dealers that you have in those geographies now compared to say a year ago? And also, if you expect this kind of growth to continue or sort of moderate through the year?","John A. Olin","Well in terms of -- again, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in Asia Pacific, up 25% versus down on a year ago period, Japan is popping back after obviously the tragic events there. And then our growth in emerging markets, India and China, were up over double.  When we look at the overall dealership, the incremental dealerships, Gerrick, we put in probably 30 dealers last year on a year-over-year basis. 2\/3 of them are in emerging markets so they are in places like China and India, Indonesia and some in Latin America. Those, are not included, the ones in Brazil because those were replacement dealerships. So they are ending up in those areas, they're driving great growth, our emerging growth markets -- or emerging growth markets are growing at a much faster rate than the rest of Europe, easy for me to say so, and they are partially driven by the incremental dealerships.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted one clarification in terms of the decision to move the York, the SAP implementation at York. I mean, the 3 reasons you outlined seem highly logical. Was it just kind of opportunistic to do it at a better time? Or were there any other issues where you thought that maybe the preparedness wasn't where you needed it to be to do it in Q2 that also led to that decision? And then, I guess just on the back of that, in terms of Q3, can you help us think a little bit about how -- I mean you've said something already on it, but I think you were talking about one month that was going to be down 40% at York previously at the peak of the implementation, is that still the kind of production cadence we should be thinking about for Q3 now?","John A. Olin","Great, Patrick. With regards to the ERP launch,  no, it was driven by the testing that we were doing. We do all kinds of tests and one of the tests that we do is the shop floor test. And basically what we do is disconnect all the old systems, put the new system in and they are able to test that system along with the operational processes. And what we discovered is that in the parts and handling area, we had basically more complexity than we needed. And that complexity didn't come with the commensurate benefit. So as we said before, we are not launching this thing until absolutely ready. So we stepped back and took the time to change a few things in the design, which will take complexity out and therefore, de-risk it a little bit. And given that, we've pushed it back and then we talked about the 3 or so benefits that are associated with that, one being more confidence in our launch and less time to ramp it up. So we will reach that a little bit more on production coming out.  And that leads to your next question is in the third quarter, it's still in the 40% range. I mean, we're hoping to get a little bit more capacity out because we've got an improved solution, but we are still in the range of 40% of one month's production being down because of the ERP implementation.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","My question is surrounding the guidance. I think the similar question was asked coming out of the fourth quarter when 245,000 units was the high end of your guidance and the question was asked to the extent that you need to go above that, would you be able to -- does that represent the upper ceiling or could you get beyond that. And the answer at that time was that maybe, come the fourth quarter, once things are behind us, you could get above that 245,000. Fast forward to today, the upper end is 250,000 and at the same time, you've pushed back the SAP implementation. But ultimately, the same question, if retail is such that you're exceedingly low in terms of retail level inventories in the fourth quarter, is there still an opportunity to do some catch-up and is there still potentially some upside to that 250 based on how retail trends play out?","Keith E. Wandell","Yes, so let's talk about getting to the 250,000. So we boosted couple of percentage points of about 5,000 units. The vast majority of that is coming from Kansas City products. And we couldn't be more thrilled that the demand for those products, which are largely directed at outreach customers are doing very well and so we got strong demand. So we are taking the volume up, but the vast majority of it is coming from Kansas City. As I said we're eking out a little bit more production out of York. We do have more capacity in DC. So that's not an issue. And when we looked at York, we are running very tight and we'll continue to do so into the fourth quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, we do have some down days planned that we could run and we could generate capacity in the fourth quarter. The question at that time is, really looking at the overall trade because we'll have the capacity -- the capability to flex our production up even closer to when of those units are going to want to be consumed in the spring given our surge capability at York and we'll evaluate that at that time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of, I mean, the retail was so strong in the first quarter. I know you pulled forward some demand but I'm guessing that there's still some strength underlying fundamental strength. Any way to kind of break that out and quantify that at all?","John A. Olin","Well, we think it's clearly an extension of what we've been seeing on the improving retail sales trends. And it was largely driven by incredible feel for the brand. Again our share was up, we're up 25.5% in the U.S. and the industry was up 17.5%, that means all of our competition was up just over 8%. So a lot of it, it's been driven by again a strong brand. We talked about the new model year, the 103 engine is pulling a lot and then the improving underlying macroeconomic trends in the U.S. We do believe that some of it, to a lesser extent, was driven by the very favorable weather conditions and spring started a little bit early. We've done the analysis of looking at northern states versus southern states and we do see a slight improvement in growth rate in the northern states. I don't think it's anything huge, but there is a weather effect that we saw in the first quarter. And so, we would expect retail sales to moderate a little bit as we move into the spring selling season.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about HDFS and something related to the change in prime versus subprime versus the last couple of quarters you reported. But I also wanted to clarify your comments about the production that you're doing in advance and holding onto and not shipping because during the call, you said that you maintained that excess of 7,000 bikes in inventory. But then you also made a comment that company inventory fell by 4,400 units so I just wanted to clarify kind of which of those things -- just to get a sense of where that bikes built but not shipped stands cumulatively from both Q4 and Q1 at this point.  And then also just to sort of understand how, although you can hold those and ship them later, if you're doing that ahead of Q3 but your new model year starts in July, you'll be shipping old model year bikes after the new model year starts? Or you'll be delaying the new model year start? Just trying to understand how the bikes built in previous quarters can be held over once the new model year starts?","Keith E. Wandell","Robin, the 7,000 units we brought into the year, we held through the first quarter and we still have them. What I referred to is that retail inventory, the field inventory fell by 4,400 units. Our company inventory is still up. I also said that given the fact that we now moved the ERP to July and we synced that up with the model year 2013 new product launch that we will release those 7,000 prior to the third quarter, we will release them in the second quarter and that's what's driving some of our shipment in the second quarter so high is they're coming out of inventory. So in the U.S., we will ship as much as we can of model year 2012 product out in the second quarter versus the third quarter because when we cut the system over, we will begin making 2013 product and we want to get everything out so that the dealers can sell them down in anticipation of the new model year.","Lawrence G. Hund","And regarding the HDFS mix, I'd say what we saw this quarter was a slight shift towards more subprime in our mix. We have in previous quarters talked about it being 80% to 85% prime. This quarter was more around 80%. And 2 things going on there, the first is as we've talked about is our efforts to improve our analytical modeling to be able to approve more new prime and subprime customers and then we continue to see increasing competition in the prime lending space.","Keith E.
