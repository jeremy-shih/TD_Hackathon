All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note this event is being recorded. Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations for Kellogg Company. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference call.","Simon D. Burton - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining us for a review of our second quarter 2015 results. I am joined today by John Bryant, Chairman and CEO; Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Norman, President of Kellogg North America.","The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. As you're aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second side of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available via phone through Tuesday, August 11. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","And now I'll now turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better performance we saw in the U.S. Cereal business in the first quarter continued in the second quarter, and we again saw good performance across the international regions as well.","The benefits we have seen from our initial investment Project K have continued. And we expect it to continue to build momentum in the second half of the year. We're on track to meet our guidance for the full year. Specifically, we expect: approximately flat currency-neutral comparable sales; a decline in currency-neutral comparable operating profit of between 2% and 4%, including a negative impact of three to four points from rebasing of incentive compensation; and currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be between flat and down 2%, also impacted by compensation.","Our performance in 2015 represents a significant improvement from 2014. And we believe that we are building a foundation for better results in the future. As a result, our improving momentum and increasing visibility into productivity programs are driving our confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for sales and operating profit growth in 2016.","So with that in mind, I'd now like to talk about some of the things that give us that confidence. First, let's turn to Slide 4 and a discussion about momentum. Paul and the team have done a great job of improving the performance of our U.S. Cereal business this year. And while we definitely have more to do to improve category performance, we're confident that we're focusing our investment on the right drivers of sales growth to continue recent trends. We're improving our food. We've invested in our sales force. And we're improving the effectiveness of our brand building.","In addition, as you've seen in recent quarters, our international businesses have been performing well. Europe has seen some better results in a difficult environment, and growth has been good in Latin America and in Asia.","Secondly, our investment in Project K has helped to drive the improved momentum. It has provided us with the funds to invest in the Kashi organization and a significant number of new sales reps in both our warehouse and DSD sales forces in the U.S. and in our coverage of high-frequency stores, largely in emerging markets. These investments have already had an impact and will help to drive even better results next year.","Finally, we've made some significant structural changes to our business. Paul will bring his experience and knowledge to running the North American business. Also, we have recently hired Craig Bahner to run our Morning Foods business. And we've also hired Deanie Elsner, who was most recently CMO at Kraft Foods, to run our U.S. Snacks business. I believe that our management team is now the best we've had in years and represents the right mix of experienced industry professionals from outside the organization and talented long-term Kellogg employees.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide five shows the financial results for the second quarter. As you've likely seen, our reported results include a remeasurement of our Venezuelan business to the SIMADI rate of VEB 198 to the US$1. Venezuela is a volatile market and our circumstances changed in the second quarter. We experienced disruption in our business operations driven by reduced access to U.S. dollars for inputs to support production. As a result, we remeasured our business accordingly. The financial impact of this remeasurement is disclosed in detail in the appendices to our presentation materials.","Reported net sales declined by 5.1% due to the devaluation of international currencies. Currency-neutral comparable net sales were essentially flat, in line with our guidance for the full year. We saw strong broad-based growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. And in addition, our U.S. Frozen Foods business grew, as did our Canadian business. Reported quarterly operating profit was $412 million and included Project K execution costs and the impact of the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business.","Quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 6.8%, in line with our expectations. The decline was due to timing of manufacturing costs and higher distribution costs as well as the impact of resetting incentive compensation. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, $0.37 per share from the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business and other items that affect comparability, were $0.92 per share in the first quarter. These results include $0.05 of currency headwind as a result. Currency-neutral comparable earnings were $0.97 per share.","Slide six shows details regarding the second quarter sales growth. Comparable revenues for the quarter increased 0.1%, a slight improvement from the first quarter, and included a 0.5% increase in price\/mix, driven by our Latin America business. We saw good volume growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, driven by growth in Cereal. And several of our North American businesses grew volume as well. The slight decline of 0.4% is primarily due to Cereal in developed markets, but as Paul will discuss later, we are seeing improving trends in U.S. Cereal. Currencies lowered reported net sales by 5.5%, driven mostly by the euro, the peso, the Canadian dollar and the pound.","Slide seven shows our year-to-date currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Year-to-date gross margin was broadly in line with last year and with our guidance for the full year. While we have recognized lower material costs and we continue to generate strong productivity improvements across our supply chain, we are seeing higher inflation and distribution costs and, as I mentioned earlier, some timing on our manufacturing costs versus prior year.","In addition, we are investing in our food across the globe. Recall that we mentioned that some of the Project K-related savings would be invested in our food. This includes the renovation of Kashi and Special K as well as the launch of granolas and mueslis in a number of countries.","Slide eight shows the quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's operating profit decreased by 13%. This was the result of sales declines, increased distribution costs, timing of costs in our factories and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. We do expect results to improve as we progress through the balance of the year.","Europe's operating profit increased by 6% in the quarter, driven by broad-based improvement in cost of goods sold, including Project K savings, and the timing of brand-building investments, which are weighted more to the second half of the year. Quarterly operating profit increased by 9% in Latin America as a result of strong sales growth. This quarter's growth included a significant increase in investment in brand building.","Operating profit increased by 76% in the Asia-Pacific region. This is the result of double-digit sales growth in Asia and South Africa, lower cost of goods sold and comparisons to last year. In addition, the region saw some benefit due to the timing of brand building between the second quarter and the third quarter. The growth in operating profit also included continued investment in capabilities in the region.","Slide nine shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow, after capital expenditure, was $323 million. Cash flow in the second quarter was $311 million, which represented an improvement of more than $50 million from the second quarter of last year. We saw good performance in our core working capital, as I'll discuss in a minute. We continue to expect full-year cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our cash requirements for Project K are the highest in 2015 and this is impacting our year-to-date position, but we remain on track to meet our outlook for the year. And, of course, returning cash to shareowners remains a priority for us. In total, we've returned more than $2 billion to shareowners over the last two years through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 10 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. As you can see, our performance had flattened out over the past several years, but we've made a lot of progress improving our position recently and have best-in-class levels of working capital. We said that we would improve performance further to unlock cash flow after the acquisition of Pringles and to help us fund cash requirements for Project K. And our supplier-financing initiative has contributed significantly to this improvement.","Slide 11 details our currency-neutral comparable guidance for 2015, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect a relatively neutral balance between inflation and the combination of productivity improvements and Project K savings. We've seen slightly more cost come through our materials and distribution, but we have been able to manage the impact in our outlook. Our materials are more than 90% covered. As a result, we expect gross margin for the year to be flat to up slightly. We expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. We also still expect that currency-neutral comparable earnings will be between $3.74 and $3.82 per share, or in a range between flat and down 2%. Guidance for both operating profit and earnings per share include the impact of resetting incentive compensation.","The expectations for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week, the impact of the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business, and the impact of currency translation. Our expectation for the impact of foreign currency translation is now approximately $0.29 a share, up from the $0.24 per share we expected last quarter. This includes our estimate that the currency headwind from translating future 2015 earnings for our Venezuela business at the SIMADI rate will be approximately $0.10 per share. This will offset some improvement we've seen in other currencies. Our tax rate is still expected to be between 27% and 28%, and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million.","We continue to anticipate that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion, as I mentioned. And this includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K, partially offset by benefits from our supplier-financing initiative and other cash flow initiatives. Total capital spending should be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately one point of sales for incremental capital associated with Project K. And our current plan is that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares in 2015.","Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Costs for the integration of Pringles and Bisco Misr in Egypt are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share. Project K's pre-tax P&L costs are anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million, or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. And the impact of the remeasurement of Venezuela, in addition to the translation impact of $0.10 per share, is expected to be approximately $0.43 per share in total. A small amount of the remeasurement will impact our second half of the year. Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, and approximately two-thirds of this will come from cost of goods sold.","For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable earnings per share delivery, including the impact of foreign exchange, to be approximately evenly split across the next two quarters. Our foreign currency headwind is much greater in the third quarter, as currencies had already begun to devalue in the fourth quarter of last year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a discussion of our North America business.","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Thanks, Ron. Good morning, everyone. Let's first turn to the performance of the businesses within the North America segment. Let's start with the Morning Foods business. As you may have seen in public consumption data, the performance of the cereal category has improved this year. Total consumption across all channels was approximately flat in the second quarter, and, importantly, Kellogg branded sales were essentially flat, too, with our sixth largest cereal brands collectively growing sales and share in the quarter. This performance was driven, in part, by the good performance of the Special K brand, one of our main areas of focus over the last year. I'll talk more about this and Morning Foods in a minute.","Moving onto U.S. Snacks, we saw mixed results in the second quarter, with sales down 1.8%. Pringles grew nicely. Consumption trends in crackers and cookies improved, but we experienced continued weakness in wholesome snacks. In Crackers, our Cheez-It brand grew sales on a full point of share in the quarter. In fact, excluding Special K Cracker Chips, our total Cracker business grew sales and share. On Special K Cracker Chips, velocities are improving; however, prior losses of distribution continue to weigh heavily on our year-over-year performance. In Cookies, consumption and share trends also improved in the quarter, with our Fudge Shoppe, Sandies and Simply Made brands all showing consumption growth.","In both Crackers and Cookies, our innovation is weighted to the back half, with new items such as Cheez-It Extra Toasty, Town House Focaccia, Chips Deluxe Peanut Butter with M&Ms, and Simply Made Sandwich Cremes amongst the numerous launches coming to market now. Whilst Pringles, crackers and cookies all showed positive signs in Q2, wholesome snacks continued to underperform. Rice Krispies Treats and our base Nutri-Grain foods performed quite well; however, distribution losses on prior innovation have impacted our businesses this year. We are committed to improving the performance of U.S. Snacks, and this will be an area of focus for me in coming months.","Moving on to the Specialty Channels business, sales declined by approximately 1% in the second quarter, although our business improved as the quarter progressed. In the Convenience channel, we saw share growth in five of the seven categories in which we compete, although we did see some weakness in foodservice, partially due to the exit from some unprofitable business. We are confident that our Specialty Channels business will grow in the second half.","The final business is the North America Other segment. This is the combination of Frozen Foods, the Canadian, and the Kashi businesses. Frozen Foods posted currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, driven by strong results from the Eggo brand. Eggo Waffles saw momentum in consumption, increased share, increased base sales, and gains in penetration and buy rate. In addition, Eggo handheld Breakfast Sandwiches continue to do really well in their first year. And we also saw good sales growth in the Canadian business, as Cereal, Frozen Food, and Snacks all posted growth, with sales of Pringles up at a high teen rate. As expected, sales of the Kashi business declined in the second quarter, which led to a decline in total North America Other segment sales of about 1.3%. While sales were down, the trend improved as the team began to launch new products and reestablish distribution. I'll come back to Kashi in a minute.","And now over the next few slides, I'd like to focus on the U.S. Cereal business and some of the progress we've made. Let's start with Slide 15. Over the past nine months, we have made good progress on the agenda we set out and have seen a stabilization of our Kellogg's branded business. This is illustrated by our improving top-line performance and Kellogg's branded share being up year-to-date. Back at CAGNY, we spoke about four critical elements to returning Cereal to growth, as illustrated on this slide. These were: focusing on wellness; investing in our foods; engaging with consumers in new ways; and dialing up the fun and executing with impact.","Slide 16 focuses on the first of these, wellness in today's world. One of our biggest challenges has been to return the Special K brand to growth. We have moved the focus of the brand away from diet towards wellness. In the past few months, we have launched a new protein offering and introduced a gluten-free Special K. We've also launched taste to innovation by adding more berries to our largest variant, Special K Red Berries and we have improved our Special K Vanilla Almond food, too. We've introduced new packaging and new communication to support all of this. I'm pleased to say we have seen steady improvement in performance over the past few months, as you can see on this slide. In fact, consumption increased by 2.4% in the latest public data. We also have more news to come in August with the launch of new Special K Apple Cinnamon Harvest.","Now let's turn to Slide 17. Our other challenge has been Kashi. Whilst we have yet to see the kind of turnaround we've seen on Special K, we are seeing distribution losses subside and velocities begin to stabilize. The team is making good progress on renovation and innovation plans, and we expect to see the fruits of these efforts begin to come through in improving trends over the coming months and as we enter 2016. You can see on the slide some of the Kashi innovation we have launched recently or have coming soon, including overnight mueslis, granolas, gluten-free waffles, organic chewy granola seed bars, and Sprouted Grain and Sweet Potato Sunshine Organic Promise cereals. As you know, we've made a significant investment in the Kashi team and organization. And we believe we have the right structure in place. The team is focused on delivering on-trend food to holistics and we'll leverage the Kellogg Company's infrastructure to the degree that it helps them achieve that objective.","Earlier in the year, I also mentioned the launch of Kellogg's Origins, which you can see pictured on Slide 18. This is a range of cereals, granolas, and mueslis made with simple ingredients and designed to meet evolving consumer needs. The brand is now launched, and early acceptance has been good.","The second critical element to returning Cereal to growth is investing more in our food. Our work on Kashi, Special K, and Origins all demonstrate actions to invest more in our foods. You can see on Slide 19 that this year, we have also launched new and improved Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with lower sugar. And as we look forward, we will continue to renovate our core offerings to give consumers more of what they want in the way of nutritional benefits, such as protein, gluten-free choices and simpler ingredient lists.","We know consumers are looking for foods with simpler ingredients and work is well underway to answer that call. Already in North America, 75% of our cereals are made without artificial colors, and more than half are made without artificial flavors. Further, we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg's branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg's branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.","The cereal category is and always has been a repertoire category, offering health, taste and, importantly, fun, too. We believe getting this blend right is as important today as it has ever been. You can see on Slide 20 that keeping our category vibrant and on-trend also means bringing fun to life on pack and in-store in impactful ways. We have seen good results behind our Disney Frozen cereal this year and also strong in-market performance behind our in-pack Avengers promotion and event in April. Looking forward, we believe initiatives like these are just as important as what we do on the health and nutrition front to drive category engagement.","The final area I wanted to mention is in-store execution on Slide 21. With our dedicated sales force, including field sales reps, back in place, we are seeing tangible improvements come through in the area of assortment gains, in-stock performance and merchandising behind the initiatives I outlined earlier.","So in summary, on Slide 22, whilst we still have plenty to do, we are pleased with the progress we're making on our Cereal business behind better core brand performance, relevant innovation and renovation and better execution through the path to purchase. In fact, sales are on-trend to be flat to up in 2016, a great improvement.","Finally, I would like to thank the entire Morning Foods team, who have done an incredible job over the past year improving all parts of our plan.","With that, I'll turn you back to John.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul. Now let's turn to Slide 23 and detail regarding our European business. The Pringles business in Europe had another great quarter and delivered mid-single digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth on a difficult double-digit comparison last year. The business in the UK posted double-digit growth and share gains, partially as a result of increased distribution. In addition, the launch of Pringles Tortillas made an important contribution to sales, although only launched recently. We have a significant Pringles business in Germany as well and we saw high single-digit sales growth there as a result of distribution gains and increased commercial activity.","Consumption trends improved in our Wholesome Snacks business in the second quarter. We have restaged Special K Bars in the region, which is helping the brand's performance. This and the renovation of some of our foods, will continue to contribute and we expect the Wholesome Snack business to return to growth by the end of the year.","Total comparable net sales in the region decreased by 2.5% in the quarter, as the Cereal category continued to be a challenge. We restaged our Special K Cereals in July and had other activity launching at the same time. In addition, we're introducing new Special K Cereals on the Continent in the second half. We've introduced mueslis in Germany and are expanding the interaction to other parts of the region.","Slide 24 shows some detail regarding our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales in the region increased by 14.5% in the second quarter driven by growth in both Cereal and Snacks. Sales in the Cereal business were ahead of our expectations and included both volume growth and improvement in price\/mix. In addition, we gained category share across our key businesses and we increased investment in brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Specifically, we saw good growth in our portfolio of kids' cereals and a benefit from the parent brand products we've launched this year.","Sales in the Snack business increased at a high-single digit rate, largely driven by new products and go-to-market programs. In addition, underlying consumption growth in Pringles was good, all of which led to increased year-to-date share gains in the Mexican, Brazilian and Colombian businesses.","As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we executed the Copa Am\u00e9rica soccer-related initiative in the second quarter and it was a huge success. They had the highest customer engagement ever from a program in Latin America and has helped to drive the sales growth we saw in both Pringles and Cereal.","Also as we discussed last quarter, we have started investing in high-frequency stores in the region. This initiative is relatively new, but is already driving distribution gains and sales growth and we see significant opportunity for further gains as we expand our efforts. The team in Latin America has done a great job with new products, investing in growth and executing the plans. The results this quarter reflect all this effort.","Let's turn to Slide 25 and our Asia-Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable net sales in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to broad-based growth. The Indian business also grew at a double-digit rate of growth across brands, with some of our new packaging initiatives driving results. The business in Japan also grew at a double-digit rate due to the continued popularity of granolas and strong growth from All-Bran.","New advertising and innovation helped drive sales of the Special K brand up significantly in South Korea. We also saw good growth in Southeast Asia. The Pringles business also posted strong net sales growth in the quarter and consumption increased at a double-digit rate due to geographic expansion and the success of a music campaign similar to the one we run in Europe.","Sales declined in the Australian business, with a total quarterly sales growth for the region of 6.8%. While we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we have plans for improvement, which include new product introductions, support which stresses the nutritional benefits of our food and a focus on increasing distribution. The first half of the year has been strong for the Asia-Pacific segment and we expect that the team will continue to execute well over the remainder of the year.","Let's turn to the summary on page 26. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2015. And importantly, this performance represents progress over 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we're building momentum. We're seeing improvement in our U.S. Cereal business, improvement in our European business and good growth in both the Latin American and Asian businesses, and we're confident that this improvement will continue into 2016.","We've invested savings from Project K and have seen the benefits. This investment will continue to increase next year. We have a talented management team that will drive the results of the individual segments. We have a well-defined strategy that we are continuing to execute. And we're starting an aggressive zero-based budgeting program, which we expect will generate significant savings in addition to the savings flowing from Project K.","These two programs will allow us to invest in the business while also driving improvement in operating margin. All of this gives us confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for comparable sales and operating profit growth in 2016. We're planning an investment day in November. And we'll give you more detail then regarding our plans for next year. And with that, I'd like end by thanking our employees around the world for all their hard work.","Now I will open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can I ask, just in terms of the improvement in profitability in the second half, just to help me understand that a little better. It was obviously down quite a bit this quarter, I think 6.8%. Does that include roughly a 6% headwind from incentive comp that basically goes away from here on out because you started taking guidance down in the second half of last year? If we could just run through that, and then I have a follow-up.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Alexia. A couple of things on that, first of all, we do have an expectation that sales will improve over the second half of the year. We have seen improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter, and we expect that to improve as we go into the second half. We did have some incentive compensation headwind in the second quarter. It's a couple of points impact to operating profit. We do have some of that impact going into the third and fourth quarter as well, though, so that isn't the primary driver. Really it's the sales performance. And then from a productivity standpoint within cost of goods sold, we are seeing our savings ramp up a little bit as we go through the balance of the year. That will help both gross margin as well as operating profit performance.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then the North American operating profit trends, you're expecting to get back onto your long-term earnings growth algorithm in 2016. Does that mean that operating profit growth in North America should pull around very quickly here, certainly within the next two or three quarters?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. As I mentioned, we do expect improving trends in operating profit in the back half for North America. And as we move into 2016, as you'd expect, we do anticipate growth in North American operating profit.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very early in the year. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, everybody.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just following on that, this is, I guess, as early in the year that I can remember in quite some time where Kellogg kind of discussed at least preliminarily their view for the out year, in this case, 2016. So again, I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe what drives the timing of that, to be this early in the year to talk about next year. And I think, as you discussed earlier, it does require Morning Foods to certainly be more stable and really into sort of modest growth mode. So is this just really a thought around your confidence level of that happening kind of sooner than later? And really, what's driving that?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good question, Andrew. I think it's, as you say, very early in 2015 to give guidance for 2016. What we're essentially doing is letting investors know that we expect to be on our long-term top-line and operating profit growth goals for 2016. And the reason we're doing that, as you look at the performance in 2015, we believe that we're building momentum. It's a significant improvement from where we were in 2014. We expect that momentum to build into 2016. What's driving that momentum is the returns on our Project K investments. So whether that be: the globe category teams and rapidly transferring ideas around the world; the Kashi team and the stronger innovation pipeline we see coming from that business; investing back in in-store execution; feet on the street in our U.S. Cereal business; and the investments in our emerging market capabilities, such as high-frequency stores.","Also, we have excellent productivity programs into 2016. We have additional savings from Project K. We have our underlying continues improvement programs. And on top of that, we have the zero-based budgeting initiative. So while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2016, we wanted to give investors a sense as we go into 2016 we do expect to be back on our long-term goals. We could obviously halt for the third quarter call or the fourth quarter call to do that, but we've given a commitment to investors to get back on those goals as quickly as possible, and we wanted to get that out there that we see that happening in 2016.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning and thanks for the deep dive on North America. I just wanted ask, Paul, if we were to use the Special K extensions in snacks as a case study as to what you're trying to do with Special K, you've made some progress with Special K in cereal. It seems to be a little bit more slow to recover in the snack side. And you're talking about feet on the street investments there. Could you perhaps talk about what the issues are between execution, reformulation, or other with that side? Thanks.","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Hi, David. I'd say we've been a little ahead on some of the work we've been doing on cereal, and we have touched all parts of the brand. If you take Special K, where it plays in snacks on crackers, on the Special K Cracker Chips, we are seeing some improving velocity through the renovated foods we've put back in market. However, we're lapping some pretty significant distribution losses. So the biggest issue there is recapturing lost distribution to be able to get that part of the business back on trend.","As you go towards wholesome, we did do some renovation on our core bars earlier in the year. They're holding steady. We're just launching, as we speak, Special K Chewy Nut Bars, which is a step-change in food. And that's just entering the market, as we speak, mid-year. So we'll be watching that closely as we look forward on Special K.","So the work is coming. The innovation is there. The renovation is there. It's a little behind in Wholesome relative to where it was in the Cereal business.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","If I could just follow-up on that, just the reinvestments that were made in DSD, the feet on the street, I think that began last year. How is that reinvestment there or investment there progressed over the last couple of years, and if there's any sort of detail you can give us about how that's going? Thanks.","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","We did add some additional reps to the DSD system back, I think it was early last year. And we've had some impact from that. I think what we're seeing on the Morning Foods side of the business is even more impactful, where we've put the feet on the street back on the warehouse side. And as a proportion of the change, the impact to warehouse was much bigger than the impact we did to the DSD system.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, a question about the zero-based budgeting, if I recall correctly, where we left off last was that you were kind of watching and what was happening at perhaps at Kraft or some other companies, and we're going to kind of look at it closely. So I guess if you could talk about maybe what's changed in the last three months that, you know, caused you to think about, or caused you to go further down that path on zero-based budgeting. And then connected to that, will you consider any change in the way that you change incentive compensation related to it, just simply because it's, you know, it's such an investment for the employee base and it's a little bit long-term in terms of driving value? So those two things, what's changed in terms of adopting it and will it come with a change in the way you calculate or look at incentive comp?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Bryan. This is Ron. Hey, first, in terms of our zero-based budgeting initiative that John mentioned. Timing is absolutely right for us at this point in time. Remember a couple of years ago, we undertook Project K, big initiative for us, touching all parts of the globe. That project is progressing very well. It's on track at this point in time, both from an operational execution standpoint as well as the financial elements of the program.","Fact is we already ran some pilots on zero-based budgeting back in 2014, so we've learned from those pilots. We have determined now the application is right. We're going to begin in North America. And actually that gives us some support for confidence in growing profit in North America next year. So we'll roll it into North America end of 2015 and into 2016 and then cascade it across the globe after that. A little bit early for us to talk about savings estimates at this point in time, but it does give us more confidence, as I said, in our 2016 outlook.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And on the incentive compensation, I wouldn't see us changing our macro plan design, but I could see us working to ensure we incentivize the savings for the people who are driving that program.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess I was a little surprised in terms your gross margin outlook where you talked about inflation and productivity are now sort of neutral for the year. It sounds like there's some incremental cost rolling through the P&L. Can you give us a breakdown of what that is? And also, any incremental color you can add in terms of the magnitude of investment that you're absorbing in gross margin regards to the product quality and rejuvenation efforts there?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Jason. In terms of our outlook on our inputs, our productivity, and then input costs. There has been a little bit of a change. Remember when we started the year, we said that all up with the productivity savings, the input inflation and then Project K savings, we may be net a little bit deflationary. Well, as we've come through the front part of this year, we've encountered avian influenza. That is having an impact on our egg costs and that's relatively significant for us. So it's having an impact, particularly on our back half cost structure. So we're expecting it to be relatively neutral now. We do believe our gross margin will be flat, though, to up slightly.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","While it's difficult for us to tease out the additional costs of renovating our foods, certainly there are additional costs in this year from doing that, and there will be meaningful costs over the next couple of years from continually evolving and improving our foods. And we will fund those through a variety of productivity programs within the company to absorb those costs.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And one more, if I may. A question for you, Paul, in terms of North America cereal. Can give us a sense of how much capacity you've taken out of the cereal market in the U.S. and how much, from where you sit, you think has come out of the industry? And as we look at some of the scanner data, it is encouraging to see that the amount of volume that's being sold on promotion has been steadily eroding. Do you think that we're seeing more rational behavior in terms of discipline on promotion and price investment? And do you think there's any relation to the capacity reductions that have happened?","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Obviously, we did close a facility last year in Canada, so that came out of the Kellogg business. I can't talk to all the stuff that's going on with our competitors, but I know they're making moves as well. I think the marketplace is pretty rational at the moment. We're seeing a little bit of price realization. We're putting our money, as I said, back into our food. We're investing back into our core brands. We're renovating, innovating and trying to drive those sales fundamentals right through to the store. I think that's where we'll get the benefit. I don't think there's going to be a lot more heavy promotion, per se. I think the category dynamics are pretty good at the moment.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Vishal B. Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Vishal Patel in for Ken. I just had a question on the recent agreement with the union that you announced over the weekend. You're not reducing workforce as a result. Is that a fair statement?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Vishal, I think if you look at our cereal network, as Paul mentioned, we closed a fairly meaningful facility last year in London, Canada that reduced the size of our footprint in North America. The contract that was signed with the union I think is a very good contract. It enables us to be more cost competitive. It gives us operational flexibility going forward. So it has us holding the number of cereal plants we have today open, but we have flexibility within that to change the scheduling and the production of cereal based upon what we need to produce for the category.","Vishal B. Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thank you.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alexis N. Borden - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is Alexis Borden in for David this morning.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Hello.","Alexis N. Borden - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Question, so comparing Special K with Kashi, so basically you've been seeing Special K trends improve and the retail scanner data shows this, but when you look at Kashi, it's still struggling with double-digit sales declines. Can you maybe tell us what's going right in Special K and why it's being harder to turn around Kashi, how do you see that progressing?","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Okay. As I spoke through in the prepared notes, I think we were a little ahead on Special K again versus where we were on Kashi. We've innovated with on-trend food. We've reinvested in some of our core SKUs. We have migrated the positioning of the brand more to wellness from diet and we've invested and activated heavily. Kashi, we have a bit of a lag because we've had to do quite a lot of renovation to our foods, including GOLEAN, for example, which I'm pleased to say in Q3 2015 will now be Non-GMO Project certified. The rest of the portfolio will go that way in Q1 2016. So we've more or less got through the renovation phase of our work on Kashi.","We also moved to put a team back in place in Kashi back in California. That team now is fully functional and in place and we're beginning to see the benefits of the renovation and innovation work they've been doing coming through. So I think you'll see Kashi trends improving in the back half of this year into the beginning of next year. We are seeing distribution losses, which were a big driver of those declines, subside and velocity stabilizing. So I think the recipe or the ingredients are coming together for Kashi to start to get back into growth as we finish this year and move into next year. So I think you'll see sequential improvement from now on with Kashi.","Alexis N. Borden - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Just a follow up on the zero-based budgeting question that Bryan asked. My understanding is that Kellogg had done this benchmarking work in the past and found that like in North America ex the DSD costs, that SG&A and admin expenses were pretty much in line with its peers. Am I mistaken in that assumption? And so what did you find in that pilot last year? Did you find opportunities? And, if so, in what areas?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Rob, so when we look at benchmarking our SG&A costs, and let's set aside the advertising costs and other brand-building costs and just get to pure overhead, we do find that we tend the benchmark pretty well. But peers are moving on us as well. We believe there's opportunity by executing a zero-based budgeting initiative starting, as I said, in North America and then cascading it across the globe. So we see it as an opportunity for us to be more competitive and perhaps unlock some funds for reinvestment into the business or to drop to the bottom line.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So it's just a function of everyone else is cutting so you think the bar keeps getting higher, so to speak.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, again, we've run a couple of trials, some projects internally and we've found some savings. Some of that savings have been in areas that we would not have anticipated, such as non people-related overhead costs. And we're also going to apply the ZBB tools into the brand-building element as well, which we are finding significant efficiencies even this year, whether it be in agency fees, media buying, point-of-sale materials, all those sorts of elements as well.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, John.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is Mario Contreras on for Eric.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. I had a couple of questions on I guess a couple of the adjustments you had this quarter. First, on the VIE deconsolidation. Can you talk a little bit about what that business was and what led to that decision?","And then second, on the Venezuela currency adjustments. Obviously, that's been a pretty volatile economy for a good amount of time now. So can you just talk about what got worse this quarter that led you guys to make the decision to change that accounting?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So first on this variable interest entity, we recognized a gain due to deconsolidating this third-party business. This is a co-manufacturer that was making food for our U.S. Snacks business. It was consolidated into our results over the past several years based on the accounting rules. In this quarter, the business sold itself to a third-party, and that triggered a change in our accounting. If you look at our 10-Q, it's been disclosed in the past and you'll see it disclosed again, obviously, and the impact. It's a one-time non-cash item that we've excluded from our comparable results.","Now if we move on to Venezuela, our situation did change in the second quarter in Venezuela. As I've mentioned in the past, we buy a small amount of inputs from outside of Venezuela to manufacture product in the country. And we typically get access to U.S. dollars to be able to do that. In the first quarter, we got access to those U.S. dollars. In the second quarter, we had no access to U.S. dollars. And, in fact, the government has indicated that it is going to slow payments going forward. This created disruption to our business in the second quarter, so we reevaluated the matter. And we determined that the best rate for us to measure the business at was a SIMADI rate of 198 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, but we still remain a priority industry within Venezuela. We do expect to continue to manufacture and to serve our consumers. We have a good business there and we have a great team that's managing in a very difficult environment.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. On cereal, one of your top customers has spoken about, in general, you know, not promoting as often across food, maybe going back a little bit toward EDLP. And I guess that would lead to display space for promos in general reverting to a more normal level. And bear with me here, but I'm just wondering if this has benefited cereal in any way, because I think of cereal as a product that maybe relies on successful promotions to succeed. And if there is less competition for display space, right, if consumers are no longer seeing displays all over the board, but they're seeing sort of the legacy ones like cereal, has that helped the category at all or is it not really taking place in your mind?","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Thanks for the question, Ken. Obviously, I cannot talk about specific customers. If I focus on our Cereal business, I think what we're seeing is the good return on our focus on driving our core brands better, with better innovation promotions, renovation ideas, and really focusing through the path to purchase with impact for sales execution and that's driving display. If you look at the data from Nielsen, I don't think you're seeing a lot more display necessarily. We are getting more impact and quality merchandising because we're leveraging the scale of these events and bringing fun and news to the point of purchase. So I don't see any relation to the theory you put forward. I think we focus on delivering our business and executing and exciting consumers in every retail environment.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If I could add to that too, Ken, I think if you look beyond the U.S., we've seen the Canadian cereal category get a lot better as well. And we're also seeing improving category trends, although they're not quite where we'd like them to be in the UK and Australia as well. So I think you're seeing cereal get on a stronger footing in some these large cereal markets. And even on a global basis, we actually grew our cereal sales globally in the first quarter and in the second quarter.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, John. That's helpful.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Hayes with Nomura. Please go ahead.","David H. Hayes - Nomura International Plc","Hi, gentlemen. Thank you. I think this is for Paul, this question. Just in terms of this encouraging momentum on U.S. Cereal and obviously this impressive array of innovation, I guess if I was being concerned or nervous about the ongoing trend, the question would be can you give us some kind of indication of your confidence that there isn't any channel pipe fill from these innovations in these numbers?","And I guess, more importantly, in some ways the consumer pull-through or the consumer repeat purchasing, you've got $0.10 of people trying it because it's new and then you don't get it pulled through. If you can give us some kind of indication, ideally quantitatively, in terms of focus group feedback and repeat purchase information, just to sort of give us that feel that this is actually ongoing business rather than people trying and then we've got to wait to see what happens in the next six to 12 months in terms of pull-through. Thanks.","Paul Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America","Hi, David. Two points to probably go towards, one is the data I was quoting is consumption data, so it's actually purchased data, total category's flat. Our biggest six brands are growing consumption dollars and share, so this is being pulled through. This isn't us pushing into the market. We have no inventory issues within the U.S.","Special K is interesting because the brand was up. Base sales as the quarter progressed went into progression as well. So when you've got base movement off the shelf, this isn't purely incrementally driven through display and price promotion, it's actually good fundamentals coming through in terms of base consumption.","So we know that consumers want nothing more than more goodies in their food when it comes to red berries, and giving them more of what they want, we're seeing them buy more from the shelf importantly. So I think the underlying trends are positive. That's why I feel positive about the future. This isn't share rental or overly pushing the business. This is good consumer demand coming through.","David H. Hayes - Nomura International Plc","Okay. Thanks, Paul. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Matt.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Morning.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","John, just coming back around to the 2016 outlook, you gave us a number of factors that give you confidence in the achievability of those targets, and the willingness talk about them today. Just curious here what you see as the biggest challenges or areas of uncertainty or areas where you're pushing the employee base to work harder to make sure you actually do deliver on those targets. And, Ron, I know this essentially is sort of asking for guidance, but is there any incremental color you can give us on the phasing of Project K savings you're looking for next year, not necessarily an absolute, but maybe relative to what we're seeing this year?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If I answer your question first on 2016, I think the important thing to remember is we are building momentum. In 2014, a tough year for us, we're building momentum in 2015 and we see that continuing into 2016. You're seeing it with continued strong Pringles growth around the world. You're seeing it with the larger cereal businesses starting to perform better, particularly in the U.S. and Canada so far. You're seeing also very strong emerging market growth. We grew cereal double digits across Latin America and Asia. And so that's helping our results as well. And we're seeing these overall trends put us in a better position as we go into 2016.","So I think what really helps give visibility to 2016 is the excellent cost and productivity outlook that we have for 2016. Obviously, we'll have Project K savings come through. We'll have continuous improvement programs. And we'll have zero-based budgeting also start to help 2016. So clearly, I'd like to get the top-line growth in place, but even if the top-line growth is lower than we would like, we still have good productivity visibility for next year.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","And, Matt, in terms of Project K savings, recall our guidance for 2015 is that we expect savings in the range of $90 million to $100 million. And we're tracking in line with that. Remember we always said that are savings would ramp up as we went through the years. As we look at 2016, at this point in time, and it's early to provide guidance on Project K savings, but we expect savings to be north of $100 million.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co.

Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Fareed Khan, our Chief Financial Officer.","Slide number two shows our usual forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, February 14th. The call will also be available via webcast which will be archived for at least 90 days. As always, when referring to our results and outlooks we will be referring to them on a currency neutral adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. And now I'll turn it over to Steve and slide number three.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter came in as we had indicated, completing a very important year for Kellogg Company. We launched Deploy for Growth, a strategy that gives us very clear priorities and has resulted very quickly in tangible, often bold actions for pivoting us back to growth. Our portfolio is more shaped toward growth today. We acquired RX in late 2017 and in 2018 we expanded its distribution, doubled its small brand awareness and extended its product line. This is a new growth platform for us.","In early 2018, we increased our stakes in our West Africa operations, moving emerging markets up to almost 20% of our Company's sales. Emerging markets will be a growth driver for years to come and in 2018 we accelerated our organic growth in these markets to a high single digit rate.","We also invested heavily in our brand and capabilities in 2018. Our brand building investment was increased at a high single digit rate in 2018 and it was invested behind better commercial ideas at higher ROIs. We are not just spending. We are revitalizing brands and even launching some new ones. We also invested in capabilities from e-commerce and digital social marketing to new pack formats to execution in high-frequency stores. All of these are investments in building a long-term foundation for growth.","We are seeing progress in the forms of better net sales and consumption performance around the world. This wasn't easy and it wasn't inexpensive. As we've said before, the heaviest lifting, the heaviest investment is when you're trying to reverse a trend. For us this was a multiyear trend in declining organic net sales.","Take a look at slide number four. It is the delta between the prior years' sales declines and 2018 stabilization that offers the best indication of how this investment and portfolio shaping is working. Reversing a stubborn trend is incredibly difficult and has required altering our mindset, restructuring our organization, rewiring our processes, rethinking every brand and changing how we think about each channel and reorienting our supply chain. That's why swinging to even flat organic growth is such a good sign. And we're not done yet.","Our guidance for 2019 incorporates a plan to continue increasing our investments through the first half. This, on top of some unfavorable cost comparisons with last year, means operating profit will decline in the first half before returning to growth in the second half. This translates into flat operating profit for the year but it drives a solid return to organic net sales growth almost immediately.","Further down the P&L, while earnings per share will be down in 2019, they will be down because of lapping 2018's first half tax benefits and because of the accounting impact of weak financial markets last December, not because of anything related to our operating performance.","The reason we are willing to continue investing in this turnaround is because we are confident it's working. Slide number five summarizes how we're investing, particularly in the first half. First, we'll continue to reshape our portfolio in 2019. In West Africa, we'll leverage the competitive advantage that our Multipro distributor gives us, growing our presence in cereal, snacks and noodles. We will continue to invest in RX's expansion because it gives us a new growth platform that goes beyond the base bars and possibly even beyond the United States. We are also investing in new brands that fill in white space for us such as in the areas of natural foods and digestive health. We are in the process of divesting our cookies, fruit snacks, pie shells and ice cream cones businesses in order to help us focus resource. The outcome of all these actions is a more focused growth oriented portfolio.","Second, we will continue to revitalize brands in 2019. The brands shown on this page all generated improved or growing consumption and share in 2018 as we ramped up investment behind better ideas. This is true revitalization. Look what we've done with Pringles and its flavor stacking campaign in the US and its soccer campaign in Europe. Or with Cheez-It and Rice Krispies Treats both with innovation and single-serve offerings. Eggo now has a stronger premium offering. Kashi cereal is back in growth and Bear Naked has become the number one granola brand in the United States. And brands like Crunchy Nuts and Extra have been revitalized in Europe. Consumers are rediscovering the benefits of cereal brands like Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats. We've got even bigger plans for these and other brands in 2019.","And third, we will continue to enhance capabilities in 2019. We've invested in and improved our innovation capabilities and pipeline, and in 2019 we have our strongest innovation pipeline in years, much of which hit the shelves in January and are off to strong starts. We've also been investing as you know in new pack formats particularly around On the Go offerings that can meet a growing occasion for us and one that we still under-index in our categories.","Our e-commerce business is growing and we are developing capabilities to keep up with the growth and set us up for sustainable growth well into the future. We will continue to invest in all of these key strategic capabilities in 2019 because we know they can give us a leg-up in the marketplace. We even have changed our organizational structure to execute these capabilities better than ever. So the first half of 2019 will be a continuation of our investment phase and it will produce further improvement in organic net sales growth and consumption. We will come out of this investment phase with a streamlined and more growth oriented portfolio, a set of revitalized brands both power brands and challenger brands, a stronger innovation pipeline and more competitive capabilities for today's marketplace. By the second half of 2019, you'll start to see investment increases moderate and profit growth return to sustainable levels.","Let me now turn it over to Fareed to walk you through what all this means financially. Fareed?","Fareed Khan","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. Q4 results came in largely as we had indicated. We faced our toughest ex-DSD impact comps for the year on our top line and we continued to invest in brands and capabilities, not to mention continued temporary cost inefficiencies on our drive to expand On the Go pack formats and channels as we've discussed on previous calls.","Slide six reviews our net sales performance. Two acquisitions accounted for 6 points of growth for the year. These were Multipro, the West Africa distributor we consolidated in May, and RX, which we acquired in October of 2017. Both these businesses continued to grow sales at strong double digit rates right through Q4. And going forward, RX will be fully in our organic results and we will have four months of Multipro in the acquisition line before it too goes into organic results.","On an organic basis, our sales were off slightly for the quarter and flat for the full year. This is an important improvement from declines we've experienced in the last few years particularly when considering the absorption of a mechanical negative 1% impact from the DSD exit. Specifically, this is the SKU rationalization and the elimination of the price premium we used to charge for the DSD services. And keep in mind that there was no such -- while there was no such mechanical DSD impact in this year's Q4, we were comparing against strong ex-DSD impact growth performance in 2017's fourth quarter. In fact, as we've pointed out previously, we faced significantly tougher comps across our businesses in the second half than in the first half as we lapped last year's second half acceleration in frozen foods, European Pringles and ex-DSD US Snacks.","An element to point out within sales is our price\/mix. As you can see, it stabilized in Q4 as we got past the DSD impact and as we executed revenue growth management actions late in the quarter. This total price\/mix line should continue to gradually improve going forward. And finally on currency. After a net weakening of the US dollar in the first half, the dollar strengthened meaningfully in the second half, giving us a negative impact for the year.","Let's turn to our gross profit margins on slide number seven. Once again, we split our gross margin performance into three buckets because we think this is helpful for understanding and forecasting the various puts and takes. We will start with the biggest bucket on the slide, the year-on-year mechanical impacts. First, as discussed previously, the DSD impact has been running about negative 125 basis points before lapping during Q3. And second, the Multipro impact which started during Q2 was about negative 130 basis points to 140 basis points during each of its full quarters of Q3 and Q4. We've got another full quarter of Multipro impact coming in Q1 of this year and a partial quarter in Q2. So this bucket remains predictable and no surprises.","The next bucket is the growth related impact. As you recall, this is the bucket that became a meaningfully negative impact starting in Q2. Driving most of this year-on-year impact were two mix shifts that we've discussed with you previously. First, we saw accelerated growth in our emerging markets businesses, which don't yet have the scale of developed markets and therefore carry lower percent margins at this time.","Second is the mix shift toward channels and pack formats, especially On the Go pack formats that we aggressively expanded in 2018 despite extra costs and distribution inefficiencies that this created. Right through Q4, we saw the benefits of this expansion in the form of new distribution, in-store placement that drives acceleration and On the Go consumption growth and in the second half significantly outpacing our snacks categories. This is a new platform for us for growth. This growth related bucket will gradually stabilize over the course of 2019.","The mix shift toward emerging markets will persist and that's fine. This growth is not cannibalizing any of our other businesses, and as we grow scale and shift our mix toward more value-added products, we'll improve our emerging markets margins over time. For On the Go and other pack formats, we are already working on reducing inefficiencies and incremental costs. We are adjusting our lineup of SKUs and we are working with co-packers to establish centralized packing centers and we are bringing some of our co-pack volume in-house, but this will take some time.","Lastly but very importantly is our bucket of ongoing input costs net of productivity. Throughout the year, our productivity and Project K savings as well as very effective commodity hedges were able to offset the margin impact of higher transportation, packaging and other costs. Looking ahead, cost per freight, packaging and various inputs are projected to remain inflationary, and with very favorable hedges now rolling off this inflation will be even higher for us in 2019 especially in the first half. We managed them well in 2018 and we've executed revenue growth management actions in several countries to help cover it as we progress through 2019.","Let's turn to slide eight to round out the rest of the P&L. Operating profit was up slightly in 2018 and down slightly in the fourth quarter because of the growth oriented cost that weighed on gross profit but also because of our increased investments in brands and capabilities. Starting in Q4 2017, we've used the elimination of declining ROI-DSD overhead to fund a ramp-up in brand building investment and investments in capabilities. Brand building alone increased at a high single digit rate in 2018, a sizable dollar investment that's already starting to revitalize key brands as Steve mentioned.","Earnings per share increased in 2018 thanks to US tax reform and some discrete one-time benefits, mainly in the first half of the year. Interest expense increased because of debt added to cover our additional stakes in West Africa. Other income declined because of our decision to mitigate future risk by reducing our pensions' expected rate of return. And shares outstanding came down modestly as we had mostly refrained from buybacks during Q1 through Q3 on the heels of our RX and West Africa acquisitions.","So in what was truly a year of investment, we grew net sales, operating profit and earnings per share in 2018. And even as we ran into some unexpected costs in the second half, we resisted the temptation to pull back on this investment because our priority was to improve our top line performance and because this investment was working.","We will conclude our discussion of 2018 by turning to cash flow on slide number nine. As we had often pointed out, our cash flow is extremely durable. It's held steady first through incremental cash outlays related to Project K and other productivity initiatives, and then in 2018 through increased cash outlays for growth initiatives, mainly in the areas of capacity and technology.","We also, you'll recall, made a voluntary cash contribution to our pension funds, increasing their funded levels. And we again improved our core working capital which came down by 50 basis points as a percentage of sales on good payables management. This durability and good working capital management is important as we ramp up capital expenditures further in 2019 around growth oriented investments and more on that in a moment.","So let's now turn our attention to 2019, starting with slide number 10. This is the slide we've shared with you on a couple of occasions because it's useful context for how we see our progression financially. In 2018, or really Q4 of 2017, we pivoted from a period of cost reduction focus to a focus on returning to sustainable growth. This requires an investment phase, spanning 2018 and into 2019, in which we shape our portfolio, revitalize our brands and develop and hone capabilities. We are building on a foundation that can produce sustainable profitable growth over time.","Slide 11 is yet another slide we shared at Day@K, only updated with some actual figures for 2018 and specific guidance for 2019. It too provides important context. This slide shows a gradual improvement in the balance between net sales and operating profit performance and we are right on track with this plan. As we told you back in November, we expect our organic basis net sales to improve further in 2019, moving into growth, while the increased investment will hold operating profit relatively flat again. As time goes on, our increases in investment moderate, as our top line sustains momentum, moving operating profit back into growth. In fact, this starts as early as the second half of this year.","Slide 12 gives you a lot more detail about how we are thinking about our 2019 outlook. It's important to reiterate that our outlook on all of these metrics does not reflect any potential divestiture. That sale process is well under way and we believe we could have a transaction completed sometime in the second quarter. However, until we know the transaction's true shape and size so to speak we won't offer guidance on P&L impacts or cash proceeds at this time. What I can tell is our plan for the proceeds remain to pay down debt for future acquisitions and\/or share buybacks. And of course, as with any carve-out of a business or businesses there will be some appropriate business alignment activity. We will keep you posted as the divestiture process progresses. For now, we will discuss our outlook with the assumption that we own these businesses all year.","Our net sales growth guidance includes a couple of points from the four incremental months of acquired sales of Multipro which we consolidated in May of last year. It also includes improved organic growth, up 1% to 2% year-on-year led by RX and emerging markets as well as improvements across our portfolio and regions. Recent revenue growth management actions should create a better balance between price\/mix and volume growth. Operating profit is flat because of the increased investment both in terms of increased advertising and overhead as well as costs related to our efforts to expand On the Go and other pack formats. The latter will become less of a profit impact as the year goes on as we discussed earlier.","Earnings per share will be down year-on-year because of lapping 2018's discrete tax benefits and because of a sharp decline in other income as pension income and other items are negatively affected by last year's downturn in the financial markets, especially in December. As a result, the other income line could be down as much as $60 million to $70 million year-on-year.","And we're looking for cash flow to remain even with last year, and this is despite an increase in capital expenditures we invest behind capacity and technology with an emphasis on growth plus the extra months of Multipro. Specifically, capital expenditure will increase by about $50 million year-on-year to roughly $600 million to $630 million range or roughly 4% to 5% of net sales. This is another example of investing now for sustaining growth over the long term.","We don't normally give quarterly guidance. But we are facing an unusual shape to our year in 2019 and we want to make sure you understand why. Slide 13 illustrates, without numbers, the basic shape of our likely quarterly phasing for operating profit in 2019 relative to what we saw in 2018. We don't anticipate any big differences in organic sales performance between the first half and the second half as heavier innovation calendar in the first half is balanced with Multipro being in organic sales in the second half. However, we do see two elements creating a lighter operating profit performance in the first half versus the second half: the timing of investment and the timing of cost pressures.","First, from an investment standpoint, we do have a heavier innovation launch plan in the first half of 2019 than we did in 2018, including new brands. So our brand building investment increase is much more in the first half as we support these launches. Additionally, many of the investments and capabilities that we launched in Q3 and Q4 of 2018 will continue into the first half of 2019.","And second, there are some timing differences in our costs. Our underlying cost inflation will be higher in 2019 as incremental Project K savings in COGS moderate this year and as we roll off some very favorable hedges. In addition, there's much more year-on-year pressure in the first half related to last year's favorability on savings in costs which even contributed to Q1 being by far our biggest profit growth quarter of the year in 2018. We have good productivity management programs in place this year and we've taken revenue growth management actions to improve price realization. But we don't expect to fully cover underlying cost inflation during the first half of the year.","And finally, there's a gradual ramp-up on margin improvement actions for our new pack formats as we've discussed. We have a lot of actions under way to reduce the near-term drag on margins on some of our new pack formats and channels including the On the Go items. As I mentioned earlier, some of these actions, many of which will take longer to put in place and probably won't start to have a positive impact until the second half.","One more thing to keep in mind, and it's not in our currency neutral guidance, but foreign currency translation is another factor you should consider in the phasing because based on where exchange rates are now you'd expect a much more negative impact on sales and profit in the first half than in the second half. So our net sales aren't back-weighted but our profit is because of how year-over-year comparisons on (ph) our investments, our costs and our margin improvement plans play out this year.","From an earnings standpoint -- from an earnings per share standpoint, there's one more timing factor and that's our effective tax rate comparisons that's depicted on slide number 14. We've talked about this before. In 2018, our underlying corporate rate reset lower thanks to US tax reform. That will translate into an ongoing rate for us of close to 21%. However, during 2018 we also realized some discrete tax benefits on top of the US tax reform reduction. Always difficult to predict their timing. Those benefits were particularly pronounced during Q1 and Q2, and this means lapping extremely low tax rates in the first half.","So putting it all together, the front-weighted investment and cost pressures and the year-on-year differences in tax rate in Q1 and Q2, we would expect to see a sharp double digit decrease in EPS in the first half with the first quarter down much more than the second. And then we will return to growth in both operating profit and EPS in the second half. So that's a detailed preview of how we see 2019 shaping up financially. It's another investment year, and it does have some timing elements that weigh down earnings early in the year but we like the foundation we are building and you'll see -- and you'll start to see more balanced P&L growth in the second half.","So with that, let me turn it back to Steve to walk you through our businesses.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, Fareed. One of the most important signs that Deploy for Growth is working is the fact that Group organic net sales performance in all four of our regions as shown on slide number 15. This means that the investments and changes we are making in reshaping our portfolio, revitalizing key brands and developing capabilities are taking place all over the globe and it's working.","It's clearly working in our international businesses. We returned to strong growth in Europe and in Latin America and we accelerated our organic growth in Asia-Pacific. We did this through a combination of stabilizing developed cereal markets, improving the growth of Pringles and expanding other snacks brands and products in tune with local cultures and tastes and more affordable pack formats.","As we build up our scale and portfolios in emerging markets, these regions become that much more important to our growth algorithm. And something we are very proud of -- and something we're very proud of are recent acquisitions in promising emerging markets businesses to complement our own. Witness the transformative impacts of our acquisitions in Egypt, our Parati acquisition in Brazil and our investments in West Africa.","Our investment and hard work is starting to take hold in North America too. We narrowed our decline in 2018 and very nearly got back to flat if you exclude the roughly 1.5 points of mechanical impact from our mid-2017 exit from DSD. We've got big brands back in growth, we've restored our innovation pipeline and we are reducing complexity through a reorganization and a proposed divestiture. Make no mistake. We are not yet where we need to be. But we are clearly making progress.","So let's take a closer look at each of these regions and their underlying businesses. We'll start with North America. In North America Snacks, sales declines moderated in 2018 to only a slight decline excluding the negative DSD impact. And as suggested on slide number 16, there are some very clear signs of progress. The exit from DSD unlocked brand investment for our major brands and also enabled us to extend support to more brands in the portfolio. And the brands that we supported did very well. Pringles accelerated its consumption growth in 2018 as did Cheez-It and Rice Krispies Treats.","As we look to 2019, these brands should benefit from our strongest innovation line-up in years, many of which launched in January and are off to a very good starts. Elsewhere in our snacking portfolio, RX sustained its strong momentum as I mentioned earlier and we are excited about the prospects for this business which still has so much runway. We will continue to expand its distribution, brand awareness and product line in 2019 and we will also make further progress on other natural brands like Pure Organic bars and Bear Naked bites.","On the slide you can see the sharp acceleration we drove in On the Go offerings, especially in the second half of 2018. We've talked a lot about the extra cost this On the Go expansion added in 2018. But we were willing to absorb these costs temporarily in order to make good on a strategic priority of boosting our offerings for this important occasion.","And as you can see, we are driving strong demand and building a platform for growth. Expect to see these pack formats continue to outpace our categories in 2019 even as we take steps to shore up their margins. So snacks is on its way back to sustainable growth and we would expect growth in 2019, excluding any divestitures.","Now let's turn to cereal in North America and slide number 17. The overall US cereal category moderated its decline in 2018 as did we. And if you exclude the impact of Honey Smacks whose supply chain disruption kept it off-shelf for most of the second half, we held share in the United States. We also gained share in Canada in 2018.","There's also progress behind this results. We know that when food beliefs change, what always brings this category back to stabilization or growth is amplifying its wellness attributes, especially in the adult segment. Kellogg did more of this in 2018 and these efforts were effective in stabilizing key brands like Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats. Expect more of this wellness emphasis in our innovation and communication in 2019, including the launch of a new brand that plays squarely in digestive health.","Meantime, in the Taste\/Fun segment, which grew for the category in 2018, we continued to innovate and this resulted in share gains for our key Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops brands. Expect this to continue in 2019 with a strong lineup of new products hitting the shelves now and communication that also taps into the rapidly growing portion of cereal consumption that is out of breakfast for snacking.","And we are particularly excited about the progress we've made on Kashi cereals. While we had been performing well in natural channels for some time, Kashi consumption in the ex AOC (ph) measured channels turned positive in 2018 thanks to strong innovation and effective messaging. Innovations like Kashi by Kids and new offerings under the GOLEAN line are gaining traction. As you can see, this turnaround was especially pronounced in the second half. So Kashi carries some good momentum into the New Year and we have great plans for 2019. Meanwhile, we also grew consumption for our rising granola brand, Bear Naked, and we have innovation coming for that brand in 2019 as well.","Finally, as we discussed at our Day@K event, we are embarking on an ambitious plan to harmonize pack sizes and make the cereal aisle that much more shoppable. Where we've done this most recently in Europe, we see improved results. This work will be executed across the first half of 2019. We will give you more details on all of these plans at CAGNY. I wouldn't count on growth for North American cereal in 2019 but we will continue to moderate its decline, getting back toward a stable long-term trend.","Now let's turn to slide number 18 and our North America frozen foods business. Consumer trends toward convenient meal preparation have had a positive impact on frozen foods categories, and we've raised our game in both of our key frozen brands. Eggo's consumption and share growth accelerated in 2018 on a strong core and the success of our relaunched premium Thick & Fluffy line as well as continued success with Disney-shaped waffles. This was all supported by effective media.","Morningstar Farms consumption also accelerated in 2018 as we refocused on our core offerings, renovating our food for even cleaner label and honing our message around plant-based protein. So even though consumption growth moderated in the second half as we lapped 2017's market acceleration, we have some momentum going into 2019. And in 2019, you can expect to see us continue to fuel these great brands with investment in innovation, renovation and brand communication. The results should be another year of growth for frozen foods.","Now let's discuss Europe, shown on slide number 19. Europe returned to growth in 2018, led by Pringles whose double digit net sales growth was broad-based with strength in all sub-regions. We ran an extremely successful campaign during the World Cup in the summer and sustained the brand with new pack formats and effective media. The brand grew share in seven of our eight major markets. Clearly, this brand has been revitalized, and in 2019 we will continue to support it with innovation and new commercial initiatives.","We've also made good progress on cereal in Europe. Cereal net sales declined only modestly in 2018, cutting in half its 2017 decrease and improving our share performance in key markets across the region. Most notable were our share gains in the difficult UK and France markets. In fact, we grew cereal share in the UK for the first time in several years, a testament to our ability to run our playbook and stabilize highly penetrated cereal categories. We've revitalized Special K in key markets with a new campaign called Powering You. We've rejuvenated brands like Extra and Crunchy Nut in the granola segment and we've launched a new natural brand called W.K Kellogg. We will continue to run this playbook in 2019.","I would also point out the success Kellogg Europe has been having in emerging markets. We recorded another year of double digit growth in Russia in 2018, growing share in cereal, salty snacks and biscuits and there's so much opportunity to expand further into markets in adjacent Central Europe in 2019.","We also generated strong growth in the Middle East and Northern Africa in 2018, both in cereal and snacks. These businesses will be shifting over to our Asia-Pacific region in 2019. But strong kudos to the Kellogg Europe team for the expansion they have made in this promising region. So Europe enters 2019 in a much stronger position, poised for another year of growth.","Now let's turn to Latin America on slide number 20. Latin America had a fantastic 2018. Its net sales bounced back to growth, growing more than 7% on an organic basis. Leading the way was Mexico, which has now recorded 11 consecutive quarters of currency neutral net sales growth. This momentum has been driven by strong execution in cereal which accelerated its consumption growth in 2018, gaining 2 points of share.","Across the region, in fact, our cereal sales grew at a mid single digit rate in 2018, an impressive positive swing. Our Snacks net sales in Latin America grew at a similar mid single digit rate. Pringles led the way, with notable gains in Mexico and Caribbean\/Central America. And Parati has truly transformed our business in Brazil. Not even a disruptive truckers strike and volatile political climate could take this business off its double digit growth trajectory in 2018. Latin America in 2019 will continue executing its strategy and sustaining its momentum in these key markets.","Rounding out our international businesses, let's discuss our Asia-Pacific region shown on slide number 21. Multipro, the distributor portion of our partnership in West Africa, continues to grow at a double digit clip. This business has enormous potential for growth, and we are very pleased with its momentum, its competitive advantage and what it can do for other Kellogg brands in West Africa.","But Asia-Pacific in 2018 also accelerated its growth on an organic basis. Specifically, the region's organic net sales growth was 5%, a market acceleration from 2017's growth. This was led by cereal whose broad-based growth accelerated in 2018. Our cereal business held share in a stabilized Australian market, gained share in markets like Japan and Korea and continued to generate double digit net sales growth in emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia. In snacks, Pringles accelerated its net sales growth to almost 6% in 2018 and we continued to expand wholesome snacks across the region with great success in newly launched markets like Korea.","As I mentioned, this region is being renamed AMEA to reflect the shift from our European region of our Middle East, North Africa and Turkey businesses. This unites all of our businesses in Africa and the Middle East under one regional management team which offers obvious benefits of scale and resource allocation. We should see continued expansion throughout Africa in 2019, led by Multipro and augmented by expansion of other products such our launch of noodles in South Africa. In Asia, we will drive continued broad-based growth in cereal and Pringles. And in Australia, the region's most developed market, we expect continued stability or even slight growth. So expect another year of good growth in this region in 2019.","So allow me to summarize with slide number 22. Deploy for Growth isn't just words on a piece of paper. It is setting clear priorities for us and it is driving us to tangible and often bold actions. We are in an investment phase, but this isn't simply investing to drive near-term growth. This investment is reshaping our portfolio to one that is more focused and more geared toward growth. This is investment in revitalizing brands, from big brands that are being reformulated and repositioned to our own challenger brands that are just building awareness. And this investment is in capabilities from pack formats that can win important consumer occasions to a better process and pipeline of innovation, from more effective digital and social media to getting ahead in e-commerce.","We are not apologetic about this investment or the fact it is holding down profit for a couple of more quarters because we know that this investment is building a stronger foundation for future growth, growth that is profitable and growth that is sustainable. And it's working. You saw this in our improved net sales performance in 2018 and our improved consumption trends and the improved ROIs we are realizing on our brand building investment. So good progress in 2018, and more to come in 2019. As always, I'd like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our employees who are working so hard to make all this happen.","And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you, and good morning.","Steve Cahillane","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","Actually I want to slip in two questions. One is just a small one on pensions. Fareed, can you walk us through just kind of the mechanical impacts here? You noted the big decline in December. But then as equity markets rebound, it feels like there's no recognition of that. Is it because it gets marked only at the end of the year and you kind of have to live with that through all of '19? And then I have a more substantial follow-up for Steve.","Fareed Khan","You're exactly right, David. It's a point in time calculation. And essentially what it is that the -- the value of the pension assets declines because of the market decline. Our estimates for the return on those assets, while we brought them down in 2017 from 2016 to de-risk the pension, it's still at the same level at 2018. The other factor I'd point you to that plays into this is rising interest rates and then that impacts it as well. So what you have is a pretty significant mark-to-market decline for pensions and that flows through earnings per share. And as I mentioned, that's about a $60 million, $70 million headwind going to next year. But it's all non-cash, it's basically an accounting estimate point in time. And as markets recover, you would see assets come up again. And again, just for those who aren't familiar, so large pension plan -- we've frozen a lot of the key elements. It's very well funded. And we've been making moves to de-risk it with the pension contribution that we made last year.","David Driscoll","And Steve, my little business question is just about the single-serve snack opportunity. It's something like $100 million hit that you took maybe for this investment in 2018, maybe a similar amount in 2019. I'm more interested on what's the size of the price? So your margins are impacted right now but I just don't think that we have a good handle on where the margins for the single-serve businesses can go. And then what's the size of revenues? Or just is there any way that you can dimensionalize why you're putting so much effort into this in terms of a profit opportunity somewhere down the road? Is this going to be worth $300 million, $400 million, $500 million in profits to Kellogg as you really establish the single-serve business? Thank you.","Steve Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. I think what I would say -- what I would start with is, as we think about occasions and focusing more on occasion-based opportunities, we clearly under-index in On the Go pack formats and On the Go channels, On the Go occasions. And so that's why we initially started to spend a lot more time and focus because it's incremental growth opportunities for us. And as we pointed out last year, obviously it came with some pain in terms of it being margin dilutive and even sometimes almost net no margin, but over time we see a clear path toward margin accretion. And so you should see these pack formats over time, really toward the back half of this year, being margin accretive whereas up to this point they've been margin dilutive. But we see it as a big opportunity because it is highly incremental if not completely incremental. It drives more usage of our brands and therefore more awareness, more brand health and so overall points to a very large opportunity. But up to this point, the Company had just not focused on it. And so we went at it fast and hard last year but we've got good plans in place that we started last year, that continued in this year, that over time, particularly as we get to the back half of this year, we will see these pack sizes, these pack formats and these channels becoming much more accretive whereas in the back half of last year obviously they were more of a hurt.","David Driscoll","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So Steve, my question is really around the cost of top line growth. So if you look at 2019 guidance, you're only assuming 1% to 2% organic sales growth that's coming despite two years of investment beginning in 2018, and that's at the low end of your long-term range. So I get your point on the call that it's progress, but it still seems like a pretty muted top line payback relative to a substantial reinvestment versus what we were thinking six months ago. So I guess what gives you confidence that this is enough to drive a top line turnaround to a sustained level in line with your long-term goals and you won't need even more investment beyond 2019 which could basically pressure your ability to hit the long-term profit and EPS algorithm goals in order to get back to that long-term top line goal? Thanks.","Steve Cahillane","Yeah, great. Thank you for the question. I think I'd just reiterate the comment I made in the prepared remarks around it's really the delta between a mid single digit decline getting back toward growth. And so it is a difficult thing to do. You see a lot of companies try and not really be able to revitalize brands and turn what are longer-term declines into growth. And so we are very encouraged by what we've seen in terms of the delta disappearing and getting back to flat. And we are confident that we've got the right plan in place in 2019. The other thing I would tell you in terms of the investments that we're making, particularly in the first half of this year, we're very confident because a lot of it is based on new exciting innovation that we are bringing into the marketplace. If you go into the market right now you'll see big exciting things like Cheez-It Snap'd, Rice Krispies Treats, Poppers, Pringles Wavys, Pop-Tarts Bites, all off to good starts, all supported -- and these are big brands that already have obviously powerful equities. And so you invest behind those with new food formats and fun and exciting commercial ideas that have good returns. In cereal, we launched Pop-Tarts Cereal, again leveraging a very strong core equity. That's off to a good start. And so the early signs of what we are seeing in terms of our new investments in the beginning of this year gives us encouragement that builds on the excitement we saw last year and bending that trajectory from what was a negative decline into positive. And so I fully appreciate that there's Doubting Thomases and we have to show you -- we have to show investors. But we are running our plan. We are confident in our plan and the number one objective to get back to the longer-term algorithm is getting that top line back to sustainable growth. And we feel like we have the plan in place to make that happen.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. And as you look beyond 2019, just a follow-up, it doesn't sound like there are big areas of reinvestment that you might need beyond 2019 like the -- on the Eggo area this year, because I'm just trying to put it in context. If I go back over a longer period of time, much of which wasn't under your tenure, but if I go back five or six years, we've really seen (inaudible) come down significantly as a percent of sales. So I'm just trying to understand if sort of this 2019 base really gives you what you need going forward or if there could be other big areas of investment beyond 2019.","Steve Cahillane","We feel like we are at a very reasonable level of investment for us going forward. And you'll see us turn our attention ever more to ROIs to getting the most that we possibly can out of the investments that we are making. It's a new world, obviously, with digital, social and so forth. And so that's part of maybe the decline over the years. But we do feel like we are at a good level of investment right now. We took bold moves obviously to get us back to where we are today. And we feel comfortable that we've got the right levels. You'll see us allocate that and reallocate that over time. But in terms of a headline number we feel pretty comfortable we are in a good place.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson","Hey, so good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just maybe for either -- it's probably Steve. I'm not sure who will answer, but will you take all of your puts and takes on your operating profit margins? When we look out -- and this would be including the mix with Multipro, et cetera -- when we look at 2020 which would I guess would be the year that we should be looking for a more normalized adjusted operating profit margin, what should that margin look like on an apples-to-apples basis?","Steve Cahillane","Yeah, I'll start and leave it over to Fareed. We are not obviously giving -- we gave the 2019 guidance, so I'd be cautious about going all the way to 2020 guidance. But as you think about the way that we've constructed this year and obviously some significant headwinds, many of which are mechanical in the first half of the year and then in the back half of the year we get to something much closely -- which much more closely resembles our aspirational algorithm and so we'd enter 2020 with that kind of tailwind momentum. And so Fareed, I don't know if you want to build on it.","Fareed Khan","Well, I'd say we are still confident in our long-term algorithm that we put out several times. And if you look at the shape of '19, we'll have some detailed kind of outlining where that is and you look at sort of how that year progresses and what that means for our exit rate from 2019 that should give you a bit of confidence as well. The main thing is returning businesses to top line, we've got -- we will have a more focused portfolio. We will have more targeted brand investment. And a lot of this innovation is going to be accretive. We will be addressing some of those single-serve dynamics as we've talked about. And then in the backdrop we still have very strong growth rate consistently in our emerging markets. And then you'll see there as we build scale, as we have more relevant local foods, as we are bringing more value to the market, that that will improve as well. So you get the benefits of scale, you've got some very specific timing things that you can see play out in '19 and then sort of the underlying economics of as -- we build scale in emerging markets. So again, those things together, give us confidence in the algorithm that we put out there.","Eric Larson","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up question. It was really -- it's related to what David was asking on the pension fund. So when you look back over the -- it has been pretty consistent for the last x number of years, you have been making fairly significant voluntary cash contributions to the pension which has done a pretty good cash usage. Are we getting to a point where the pension fund is funded to the point where those voluntary contributions can actually start receiving a bit? I mean, how should we think about that?","Fareed Khan","Yeah. So we know it's a large pension plan as I've talked about. It's frozen, at least key elements have been frozen both in North America and in Europe. So that help sort of contain the obligations. It's about 91.4% funded, so well-funded. And we've been making contributions toward it. As we made those contributions like we did with some of the cash proceeds we received from US tax reform, we also have changed the asset allocation mix to begin to de-risk it as well and accompanying that was lowering our expected return on assets which started in 2018 and also come into 2019. And so what you'd expect from all of that is you'll get the de-risk plan well-funded, pivot to de-risk the returns. And we unfortunately, just given the timing of December and what the markets were doing there's an accounting EPS impact that will go into next year. But again, that's non-cash, that's point in time. We'll review that as sort of anything will fundamentally shift the quality of the program that we have already.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you. Fareed, I was hoping you could help me bridge the net income to cash flow for 2019 because it -- there's just something missing there and the cash flow seems very low. If you start with adjusted net income of maybe $1.4 billion, even when I take into account higher CapEx spending, it's just hard to get down to the $950 million of free cash flow. And I want to know is there something else in there especially given the fact that you say that working capital should be a source of cash. What else gets us that low, to $950 million?","Fareed Khan","Yeah. I think -- we've got durable cash flow as we talked about. Our CapEx up a little bit year-over-year and the mix of that CapEx is shifting more toward capacity and growth to support what we are seeing happening in the business. So CapEx is going to be up a little bit. But essentially the other moving parts are pretty straightforward. So from an operating profit perspective, we are forecasting about flattish. There'll be lower tax benefits going into 2019 versus '18 both from a combination of tax reform as well as the discrete items that we've had. And then offsetting some of that was the pension contribution we made last year. So...","Robert Moskow","Okay. Fareed, maybe -- maybe I could bridge it a little differently though. Because if you start with $1.4 billion of net income, you take the D&A, you add that back, you subtract the CapEx, you'd still be quite a bit higher than the $950 million that you're guiding to. So there must be some other non-cash income in the net income level number or some kind of tax related issue that gets you lower to $950 million and maybe this needs to be taken off-line, but it...","Fareed Khan","That might be better. But let me go -- and like I said we've sort of outlined the key moving parts. There are some pretty major year-over-year tax rate differences. Our base rate for '18 is going to be 16.5% and your outlook for '19 is quite a bit higher. So there might be some of those dynamics going on, but it might be better offline. But again, nothing that I'd point to you say would be unusual we haven't talked about in the call.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Thank you. Good morning. You talked about some new brands launching and obviously typically those cost more than extensions or innovation under any current brands. Can you give a little more color on what some of those might be or what categories and why you thought it would make sense to pursue a new brand approach? And then some of these presumably white space opportunities? Did you also look at M&A as an alternative? And how did you think about that comparison?","Steve Cahillane","Yeah, Michael, thanks for the question. We are doing a combination of all of the above that you just mentioned. So some of the -- some of the things that are more capable of moving the needle if you like are the ones that I mentioned that are big brand related like Cheez-It Snap'd, Rice Krispies, Poppers and so forth. But there's also some very interesting white space that we are launching into this year. One of those is around digestive health, and we are launching a brand called Happy Inside which we are very excited about and we are going to learn as we launch this. It does require investment but we also felt that it was such a unique space that the launch of a new brand versus extending one of our existing brands into that space was more appropriate. We also scanned the horizon and looked at from an M&A perspective is there somebody in that space. And the net of all those things led us to believe that Happy Inside as a new launch, a new brand was the best alternative for us. We also have a product called Joybol which is a softer launch which is really about hyper convenience as a major trend and one of the occasions that we talk about is the deskfast occasion which is think about really everybody but particularly millennials who are on the go who tend to put their snack or breakfast in a knapsack, go to work and then have it on their breakfast -- or have it at their desk. So Joybol is another new brand we are launching into that space. Some of the same reasons we just didn't feel like an extension of one of our existing brands was as relevant to launching a new brand. So we'd do a combination of all of the above. Extending our brands where we feel like they have a right to play and a right to win and it actually reinforces the core equities of those brands versus diluting those brands. And so that's one of the prisms we look toward brand extensions. White space, where we have the opportunity to launch a new brand with appropriate levels of investment behind. And then M&A, which you saw us do most recently in the same type of space with RX which filled a big white space opportunity for us where we felt like the launch of our own brand would be far too expensive and extending our own existing brands into that space wouldn't be as successful as acquiring RX. So look for us to do all of the above. But those are two examples of launching new brands to answer your question.","Michael Lavery","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning, and congratulations on turning Kashi cereal around. It's a nice improvement.","Steve Cahillane","Thank you.","Steve Strycula","As you think about the revenue bridge from where you tracked in fourth quarter to where you're going at midpoint of next year, can you walk through a few of the pieces that start to enter the comp base and how they help you scale the reported consolidation of the results, particularly Multipro and RXBAR? I know those are much faster growing. And then what does that imply for the base business?","Fareed Khan","It's Fareed. So we sort of talk about the organic growth rate, 1% to 2%. We see sort of the larger developed markets, so North America, Europe being in slight growth. And in North America, we've gotten through the DSD, we've gotten through the pricing dynamics, so there's more of a clean base there. The investments that we have been making around our big brands, we are seeing good performance. We are seeing that momentum building and then overlaid to that are some of the innovations that Steve talked about. So the snacks portfolio had some nice momentum building and then we see sequential improvement in cereal. And if you look at 2018 versus 2017, there was some improvement and we expect that to continue. It may not be all the way to growth but -- and then some of the other businesses that we mentioned, frozen performing strongly, On the Go and convenience really helping some of our specialty channels. And then Kashi, as you noted, some nice improvements in part of that business with RTEC. Europe, a similar story where there's been really good Pringles momentum in 2018. We really benefited from football. But we also have some gaming and other things going on there. So we do see Europe in growth. And then our emerging markets, which are becoming a larger part of our portfolio. Australia, which is a big market in Asia-Pacific, nice progression there, particularly in the cereals category. And then we've seen strong double-digit growth in a lot of the markets. Again, we are placing fewer bets, really building scale in high potential growth markets like Brazil and India, certainly in West Africa, as you've seen. So we still have mid single growth rates in Latin America, in Asia, slight growth in North America and Europe, and that gets you pretty solidly in the range that we gave. But again, the momentum that we are seeing in some of these big brands and some of these big categories, whether it's RX or in the core is what gives us confidence behind those numbers. So hope that helps.","Steve Strycula","It was very helpful. And then any language around RXBAR or Multipro's contribution? And then I'll pass it along. Thank you.","Fareed Khan","Just that great businesses; they've been growing at double digit growth rates. Lot of potential in both in slightly different ways. RX obviously expanding its distribution base. Also some extensions into nut butters or RX Kids that have been progressing well. And Multipro, we view West Africa as just a terrific long-term bet, and it's a proven business model. Phenomenal distribution reach in that market, and it's going to benefit from just fundamental demographics, rising incomes and we've seen that business go through ups and downs of -- whether it's energy prices or transitions. It's a very strong, very stable business. And so we see that momentum continuing. And again, you have large businesses growing at double digit growth rates. So obviously those are very accretive to the overall top line results.","Steve Cahillane","I think we are at 10:30, operator, so at this point we have to wrap it up.","Operator","Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks.","John Renwick","Thanks, everyone, for your interest. I'm around all day. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12721":["Kellogg (NYSE:K) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Simon Burton - Executive Officer of Snacks business unit","John A.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Hewey. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for a review of our first quarter 2012 results. I'm joined here by John Bryant, our President and CEO; and Ron Dissinger, our Chief Financial Officer. The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com.","As you are aware, certain statements today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. ","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, April 30, and the call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. Now I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thank you, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We posted lower-than-expected results in the first quarter, in what proved to be a difficult operating environment. In fact, as you have seen in the data, volume growth across the industry and across most categories in the U.S. was challenging in the quarter.","The results we announced on Monday were obviously disappointing. However, we have recognized over the years that setting realistic goals is an important driver of the success of our business. Given the difficult start to the year, we have revised our growth expectations for 2012. We believe that 2% to 3% sales growth for the year is a pragmatic goal and is one that allows us to follow our long-term model and invest in future growth. Lowering guidance is never easy, but it makes it possible for us to remain committed to our operating principles.","As you'll remember from the fourth quarter call, we anticipated a continued difficult environment in specific categories and geographies throughout the year. This was certainly the case in Europe. We will discuss this in more detail later, but Europe's weak performance accounted for the majority of the impact on the quarter. As a result of this and the early weakness in the U.S., total internal revenue growth for the quarter was approximately flat, lower than we originally expected. ","It's also important to note that while we've adjusted our expectations for full year revenue growth because of weaker-than-expected revenue performance in the first quarter, we've adjusted our expectations for operating profit and earnings to allow us to continue to invest in the future growth of the business, while also absorbing the impact of the first quarter. Obviously, the timing of this year's delivery and even the shape will likely change, given the first quarter's results and the pending acquisition of Pringles that we announced in February. Also, as we told you last quarter, we still see 2012 as a continuation of the transition we began in 2011. As I've said, we remain committed to driving future growth and plan to invest in the business. As you might imagine however, the inclusion of Pringles will also change the timing and even the specifics of this investment. ","The planning for the integration of the Pringles business remains on track. It's still relatively early, but we're making good progress. We still expect to close the transaction around or before the middle of the year, and look forward to the benefits that will accrue from the combination of these 2 fantastic businesses. ","And now, if you'll turn to Slide 4, you'll see some more detail regarding the progress we've made with the planning of the integration. Both Kellogg and P&G have transition planning teams in place. We've evaluated the integration process, we've highlighted the milestones we need to reach and when we need to reach them, and we have a plan in place that will enable us to achieve our goals. There's been a lot of work on both sides, but things are progressing well.","The financing of the deal is also going well. We've had good support from the banks, and we expect a good reception from the market.","And as you might imagine, we remain very excited about the strategic rationale of this combination. As we discussed when we announced the transaction, the growth potential we see and the international scale that Pringles provides are very important to us. In addition, while we didn't build any synergies from product expansion into the financials of the deal, we do believe that there is the potential for us to recognize a meaningful amount over the years. Obviously, we'll give you more detail on future calls. ","And finally, Slide 5 gives an update on our supply chain initiative. As you all know, we increased the level of our investment by $100 million in 2011. We will, of course, look for ways to reduce this amount, but we remain committed to continually improving the entire supply chain organization.","We continue to make very good progress, and as we've discussed previously, are implementing Kellogg best practices across our North American network. The supply chain organization is focused on producing great food, improving customer service, continuously improving both people and food safety, productivity enhancements and executing our strategy while delivering the financial results. And we continue to make considerable investment in facilities and our people. This includes increasing the amount of training and improving its efficacy. This investment in our processes and systems is driving increased engagement, development, and improved results and efficiencies.","I'm proud of the hard work undertaken by the whole organization and the improvements we have made. This is an ongoing process and we're making good progress. And now I'll turn it over to Ron for a review of our financial highlights.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning. If you'll turn to Slide 6, you'll see our quarterly financial summary. We posted reported revenue growth that was down approximately 1% in the quarter, on top of 5% growth in the first quarter of last year. Internal sales were approximately flat, on top of 3% growth last year. Internal operating profit decreased by 6% in the quarter. The decline in profit is driven by higher commodity cost and weakness in our European business. In addition, operating profit was also negatively impacted by the shape of the investment in supply chain. We mentioned in our guidance that commodity inflation was more front-half-weighted and supply chain investments would be made across the year. Reported earnings per share were unchanged in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. It includes some below-the-line favorability. ","Slide 7 details the components of sales growth in the first quarter. As I mentioned, reported sales decreased by 1% and internal sales were approximately flat, including strong price and mix of 4.4%. Tonnage declined by 4.5%, as a result of the weakness in Europe and in U.S. Morning Foods. We continue to expect that volume will be under pressure this year, but that it will improve as we progress through the year. Finally, currency decreased overall growth by approximately 1 point. ","Slide 8 shows our gross profit performance for the quarter. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and gross margin declined by 90 basis points to 39.9%. As we mentioned last quarter, commodity inflation and a more evenly balanced investment in our supply chain would have a meaningful impact on this quarter's results. These 2 factors contributed equally to our decline in gross margin. ","Slide 9 shows the progression of our investment in brand building in recent quarters. Investment declined in the first quarter, although we were lapping a significant increase of 10% in the first quarter of 2011. So it's partially an issue of comps and timing. We have replanned our investment in Europe because we weren't seeing the returns we wanted in Q1. In addition, Europe invests a significant percentage of sales in brand building and although we've decreased this level for 2012, we're still investing more in the region than the company average on a percent-of-sales basis. For the total company, we still expect to increase brand building at a rate equal to or greater than sales growth for the full year. ","Slide 10 shows our internal operating profit performance for each of the businesses by area and the company as a whole. Operating profit decreased by 6% in the quarter, with the decline being driven primarily by higher commodity costs, weak results in Europe and increased supply chain investments.","North America's internal operating profit decreased by approximately 5% in the first quarter. The impact of commodity cost inflation on this business was significant, and the effect of the timing of the supply chain investment is primarily a North American issue. Europe's internal operating profit declined by 20% in the quarter due to the lower sales and the continued difficult operating environment in certain parts of the region. We have issues that we are addressing in this region and though the improvement will take some time, we're optimistic that we're taking the right actions to improve performance. John will discuss this in more detail shortly. In Latin America, internal operating profit increased by 11% in the first quarter, driven by a strong 7% sales growth, supported by double-digit increases in brand building. The business continues to benefit from both good innovation and effective commercial programs. And finally, internal operating profit in Asia Pacific decreased by 1% due to some weakness in Australia and a customer dispute in the region. ","Now, let's turn to Slide 11 and cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter was $277 million, ahead of last year's $207 million. Working capital was a little higher than we would like, given the sales weakness in the quarter. This will be an area of focus for us over the balance of the year, as we plan to reduce inventory by lowering production in our plants. Timing of capital spending contributed favorably to our cash flow performance, although we still expect to invest at a rate of 4% to 5% of sales for the year. And we purchased approximately $63 million in shares early in the quarter. Obviously, we still plan to significantly reduce the level of our share repurchases for the year, in order to pay down debt associated with the Pringles acquisition. ","Slide 12 details our full year guidance for 2012. To be clear, internal sales and internal operating profit exclude the impact of Pringles, but our earnings per share guidance includes Pringles-related accretion and onetime costs, as well as the impact of our reduced share repurchase program.","We have adjusted our expectations for internal net sales growth to a range between 2% and 3%, and we expect volume to be down for the year, softer than we originally planned. The change in guidance is due mainly to the weakness we have seen in Europe and category softness in the U.S. We expect that gross margin for the year will be down approximately 50 to 100 basis points, and we also continue to anticipate around 7% COGS inflation, driven by commodity inflation, part of which will be offset by supply chain productivity savings. In fact, we continue to expect savings from productivity to be slightly above 3%, consistent with our long-term targets.","We now anticipate that internal operating profit will be lower by 2% to 4% for the full year. Although we will invest in brand building in 2012, as I mentioned earlier, we brought our expectation for investment in brand building in Europe down from our original estimate. We've also reduced our overhead costs across the businesses and anticipate that these actions will help offset some of the impact of lower sales growth. We expect that interest expense will be slightly favorable in 2012, including the cost associated with Pringles debt, partially offset by the benefit from the interest rate hedges. We continue to expect that the full year tax rate will be approximately 30%.","As you can see, we've also adjusted our guidance for reported earnings per share. Specifically, we now expect reported EPS will fall into a range between $3.18 and $3.30 per share. The impact of currency is included as a headwind of approximately $0.04, unchanged from the estimate we provided last quarter. ","You'll remember that we provided an earnings per share walk in our CAGNY presentation, and while some of the puts and takes in the walk related to the Pringles acquisition might change over the course of the year, our best estimate at the moment is that things haven't changed meaningfully, except for the gain on interest rate hedges. As John said earlier, we've done a lot of work on the integration planning and we'll let you know on future calls when we alter our estimates.","We continue to expect that full year cash flow will be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, including the revised earnings guidance and the benefit of the pending acquisition of Pringles. Capital spending is still expected to be between 4% and 5% of sales. And as we told you when we announced the acquisition of Pringles, we expect to reduce our share repurchases significantly to allow us to pay down debt associated with the acquisition. ","Finally, we expect sales growth to improve in the second quarter, but operating profit may decline more than it did in the first quarter due to commodity inflation, timing of supply chain investments and reduced operating leverage as we reduce our inventory levels. Both sales and profit should improve in the second half as commodity inflation subsides and we lap the increase in our back half supply chain investments in 2011. And now let me turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Slide 13 shows the internal revenue growth for Kellogg North America and Kellogg International in the first quarter. Revenue growth in Kellogg North America was 2%. Kellogg International posted 4% lower sales in the quarter, primarily as a result of the weak results in Europe. ","Now, let's turn to Slide 14 and some details on our U.S. business by segment. As we highlighted in last year's 10-K, we're now providing this additional data, which will give you more insight into the business. As you all saw in the measured channel data, a majority of the U.S. food industry faced weak volume performance in the first quarter. While not all of our businesses were affected, some were, as you can see on the chart. ","Slide 15 shows the performance of our U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi segment. You'll remember that we mentioned last quarter that we thought the cereal category would remain challenging throughout 2012, and that was the case in the first quarter. The segment's internal net sales declined by 1.7%, due mainly to the weak category volume performance in the U.S. In fact, measured channel data shows cereal category volume down approximately 7% in the quarter, which is a significant hurdle.","Total category sales were flat to up slightly in all channels in Q1, and we lost a little share after gaining an equivalent amount in 2011. So the category's relatively unchanged, as is our share over the last couple of years. Importantly, we expect that consumers will better accept recent price increases over the next few months. However, it's also important to note that our all-channel performance improved progressively as we moved through the quarter. Just as sales performance develops during the quarter, we're expecting gradually increasing growth in the business throughout the remainder of the year, given the actions we are taking and the programs and introductions we have planned. Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes posted good results in the quarter as a result of strong support, and Krave, an innovation which was launched in the U.S. at the end of last year, is doing very well. In fact, in the latest measured channel data, Krave is up to a 1 share.","Our Kashi business had a good quarter and gained share in both cereal and wholesome snacks. Our GOLEAN Crisp! crumble cereal innovation exceeded expectations and the Bear Naked brand also helped drive the share performance. In fact, Kashi cereal sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate and Bear Naked cereal sales grew at a double-digit rate. So while the business had a good quarter, we expect continued growth in the balance of the year and have additional innovation planned to help us achieve these goals. ","Slide 16 shows the performance of our U.S. Snacks business in recent quarters. In Q1, we saw a solid 2.3% growth due to excellent results in both the crackers and cookies businesses. The cracker category increased by more than 3% in measured channels in the quarter and we gained share, driven by good growth in Special K Cracker Chips and Cheez-It. Cheez-It did well and was up high single digit in growth, partially as a result of the introduction of a new mozzarella flavor and the popular vote for the top cheese program, which allowed consumers to vote for their favorite flavor in an election year campaign. Special K Cracker Chips continue to be a huge success and the 2 newest flavors, Southwestern (sic) [Southwest] Ranch and Cheddar, are doing well, as are the existing flavors. In cookies, we saw a measured channel category growth of almost 5%. We saw a 4% growth in our Keebler brand sales, a focus for us over the last year. ","In our wholesome snack business, consumption declined at a mid-single-digit rate, partially as a result of the timing of innovation. However, we have some great products planned for introduction in the second half, including 2 SKUs of FiberPlus nutty delights and 2 new flavors of Special K Pastry Crisps, brown sugar cinnamon and chocolate. In addition, we've got news on Rice Krispies Treats and a new campaign on Nutri-Grain. ","As you can see on Slide 17, the U.S. Specialty segment had a very good quarter as a result of increased focus, innovation and improved execution. We gained share in the Foodservice channel, the largest in the segment, and in the convenience channel as well. And we increased our sales to all of our key customers, some at a double-digit rate. The segment's growth was driven by good innovation from Eggo, Special K Cracker Chips and strong growth from Morningstar Farms and Gardenburger in our frozen veggie business in Foodservice. And we also saw a growing revenue in snacking across the Specialty Channel, driven by Cheez-It and Rice Krispies Treats. ","Now, let's turn to Slide 18 and the North America Other segment. This segment includes our Canadian business and our frozen foods business. Sales in the Canadian business decreased in the first quarter, due mainly to difficult comparisons from 2011, given the timing of a cereal price increase last year. However, both the frozen and snack businesses gained share and we launched Special K Cracker Chips during the quarter. It's early for Special K Cracker Chips, shaping up to be a great launch in Canada.","The frozen foods business had another great quarter, posting double-digit sales growth. We continue to gain share in the frozen breakfast category. In fact, sales increased in all of our frozen categories. Our Eggo Wafflers innovation has done well since its introduction in January, and sales of our Thick & Fluffy waffles continue to grow and the new pack sizes are being very well-received by consumers.","Finally, from Morningstar Farms brand, new veggie hotdogs and veggie meatballs also exceeded our initial expectations in the retail channel. ","Now, let's turn to Slide 19 and a discussion of Kellogg International. As we have mentioned a few times already, and as you can see, the performance posted by our European business in the quarter was disappointing. You all know that this business has been challenging for some time. The weakness was due to a combination of the difficult economic environment in the region and some issues specific to Kellogg. While we're not pleased with the sales performance in the quarter, some of the issues are short term and we expect that we have seen the worst of the declines. About half of the quarter's decline came from lower consumption due to elasticity. The other half came from the timing of events and customer disputes on the continent. These disputes are now behind us, but the impact was meaningful. There have also been some operational issues, which we've worked hard to resolve.","We expect Q2 sales to be down as the price settles in with consumers, and we expect that Q2's profit will decline at a rate similar to Q1's decline, reflecting absorption and inflation. However, we do have some great products planned for introduction, including All-Bran Golden Crunch, Special K chocolate and strawberry cereals on the continent, as well as Crunchy Nut cranberry and almond in cereal and Nutri-Grain breakfast biscuits, and Special K biscuit moments in snacks in the U.K. ","And finally, we made significant changes to management in Europe. We have a new lead in the U.K. Many of you know Paul Norman, the President of Kellogg International. Paul is now the acting head of the European business, devoting all his time to the business, and he's working hard to improve the quality of our commercial plants. The Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses are both reporting directly to me until things begin to improve in Europe. We all recognize that it will take some time to implement meaningful changes but we know that in Paul's capable hands, the situation will improve. ","Our Asia Pacific business posted a sales growth of 2% in the quarter. The Australian business posted a low single-digit decrease in internal sales. Most of the other areas in the region posted sales growth. The Australian market continues to be difficult, as both the cereal and snacks categories posted declines. However, we did launch Be Natural and All-Bran innovations in the first quarter, both of which have exceeded our expectations. And we have more innovation and additional commercial programs planned for the second half, that we expect to drive improved sales growth.","Elsewhere in the region, we saw very good rates of growth in South Korea, Southeast Asia and India. We faced a customer issue in the region, which is now behind us. We launched some good innovation in the first quarter, including Nutri-Grain cereal. We've also just launched Corn Flakes hot porridge, which provides us with an entry into a segment that is already popular in South Africa. ","Our Latin American business posted 7% sales growth. We benefited from a successful Star Wars promotion and excellent innovation, including Special K Fruit and Yogurt. We also successfully relaunched All-Bran in Mexico with a simplified portfolio. And we have more All-Bran and Special K innovation planned for introduction around midyear. As a result of this activity, we expect continued strong performance from the region over the balance of the year. ","Now, let's turn to Slide 20 and the summary. Obviously, we're unhappy with the results we posted in the first quarter and we never want to lower guidance, but we need to run the business for the long term. While we do expect gradual improvement in our performance as the year progresses, we want to have the flexibility to make continued investment in future growth.","Our revised guidance enables us to invest in the long-term health of the business. Brand building and innovation are the core of our operating principles, and we realize that periods of weak demand are the ones that provide us the greatest opportunity to increase our efforts. We are committed to our long-term model and the principles that built the company, and that's why we're so excited about the acquisition of Pringles. Pringles is a brand in which we can invest, and the combination gives us added confidence that we'll meet our long-term goals.","I'm excited by the opportunities available to this great company and know we're doing the right things to strengthen our base, increase our potential and drive growth in the years to come. I'd like to take the opportunity also to thank the dedication of our 30,000 Kellogg employees globally. Their hard work can clearly make the difference for our company. With that, I'd like to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask of -- actually, I guess a two-pronged question. Firstly, around the change in segmentation in the U.S., what was the thinking behind that? Because obviously, you've stuck with the same segmentation for, I guess, quite a long time now. And then specifically within the U.S. cereal business, what do you -- can you break out what the internal growth was there in terms of volume and pricing, and what you're seeing in terms of category growth and share trends there?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Let me take the first part of that, Alexia. Our intent in providing the additional segmentation in North America is to provide information on how we view the business and how we manage the performance of the business as well. So we've broken out the North America position as a result of that.","John A. Bryant","Alexia, if you look within the cereal category, we have, within measured data, around a 6%, 7% decline in Kellogg volume in the first quarter. So as you expect, that's coming through quite strongly in our reported results as well. In terms of the share progression, what we've seen in cereal in the first quarter is we lost about 30 basis points of share -- of value share in the measured channels, and we estimate that's probably close to the 50 basis points when you look at all channels, so including the non-measured channels, which was similar to the amount of share that we gained last year. So our share is essentially flat if you go back 2 years. I think we are seeing better performance in the non-measured channels compared to the measured channels, and we do believe that there is some shifting going on between those channels. So our volume is down in the Morning Foods and Kashi segment, and it's down sort of similar levels to what you see in the measured channel data, or they're slightly better than them.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Do you have a view as to what's driving that cereal weakness in terms of volumes in the U.S.?","John A. Bryant","I think we're seeing a higher level of elasticity to pricing than we expected to see in the U.S. It's higher than we saw in the first quarter of last year, and we're seeing a similar dynamic in the U.K. In terms of our business, our business declined in the first period in line with our expectations. But that elasticity has been in the marketplace for longer and at a greater rate over the quarter than we anticipated.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","John, I wanted to ask you about the Europe and the U.K. You obviously mentioned that, that has been a bit of a problem area for a while. I wanted to get from you perhaps a rough breakdown of the deterioration that you saw in the quarter. How much of it was the customer-specific issue you mentioned, the operational issue you mentioned? And maybe you can elaborate on what that was. And then how much of it, of course, is a macro deterioration that we, as analysts, should be paying attention to, not just for you but for the group?","John A. Bryant","It's a great question, David. When we look at Europe, clearly it's a very difficult economic environment. That's playing a little bit into our results but I think the real issue here is Kellogg-specific. We've got some issues in our business, which is -- the good news is we have the ability to fix that and get back on track in Europe. If we look in the first quarter, our sales are down around 10%. About half of that is due to consumption. Some combination within that half is due to the customer disputes, as well as higher-than-expected elasticity. And then the other half of the decline in net sales in Europe in the first quarter was due to the customer disputes impacting trade inventory levels and the timing of events. For example, our innovation on the continent was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter because of some of those customer disputes. As I look at the U.K., most of our issues in the U.K. come down to 2 core brands: Special K and Crunchy Nut. On both of those brands, we have new campaigns coming out in the middle of the year and new innovation on both brands as well. So I believe we are taking the right steps to improve the performance in the U.K. I believe that's in our control to do that. On the continent, we actually saw, if you go back to 2011, better results in the first half of the year and then the continent was starting to soften in the back half of last year, and that softness is continuing into the front half of this year. I'm a little concerned there that the economic environment is weighing a little bit more on our business. The opportunity on the continent is really around Special K again, and we have a very exciting program in the back half of the year on that particular brand. So I feel good that we're making the right decisions in Europe and making progress.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One separate one. I think Ron mentioned the brand-building investments are going to be down in Europe this year. Is that perhaps saving your powder for the Pringles business on-boarding and an increase that could happen in 2013? I mean -- well, perhaps you could elaborate on that a little bit.","Ronald L. Dissinger","We've been disappointed on the return on the investment of our European brand-building, so we have pulled back a little bit here in the first half because we didn't feel like the programs were strong enough. The back half program is still largely intact and we have some exciting ideas to put that money behind. If you look at Europe in totality, we actually spent a little bit more on brand building in Europe than we do as a company average. So I still think we have plenty of money available and investment available to drive the business. I think the key to us driving our European business in the future is to ramp up the rate of innovation. If I go back to 2010, we only launched about $40 million of new sales from innovation. 2011, $60 million. 2012, we have a stretch goal to launch $100 million of new products from innovation that are coming here later in the year.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, in the 10-K, as you noted, you started to break out some of the individual components of North America. And my question, I guess, is on the margin in the U.S. Morning Foods segment. It was about 20% a few years back and has moved lower every year, and I guess now is more in the  16%, 17% range. I understand the higher input cost environment and I think you mentioned some of the timing of supply chain investments, but I guess I was hoping you can provide a bit more color on this. I guess that level just strikes me as low, given my perception of the healthy sort of profitability of cereal for you and as a category, which is obviously such a key part of this segment. And I guess as part of that, do you see this more recent level as more representative of a -- sort of a structural level? Or should 20% be achievable again here in the not-too-distant future?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Andrew, if you look at our 10-K, our margin on morning foods and Kashi, that segment we disclosed, was around 18%. I think it's important to note that, that segment wears the brand-building investment for all of the product lines it houses. So cereal, Pop-Tarts. It has about a 2 to 3 point drag on operating margin. So clearly, the underlying margin is a bit stronger than what you see in the 10-K. We feel very good about the margin in our morning foods and Kashi operating segment. There are no structural reasons why we can't continue to work and improve that margin.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Do you think it kind of gets allocated a disproportionate amount of sort of the...","Ronald L. Dissinger","Brand building, yes.","John A. Bryant","Andrew, it keeps all the brand building in the U.S. business for those cereal brands, even though some of the sales might occur in other businesses such as specialty and even snacks to a degree that it leverages the Special K brand. To your point of the margin, we believe that we can improve the margins in morning foods, Kashi over time. That is more of a \"low-single-digit sales growth\"-type business and that obviously, we'd hope to drive that profitability faster in that segment.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And then just one quick one on pricing. I guess I had modeled for whatever reason, although I thought pricing overall at the corporate level would be maybe something similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter or a bit higher. And it came down sequentially. So I didn't know if there was some change to what you were doing from a pricing standpoint or if it's just simply starting to lap some of the pricing from last year. I'm trying to get a better handle on that and how that moves going forward.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, we'd be lapping a bit of the pricing given the timing of our price execution in 2011, Andrew. So there's nothing that we've done that would structurally impact that pricing. We obviously took pricing before we entered the year in that business.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I have 2 questions. One is getting back to the U.K. and EU problems. I think in past quarters, you've mentioned the competitive challenges in snacks with General Mills and Nature Valley, and Kraft with their Belvita product. Yet you didn't say anything about that. Can you talk about the competitive landscape? And why isn't that factoring into the weakness?","John A. Bryant","Eric, on snacks, you're right. There have been 2 new entrants into the snacks category, both General Mills and Kraft. That has adversely impacted our business. It is down in the first quarter. It's not a huge driver of the European decline. I think our issues in Europe are more cereal-based in the first quarter, but snacks continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we have strong innovation coming out the back half of the year.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then I guess as a -- the follow-up would be on, what should give investors confidence and shareholders confidence that the company, with a number of challenges, seemingly kind of whipsawing things from quarter-to-quarter -- why should we have confidence, John, that Pringles is going to go kind of as planned? I mean, I realize Australia has been an area of retailer disputes, but I don't remember hearing from other companies that they've had retailer disputes in the -- in Europe. And yet, you're about to acquire a business that's got a significant portion of business around the world. Why should we have confidence that this is going to go okay?","John A. Bryant","All right, let me talk about Pringles. And we remain very excited about Pringles. We think it gives us a great new platform for growth. It helps us with our international scale in several markets. And we believe it really helps us unlock the snack opportunity in International that the company has managed to achieve in the U.S. So we think Pringles is a great opportunity. We have a set of integration teams working between P&G and Kellogg to bring Pringles on board. There's a tremendous set of individuals coming with that business that we think will help us as a company going forward. And the plans that those -- that the Pringles team has are exciting for the next couple of years. So we think there's tremendous opportunity. Obviously, with any integration, particularly a carve-out, it's a complex process because we have to take it from being supported by P&G's IT systems and support functions to Kellogg. That's why we have teams working on this and we're spending a lot of time and effort making sure this goes seamlessly. On the broader issues, Eric, I recognize that there's been more volatility in the last year or 2 in our business. I think that reflects what has happened to us over a longer period of time. So if you go back to 2001 through 2009, the company had tremendous momentum. Our sustainable growth model was working. We were reinvesting back in the business, growing our front foot. And bad things were happening to us. We were able to resolve them and just keep moving. 2010, '11, we had the supply chain issues in our business. We invested back a significant amount of money, capital, time, operating expense, resources and that took away our momentum as a company. We're working to rebuild the momentum. We saw some good top line momentum in 2011. We're off to a disappointing start in 2012. I believe the first quarter is more of an anomaly, but we're providing pragmatic guidance for the year of 2% to 3% top line growth, and I believe we're making the right decisions for the long term to get ourselves back on track.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just follow-up on that, so what should we read into these retailer disputes? I mean, is it the retailer power in kicking you while you're down? Like, are they taking the opportunity to pick a company that's lost its momentum and trying to gain things? Or because again, I don't remember hearing from other companies so many retailer disputes.","John A. Bryant","Eric, I think that taking pricing in continental Europe is probably the most difficult part of the world to take pricing in. In a commodity-inflationary environment, we need to take that pricing to protect the long-term economics of our business. And that can be -- that can lead to very difficult discussions, loss of promotional activity. And it is the nature of the business. It's hard to predict when or how long those things will occur. It happened to us here in the first quarter of this year.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the decision to lower production in your plants, I think that's what you said, in order to reduce inventory? I understand the move, but how should we think about and perhaps model the impact on your fixed cost leverage from this decision?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, it's -- you can expect over the next couple of quarters that we'll see some adverse impact flowing through our cost of goods sold as a result. So when we came to the first quarter, as a result of sales being a bit softer than expected, we ended up with higher inventory levels, as I said. So over the next couple of quarters, we'll see an adverse impact from reduced operating leverage by pulling production levels down and pulling our inventories down.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. Is there any way for us to kind of quantify that? Or is it too early to tell?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, too early to -- I wouldn't say too early necessarily, but to quantify it, I believe, would not be appropriate at this point in time.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then one other question, but this will be -- you're not the only company, but this will be the sixth year out of 7 that your gross margins are supposed to go down. I appreciate we're in a very difficult long-term cost environment, but how should you and how should we think about your gross margin long-term going forward, right? Is there an opportunity for Kellogg to start growing this line again if inflation flattens out? Or is there something more structural that I guess will lead to some softness, maybe some declines going forward, again on a long-term basis, even if commodities become less volatile? And I'm thinking excluding Pringles here. I know that throws a wrench in the machine a little bit.","John A. Bryant","Ken, I think there's no structural reason why we can't grow our gross margin. So we can absolutely grow our gross margin in the future. Our long-term metrics are for sales growth of around 3% to 4%. We think we can grow gross profit dollars faster than that. That means you're going to get gross margin expansion, and then we put back in the brand-building investment and drive mid-single-digit operating profit growth. So structurally, we can do it. We have struggled in the last few years with hyper-commodity inflationary environment and with having to invest back in our supply chain. But we did this for many years across the 2000s and we believe with the right economic environment, we can do it again.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is David Driscoll with Citi Investment.","Cornell Burnette","This is Cornell Burnette on the line with a question for David. I just wanted to focus back on Europe here, and it seems that many of the issues that really negatively impacted the first quarter look like they're set to abate, at least when we get to the second half of the year. In other words, I think you'll be lapping a lot of the pricing that you took last year. You should have easier comps, as you mentioned, on the continent and then overall, you seem to have much more of your innovation weighted towards the second half. So with that in mind, is it possible that second half volumes in Europe can stabilize? Or are there still some issues that may prevent you from doing that?","John A. Bryant","I'd rather not get into volume projections at a segment level, but I think your basic thesis is right. I think we're going to have -- continue to have some pressure in Q2, for it takes time to turn these businesses around. But we do expect better performance in the back half. And I think to say we could stabilize Europe in the back half, that would certainly be our goal.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little more -- the exact way about how costs are going to flow through this year. Because clearly, it seems to me that spot costs have fallen fairly precipitously and you're just reporting your quarter here where gross profits are sort of flat on what looks like 4.4% pricing. So I know we're lapping a little bit of pricing and I know you certainly want to -- have some investment needs, but can you just walk us through how you're going to time investment needs with what presumably has to be a pretty big impact, if we're even able to hold flat pricing out from these cost declines, versus where they're coming through on the income statement right now?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, Jonathan. Well, let me take the cost piece first. So we've talked about cost inflation of approximately 7%. And we're seeing probably 0.5 points to 1 point more in the front half of the year and 0.5 points to a 1 point less in the back half of the year. So we are seeing more commodity inflation in the front half and that's because of the positions that we take over the course of a year related to commodity hedging. In terms of our investment structure, I suspect you're referring to brand-building investment. You'll see that start to ramp up a little bit in the second quarter, but more towards the back end -- back half of the year.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and maybe if I could get just one follow-up, Ron. So you're talking, say, 0.5% down from there. So let's call it 5 -- plus 5% year-over-year expected cost. I mean, how far do you guys usually hedge out? Because if I look at corn or wheat or any of the big inputs, and maybe something you're buying that I don't know about, but it seems to me like it indicates they're all down pretty measurably on a year-over-year basis. At some point, that would have to flow through even this year, and -- unless it's your practice to hedge out 12 months or more.","Ronald L. Dissinger","We hedge out generally not more than 12 months. So it really is more a factor of lapping our positions that we took for the front half of 2011, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Oh, I see. So you hedged advantageously last...","Ronald L. Dissinger","That's correct.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to a couple of questions before, take a step kind of off, I guess, to like almost 30,000 feet. Just, if I looked at the industry views, and it's not just Kellogg, that volumes pretty much have been declining for a while now, kind of coincidental with the financial crisis, but almost like you're -- do you think your consumer is changing? And kind of the traditional playbook that's behind these brands, innovate and things will be okay -- do you think the playbook is a little bit changing and we need to do something a little bit more radical to follow our consumer? I'd like your take on that, please.","John A. Bryant","Well, I think there's a couple of things that have been weighing on our volume over the last few years. One is high level of commodity inflation, which has required an abnormally high level of inflation -- of pricing, I should say. And that's, obviously, adversely impacted us from a volume perspective. In addition, if you go back to 2009, 2010, we had meaningfully lower innovation levels as a company, which are going to start to ramp up in 2011 and 2012. That's also weighed on our volume performance as well. I believe if you go forward here, at the end of the day, if you provide great products to consumers, you engage them through outstanding advertising, you'll absolutely bring those consumers into your portfolio and we can drive volume growth as a company. If we can get to a normal inflationary cycle, so we're taking a normal level of pricing, I believe we can generate that 3% to 4% sales growth from a combination of volume, price and mix. I recognize the volume performance has been below where we want it to be for the last few years. I don't believe there's a change in the structural nature of the business or a change in fundamental consumer behavior. I think it just reflects the dynamic that we've been going through over the last 3 or 4 years.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. I mean, one observation I'd make is some places in the consumer [indiscernible] vertical including home vertical, where actually it's growing pretty rapidly, including volume. Second question, I just want to make sure I understood what's going on in North America specifically. Did you say it was the cadence in the quarter on the volume was improving? Or was it -- or wasn't, and I wasn't sure I caught that. My [indiscernible] breaking up at that point. That's my last questions.","John A. Bryant","Maybe the -- you can see within the measured channel data that the volume consumption on our business was improving as we went through the first quarter. So I think talking about that one segment specifically, our volume was doing well. I think we are generally seeing the volume trends improving in the business as we go through the year.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So you see that happening through the year and it -- in the measured channel, it happened overall in the business as it happened. And then the second question would be, what's the degree here? Are we really ramping up? And could we break even? Or is that just not going to happen?","John A. Bryant","I think if you look at our full year guidance this year, we have around 2% to 3% sales growth, which implies volume is going to be down 1% or 2% on the year. So we're not expecting volume to bounce back, but nor are we expecting 3% to 4% volume declines for the year.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I want to ask you, John, in relation to some of the volume weakness that you're seeing, and I just obviously heard your answer and your discussion on the call about improving through the year and maybe some elasticity, but is there a need in the short run to be a little more promotional in certain businesses, be it in the U.S. or I guess, to a larger degree in Europe, to try and stabilize volume versus pricing to get that piece of business improved?","John A. Bryant","Chris, we have looked at the performance of our first quarter business and have looked at where we've had some more price elasticity than we expected, and we've tweaked our plans as you'd expect us to do. I don't think that's going to substantially change our price realization as a company. I think it's just us reacting to the environment in which we're operating and ensuring that the right pressure against the brands that are suffering a little bit more.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just a bit of a follow-on to an earlier question. I guess, if -- from the comments you've made on the call today, I don't think I'm still clear on where you have to invest. Obviously, Europe and the U.S., but it sounds like in Europe, you're actually not getting the return on the investment dollar. So am I just misunderstanding the way you're looking at that? But how is the investment -- where is the investment going this year, I guess, to benefit your revenue growth?","John A. Bryant","Our intention is to grow brand building at or above the rate of sales growth. So it is some investment, but I wouldn't suggest that it's a massive level of investment. That investment can go into a number of places. We're very excited about our growth potential in Latin America, in Asia, expanding out some of the emerging market businesses. So I'm not sure you should look to -- for us to invest behind where we might be having some issues, so much as invest behind where we think our future growth can come from.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, do you still have that new product goal of around $900 million? Is that still a good number to use for new product opportunities this year?","John A. Bryant","We are still tracking to $900 million of launches this year.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I just have 2 quick questions. Are you -- I guess the first question is, could you provide or will you provide and do you expect to provide in the future just the volume price breakout that you've always done per geography segment? Or is that -- should we not expect that going forward?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, we will make commentary within our Q when it comes out on the drivers of sales performance, Rob. So take a look at the Q and that should provide you with more information.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, perfect. And then the other more housekeeping question was just on -- I didn't hear anyone mention this, I don't think. It was just the -- it looked like it was about a $40-million benefit in net expense, the other income and interest expense year-over-year, which winds up being about $0.08 or so, $0.08 or $0.09. And I didn't -- I don't think you talked about it in the prepared remarks. So could you just add a little color, unless I've completely missed something, as to why there is a $13-million benefit in other income?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Be happy to. First of all, and probably the most significant item, is we get about $0.05 of benefit associated with interest rate hedges we placed in association with the Pringles debt that we intend to take. So that's the biggest factor. We did have some other discrete benefits in the first quarter, as well, in other income and expense. It's important to note also though that if you look at tax, for example, we're lapping some discrete benefits in tax for the first quarter. So if I look at other income, expense and tax, wrap all those together, we're relatively neutral. The $0.05 of benefit from the interest rate hedges is really the key benefit below the line.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, so then all of that $0.05 is below the line. There's nothing that would be inclusive within COGS, that I should...","Ronald L. Dissinger","That is correct. Yes.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the health of the Kashi brand? I just noticed that in your innovation, I haven't seen much, at least on the grain snacks or cereal side. You're doing more in frozen. But this used to be a real growth driver of the company. Has that leveled off? And then maybe talk about Special K also. Is that making up for some of the difference?","John A. Bryant","Kashi, as we discussed before, had a difficult time during the deep element of the recession. The good news is in the first quarter, we actually saw very good growth from Kashi. It was up mid-single-digits and Bear Naked was up double digits. So the whole natural adult-oriented cereal segment, we think, is well positioned for long-term growth and we're excited about that business. There is some new innovation there on cereal and on wholesome snacks, and we believe we can continue to grow that business over time. So we feel good there. On Special K, I think one element of our weakness in the first quarter was actually Special K. We had a very good New Year's resolution program as a company. However, within that New Year's resolution event, we did a multi-category event. We saw a very good lift on Special K Cracker Chips and so on, but we didn't feature cereal quite essentially in that program this year as we have in the past. And so our Special K cereal didn't do quite as well. And so that did weigh a little bit on our first quarter results.","Operator","Our final question for today will be Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So if we assume that the revised guidance entails -- potentially entails a change or a haircut to what you may have initially planned for incentive compensation for 2012, how should we think about the risk that if the business then performs to plan in 2013, this could create a headwind similar to, but maybe not at the same magnitude of what you faced in 2011?","John A. Bryant","Yes, that's a great question, Matthew. We have a pay-for-performance culture as a company. And clearly, my bonus is not looking that good for 2012. Having said that, a large number of businesses are doing quite well: Latin America, Asia, frozen, specialty, Kashi, elements of the snack business. So we're not expecting anything like the 2010, 2011 dynamic, where the bonus program was cut in 2010 and caused an issue for 2011. So nothing like that is expected for this year, next year.","Operator","And again, that does conclude our time for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Simon Burton","Okay, everybody, thanks very much for joining us. We'll be available, obviously, throughout the rest of the day and the days to come. We look forward to talking to you then. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may disconnect at this time."],"12719":["Kellogg (NYSE:K) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  1, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Simon Burton - Executive Officer of Snacks business unit","John A.

Welcome to the Kellogg Company Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thank you, Sean. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter 2012 results. I'm joined by John Bryant, our President and CEO; Ron Dissinger, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Denholm, President of our U.S. Morning Foods business. Intention is to highlight different business units periodically and David is here to discuss our U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts businesses in a little more detail.","Also, I just wanted to mention, for those of you don't know, they will be hosting a day of presentations for analysts and investors in Chicago on November 8. Please contact us if you'd like to attend and haven't yet registered.","The press release and slides to support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggscompany.com. As you're aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg company's future performance, including earnings per share, sales, profit, cash flow, brand building, cost, investments and the integration of Pringles, are all forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, November 5. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. Now, I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I know the recent storm has had an impact on many of you. I hope that you and your families are safe.","Turning to our third quarter results. We're pleased that our underlying performance in the third quarter was broadly in line with expectations and reflects continued progress. Internal net sales growth was almost 3%, the high end of our guidance for the full year. As expected, our top line growth has been improving sequentially as we've progressed through the year. Consolidated internal operating profit would have also increased in the quarter were it not for the impact of the Mini-Wheats recall, which I'll discuss in more detail in a minute. And as with sales growth, we've seen some sequential improvement in underlying operating profit during the year, particularly in North America.","Underlying operating results in North America were very strong as we saw a significant improvement in the Cereal business. We continue to see strong performance from Pop-Tarts, Specialty Channels and the Frozen Foods business.","We also saw some additional improvement in the European business. In the U.K., we've seen benefits from better commercial programs and strong innovation. As a consequence, we've posted sales growth in both Cereal and Snacks in the quarter in the U.K. As we've discussed before, the Continental European business continues to be under pressure due to economic conditions where we've taken actions and have seen some early signs that they're having an effect. Underlying sales growth was strong in both Asia Pacific and Latin America and, as we mentioned on our last call, we increased our investment in brand building to double-digit rate in both regions.","Now, I'd like to address the Mini-Wheats recall of a few weeks ago. Obviously, we never want to have a recall. But as you know, these things do happen periodically in our industry. We reacted quickly and effectively to the situation. I remain confident that we have turned the corner in our supply chain over the last 2 years, that we have proactively identified and addressed the challenges. This places us in a much stronger position to avoid and mitigate these issues in the future.","Let's turn to Slide 4 in a brief update regarding Pringles. As you know, we have seen better operating performance from Pringles than we expected. In fact, Pringles in North America posted organic sales growth of 10% in the third quarter. This a testament to the strength of the brand and the team that's running the business. We're very pleased that we've been able to attract many of the Pringles employees to Kellogg. They're excited to become part of a large food company and we're pleased to be gaining such energized and knowledgeable people.","And finally, the integration continues to go well. The teams running the integration are doing a great job. They've executed well in North America and have already seen some benefit and we're currently in the middle of the  integration in Europe. So we're excited about the potential of this iconic global brand and as you might imagine, we'll give you more detail in next week's Investor Day.","And now, let me turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial performance.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides a summary of our quarterly and year-to-date financial results. We posted reported revenue growth of 12.3% in the quarter and internal sales, excluding the impact of Pringles, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased by 2.8%. Reported operating profit increased by 3.2%. Internal operating profit decreased by 4.9% in the third quarter. This included investment in brand building that increased at a high single-digit rate. It also included the impact of the recall. Excluding that impact, internal operating profit would have increased by approximately 1%, so the recall is approximately a 6-point headwind to operating profit in the quarter. Reported earnings per share were $0.82 in the third quarter, up 2.5% and in line with our expectations but this includes $0.04 of integration costs, so earnings per share, excluding integration costs, were $0.86, up 7.5%. As we mentioned a few weeks ago, good performance from Pringles and certain below-the-line items, including lower-than-expected share dilution, offset the $0.06 impact of the recall on EPS in the third quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 and details of third quarter sales growth. As I mentioned, reported sales increased by 12.3% and internal net sales increased by 2.8%. Volumes increased slightly in the quarter, reflecting the improving trends we've seen as we progressed through the year, particularly in North America. We also continued to see both positive price and mix improvements, which was up 2.7 points in the quarter. As was the case last quarter, we increased internal sales in the quarter globally across Cereal, Snacks and our Specialty and Frozen businesses. Pringles added more than 11 points to overall reported sales growth in the quarter and currency reduced overall growth by 1.6 points.","Slide 7 shows our gross profit performance. Reported gross profit was $1.4 billion in the third quarter, up nearly 7% but gross margin was lower by 190 basis points. Gross margin was impacted by continued commodity inflation in the quarter. In addition, margin was reduced approximately 60 basis points by the recall. Also, we owned Pringles for the entirety of the third quarter and as you know, Pringles has a lower gross margin than the company's average. This had a dilutive effect on the company's gross margin of approximately 40 basis points. Having said that, we have developed and are already implementing initiatives to increase the Pringles margins over time.","Now let's look at Slide 8 and details of our investment in brand building. As you can see on the chart, investment increased significantly in the quarter. Our plans were always for our investment to be weighted to the second half of the year and this has certainly turned out to be the case. This activity has supported innovations launched since midyear, various new commercial programs and activities such as the Olympics. And as you can see on the chart, we expect that investment in the fourth quarter will also be higher than during the fourth quarter of last year.","We continue to expect that investment in brand building for the year will increase at a rate equal to or greater than sales growth. It is worth noting that we're planning this increase, including the efficiencies we've been able to realize this year. And of course, we'll continue to develop plans for efficiencies next year as well.","Slide 9 shows the internal operating performance for each of the regions. As I mentioned earlier, internal operating profit for the total company decreased by 4.9% in the quarter. North America's internal operating profit decreased by 1.6% in the quarter. While sales growth was strong, the business increased its investment in brand building by 10%. In addition, commodity inflation had a significant impact as did the recall. In fact, without the recall, North America's operating profit would have increased by more than 6%.","Europe's internal operating profit declined by 7.7% in the quarter. This was the result of the difficult economic environment in the region. However, these results were broadly in, line with our guidance and represent a significant sequential improvement from the first 2 quarters of the year.","While commodity inflation and a double-digit increase in investment in brand building had an impact on the quarter's operating profit in Latin America, we also worked hard to reduce trade inventory levels in Mexico. As a result of all 3 of these items, Latin America's internal operating profit decreased by approximately 17% in the quarter. Outside of Mexico, the region posted double-digit operating profit growth.","Finally, internal operating profit in Asia Pacific was 3% lower year-over-year. While sales growth was strong, the business also increased its investment in brand building at a double-digit rate. We have improved commercial plans in Australia and has started to show in the third quarter's results.","Slide 10 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of more than $236 million versus the comparable period last year. Remember, this year's amount includes the working capital benefit we got as a result of the Pringles' acquisition. Year-to-date capital spending was $262 million or 2.5% of sales. Our capital spending is more back-end weighted, consistent with our investment profile in prior years and it does include investment in Pringles. We invested at a rate greater than our long-term targets last year and we now expect to invest at a rate of approximately 4% of net sales this year or at the low end of our previous guidance range of 4% to 5% and at the high-end of our long-term range of 3% to 4%.","And consistent with our plan, we didn't purchase any shares during the quarter. Instead, we have reduced our levels of debt by approximately $350 million. Finally, we still expect cash flow to be in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range for the full year. While we are already at $1.1 billion, the timing of our capital spending will impact the fourth quarter results. Based upon our year-to-date performance and dependent upon timing of cash around year end, we could be at the high-end of our range.","You can see on Slide 11 that our guidance for 2012 net sales and earnings per share remains unchanged, but the recall had an impact on guidance for internal operating profit. Internal sales and operating profit guidance continues to exclude the impact of Pringles. Our earnings per share guidance includes the expected accretion and one-time costs related to the acquisition. Our expectations for full year internal sales growth remain unchanged at 2% to 3%, consistent with the improving trends we've seen. Our estimates for cost inflation of 7% and cost savings of slightly greater than 3% are consistent with previous guidance. Gross margin is expected to decline by a little more than 150 basis points. Pringles will dilute gross margin by approximately 40 basis points and the recall has impacted full year gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. So our estimate is that underlying gross margin will be down around 100 basis points. Internal operating profit is now expected to be down by between 4% and 6% due to the cost of the recall. We expect interest expense to be approximately $260 million, including the cost of debt issued to acquire Pringles and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 29%.","And as we told you a few weeks ago, our estimate for reported earnings per share has not changed. Better-than-expected performance in the Pringles business, lower than planned share dilution and better-than-expected performance on some below-the-line items has allowed us to maintain our earnings per share guidance. An earnings per share walk has been included in the slide appendix for your reference.","And finally, we had intended to give you guidance for 2013 on the fourth quarter conference call scheduled for early February of next year. However, as we're holding our Investor Day in a week, we'll give you a high level first look at next year's sales and earnings guidance at that time. Obviously then, we'll give you additional information on the fourth quarter call as we had always intended.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Let's turn to Slide 12 which illustrates the internal revenue growth posted by Kellogg North America so far this year. As you can see, we have delivered good growth with the business, posting 4% internal sales growth for the second consecutive quarter.","Now, let's look at individual North American segments, starting with U.S. Snacks on Slide 13. The business posted internal net sales growth of 0.3% in the quarter. The Cracker category grew during the quarter, as did our business. It was building on strong sales growth in excess of 6% in the comparable period of last year. And Special K Cracker Chips and Cheez-It both did well in the quarter. We're also encouraged that the introduction of Special K Popcorn Chips appears to be going well and that sales seem to be mostly incremental.","Consumption in the Cookie category, as a whole, remained unchanged in the third quarter. Our performance was impacted in part by the timing of our programs, although the Keebler brand posted growth even off a 4.5% growth comparison last year. We have more to be planned for the fourth quarter as well, although we're lapping a difficult comp.","The wholesome snack business remains a focus for us and we have more activity planned for the months to come. However, of note in the quarter was a strong performance of Special K Pastry Crisps. Consumption is strong and results thus far this year have exceeded expectations. This is a product that we recently launched in the U.K. under different branding and initial results are encouraging there too. We're very pleased with the responsiveness of the Pringles business to our merchandising efforts. As I mentioned before, sales growth in North America was 10% in the third quarter.","Slide 14 shows the performance of the U.S. Specialty segment. This segment posted internal revenue growth of 5.5% in the third quarter. This was a result of strong innovation introduced during the year, including Special K Cracker Chips, 2 new Rice Krispies Treats and new Eggo products. The gains have been broad based, with year-to-date sales increasing with all major customers. In addition, the Pringles business is also doing well in the Specialty Channels. Sales have outpaced our expectations in these channels as we're gaining points of distribution.","Now, let's turn to Slide 15 in the North America Other segment, which posted sales growth of more than 5% in the quarter. Within this segment, Frozen Foods posted strong sales growth. Both the frozen breakfast and Veggie Foods businesses did well. As pictured on the Slide, the recently launched Special K Flatbread Breakfast Sandwiches are off to a great start. The frozen veggie business has responded well to the advertising we began at midyear and we have more activity planned for both businesses in the fourth quarter.","Also within this segment, the Canadian business increased its share of the Cereal category by 0.5 points in the quarter, driven by our new Krave cereal, which has gained more than a share point in Canada. Also, we saw share gains in the Snack category. And Special K Cracker Chips and special K Pastry Crisps are both doing very well.","Slide 16 shows the performance of the Morning Foods and Kashi segment over the past couple of years. As you can see, this segment posted very strong growth in the third quarter. So now, I'd like to hand it over to David Denholm, the Head of our U.S. Morning Foods segment for a more detailed discussion of this business.","David Denholm","Thanks, John. Now, let's turn to Slide 18 and our quarterly performance. As you can see, the Morning Foods and Kashi segment posted strong growth in the third quarter, after a weaker-than-expected start to the year. The Cereal category responds to brand building, innovation and nutrition. And we've seen the benefit of our actions as we've progressed through the year.","For Cereal, the volume declines that we experienced early in the year in response to previous price increases certainly had the most significant impact in the first 2 quarters, although obviously, the situation has improved sequentially, as pricing moderated as we've moved through the year.","Slide 19 shows the shipments and market share performance of our Cereal business. The business posted growth of almost 6%, driven by innovation, a strong increase in the level of brand building and a relatively easier shipment comp. So while our inventories are in good shape this year and are in line with average levels, the year ago comp helped shipment growth exceed consumption in the quarter.","The Slide also shows our xAOC category share performance in the Cereal category in the 12-week period ended 1 October. As you can see, our Cereal business posted category share gains of 0.3 points, building on good gains in the comparable period of last year, and we continue to post share gains in early October behind increased investment in brand building.","Slide 20 outlines some highlights from the quarter and how well our business responds to brand building, the execution of big events and innovation. We increased investment in brand building at a double digit rate in the quarter with strong support behind key brands, such as Frosted Flakes, Mini-Wheats and Special K.","We also continue to increase the level of investments in Hispanic-oriented advertising and we are seeing an increasingly positive response. We had a successful back-to-school promotion with Scholastic to provide free books to school children. The execution of our Olympic program was fully integrated across the path to purchase, which included a heavy digital component and a PR program that delivered approximately 1 billion impressions. In fact, it was the largest PR program in the history of the Kellogg company.","Our cereal innovation strategy involves having the right level of pressure each year while working to improve the stickiness of our launches. During Q3, we saw the benefit of this as our innovation continued to build momentum.","Turning to Slide 21, you'll see that our share of innovation is now 50% of the category, with the next biggest competitor at 35%. Our innovation has been performing well this year and Krave, which we introduced in January, continues to hold almost a share point of the category. That represents a strong start for just 2 SKUs and shows that both trial and repeat have been strong since introduction. In addition, we relaunched Special K Protein at midyear to appeal to those consumers looking for increased protein in their diet. Although it's early, we are pleased with the results so far, as this innovation has also been well received and trial rates have been strong. And we have a strong lineup of introductions planned for 2013, including Special K Chocolate Strawberry, Cinnamon Jack's, Mini-Wheats Crunch and Scooby Doo. Kashi innovation will focus on expanding the brands all-family offerings with the launch of Berry Fruitful. 2 SKUs of Bear Naked Fit will also be launched.","The Morning Foods business unit also includes the Pop-Tarts brand, which has annual sales of more than $0.5 billion. Slide 22 highlights the 30 years of continuous growth posted by Pop-Tarts. This truly is an iconic brand with good economics supported by strong execution.","Slide 23 shows the quarterly performance of the Pop-Tarts business. And as you can see, the business also had a very good quarter, posting sales growth of more than 6% and increasing share by 0.5 point. This gain was driven by strong retail execution, brand building behind the Crazy Good advertising campaign and programs such as the summer concert tour.","Slide 24 highlights our 84% share of the Toaster Pastry category. Our winning formula for this brand is simple. We have breakthrough advertising, including social media, we drive strong innovation and we ensure that we win in-store every day. Our next big innovation is 2 SKUs of oatmeal delights which will be launched nationally in January. We drive a lot of retail activation via seasonal events, such as our recently launched college football branded Pop-Tarts, which were a big success. And as you can imagine, we also have strong demand for our pumpkin pie flavor during the fall season. So our Pop-Tarts business is in great shape and we have good visibility into our future growth.","Now, let's turn to Slide 25 for a summary. We're excited about the long-term potential of our business. We have excellent share positions in the categories in which we compete. We have increased our focus on health and wellness and we have brands that play naturally in those areas, such as Special K and Kashi. And we have a number of iconic brands that consumers love and that respond to both brand building and the introduction of innovation, 2 of our strengths. And finally, we have a great team. They've done a lot of work this year and I'd like to thank them for all the effort and dedication. So we're optimistic about the future and the great potential of our brands and our businesses.","And with that, I would like to turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, David. Now, let's turn to Slide 26 and the performance of our international businesses so far this year. As you can see, after a difficult start to the year, primarily in Europe, the International business has posted progressive improvement as it moved through the year. As we told you last quarter, we've done a lot of work in Europe to improve the business and strengthen our organization and we're investing for future growth in both Latin America and Asia Pacific.","Now, if you'll turn to Slide 27, you'll see some more detail regarding our International businesses. The European business continued to improve sequentially in the third quarter. The U.K. business posted sales growth in both Cereal and Snacks as a result of much better commercial plans, tactical pricing actions on some SKUs and improved innovation. Special K Biscuit Moments, Nutri-Grain Breakfast Biscuits and Special K Cracker Crisps have been launched in the U.K. and all are off to a good start.","On the continent, sales in France increased and we saw early signs of improvement from the relaunch of Special K in Italy and Spain. However, as you've heard from other manufacturers, Southern Europe continues to be a difficult environment and we know it will take some time to improve. So due to this, we remain cautious on Europe as we look into 2013.","The Latin American business posted growth of 4% in the quarter. As we said previously, we have worked aggressively to lower trade inventories in Mexico in the quarter, which led to lower shipments, although consumption in Mexico increased in the quarter. A part of this difference affects timing between the third and fourth quarters.","In addition, the other businesses in the region are performing strongly and posted double-digit sales growth. We increased Latin America's investment in brand building at a double-digit rate in the third quarter. And we've also launched Special K Cracker Chips and Special K Crisps in the region as well as Choco Krispies Pops and Special K Chocolate in certain geographies and all are doing well.","The Asia Pacific business had a strong quarter, posting 7% sales growth. And as we mentioned, we increased brand building during the quarter at a double-digit rate. The Australian business improved as new advertising started to have an impact and innovation on All-Bran, Be Natural and Sultana Bran all contributed to growth. Also in the region, India and South Africa performed well as a result of innovation and continued penetration gains.","Now, let's turn to Slide 28 and the summary. Sales growth continued to improve in the third quarter as we expected and was in line with our expectations for the full year. North America posted strong top-line growth as the Cereal, Pop-Tarts, Frozen Foods and Specialty channel businesses all did well. Underlying profit growth, adjusted for the recall, was also strong. Europe remains a difficult environment, but we have seen some early signs of improvement. For example, the U.K. performed much better as a result of improved commercial plans and innovation. We increased our investment in our brands at a high single digit rate in the third quarter, and the Asia Pacific and Latin American businesses increased their investment in brand building at a double digit rate. We saw a better performance than we expected from the Pringles business.","All in all, it was a good quarter and I'd like to thank all our employees for their efforts around the world. With that, I'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Baumgartner Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Thinking about your JV with Wilmar, there wasn't anything in the press release and the PowerPoint here. Wondering if you can touch on your thought process in building the relationship? What are your expectations there? What are some of the opportunities Wilmar affords, anything Navigable didn't? And what might the lingering headwinds still be in China distribution, even with Wilmar?","John A. Bryant","Thank you, John. We're excited about the Wilmar joint venture and we'll actually talk more about that next week at Day at K. But the reason we're so excited about Wilmar, it is roughly the third largest consumer goods company in China. It has a tremendous infrastructure across that market and they're very excited as are we in the potential growth of the category in China. The category today, the Cereal category, is relatively small but it is growing rapidly at strong double-digit rate. And so we believe that together, we're better positioned to unlock that opportunity. If you go back to the Navigable business, that was a low-margin cookie business in China that was not really helping us build out our infrastructure, or really set ourselves up for the future. So we're excited about China, both from a Cereal perspective as well as a Snacks perspective, and we believe that Wilmar is extremely well positioned to help us make that a reality.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question on Pringles. So you gave original accretion guidance back when you closed the deal, but since then, you've had a chance to do the purchase price allocation. And according to the best estimates that we can make, amortization expense looks like it's going to be a lot lower. And then as you mentioned in your prepared script, John, the sales growth also looks to be much better than anything you would've expected on day 1. So can you update us on the accretion expectation in '12 and in '13 from the Pringles deal?","Ronald L. Dissinger","David, this is Ron. I'd be happy to give you an update on the expectation for 2012. We haven't provided 2013 details yet. But we've moved the accretion expectations from $0.08 to $0.10, which is what we communicated before, to $0.11 to $0.13, so -- and we've got about $0.03 better. We are seeing stronger sales performance than we previously expected. And in addition, we're seeing better performance come through our supply chain. We've been able to improve throughputs in our supply chain and done some other things that have improved our cost structure. In terms of the amortization and the balance sheet valuations, frankly David, we're still working through that. So you may see a low level of amortization expense come through for now, but we're still working through that as we go through the end of the year.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question. It's just on upfront costs. I think your original guidance was for upfront charges to be approximately the same as last year. But as of the third quarter and year-to-date results, you're running behind last year. Are you going to get a big -- a fairly big upfront number in the fourth quarter?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We are, David. So as we look at the fourth quarter, we'll certainly have more upfront costs and better than the fourth quarter than we did last year. That's correct.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And it's flat, the total number is flat year-on-year?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Still investing at similar levels. It could be in the range of $0.10 to $0.12, consistent with prior years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Jefferies.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to understand a little bit of the difference between what's going on with the Mini-Wheats recall and some of the issues you saw over the last couple of years. That'll be my first question.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Scott. I think we've made some great progress in our supply chain over the last few years. We've made significant investments, as we mentioned last year, adding people back into the facilities, improving certain core processes within the facilities and we're seeing a much better performance out of our supply chain. We are very disappointed by this latest event. It was a failure in a piece of equipment. We've been using that sort of equipment for 20 years in this facility and it's the first time we've seen a failure like this. But I think our recent investments have enabled us to identify the issue quickly, to respond to it and I think the company did a great job of very effectively and efficiently dealing with the situation. We have -- Alistair Hirst is our Head of Supply Chain who will be talking about some of the great progress we've made at Day at K next week. But we do believe that we have definitely made progress in the supply chain. I think this is a unique issue that we had more recently and I believe the investments we've made will help us mitigate and reduce the probability of these sorts of events in the future.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So you don't think it's part of a systemic issue? You think it's more of a little bit of maybe a bad luck with a piece of equipment, not maybe -- that maintenance wasn't done on there or anything like that? You think it's more a little bit of a bad luck situation?","John A. Bryant","Yes, I think it's really unfortunate. Clearly, Our goal is to avoid these things happening in the future.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then my second question really goes to the brand building. This is 2-part. I wondered if you could kind of delve into how those funds, the extra funds are being spent, number one. And then number two is, I'm playing a little bit of a devil's advocate. It seems like clearly, you're turning the tide on sales, although it seems to be costing you a lot of money in North America that you also see in some other markets. When did that period of extra investment or maybe more of a flow through to the bottom line? So kind of a two-part question then I'll yield.","Ronald L. Dissinger","I think if you look at brand building and what we're doing this year, we're investing our brand building in the areas where we're expecting future growth. So we're investing behind Asia Pacific and Latin America and you saw the double-digit increases in brand building in the third quarter. And you'll see a continued investment in those regions. A part of our long-term model is to increase brand building at or above the rate of sales growth and we're going to do that this year and we expect to do that in the future. At the same time, we're always looking to drive efficiency. We've seen a big move towards digital. We're saving money on nonworking cost within the advertising line. So we have a series of efficiency programs there as well, but at our heart, we are a branded food business. We believe it's what enables us to succeed. It's part of our sustainable growth model and I would expect us to continue to invest in brand building in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 questions on the phasing of costs and sort of how that plays into results during the second half of the year. I guess in recent quarters, you've given a sense of how the phasing of supply chain spending was impacting year-on-year operating profit growth and I know the level of investment in the third quarter of 2011 was particularly high. I was just wondering how much the flighting of that spend impacted this quarter's results. And then just with respect to the $0.06 per share recall impact, sort of in compensating for those expenses during the quarter, was there any degree of sort of shifting innovation, planned brand building spend from 3Q into 4Q?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Let me take the phasing of the supply chain cost first. We did invest more in the back half of last year. We are lapping that impact this year and we did see that benefit come through. Having said that, as we communicated on the second quarter call, we are seeing higher commodity costs over the back half of the year. So we're seeing more commodity inflation and that's had an impact on our inflation, not just in the third quarter, but it will in the fourth quarter as well. We still do expect our input inflation to be at the rate of 7%. It might be a little bit above that. In terms of the impact of the recall and any R&D investment associated with that, that had no impact whatsoever.","John A. Bryant","And just to build on that, remember the recall occurred in early October. It was actually a subsequent event to the quarter itself. So our actual spend and everything was in place. We were in the process of closing the quarter when the event occurred.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Feeney with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Ron, I wanted to ask about the phasing of cost more specifically as we look through the next year. If costs stay where they are right now, and I understand they've increased recently, do you -- how much would you expect -- do you expect to -- the need to take new pricing in the marketplace in North America at some point in the next 6 months given where costs are today?","Ronald L. Dissinger","John, as you know, we don't comment on perspective price increases. We have said in the past that we expect an inflationary environment in 2013. We haven't yet discussed the phasing. One thing I would say though is at this point in time, you'd expect us to be taking hedge positions and we are in a hedge position, very similar to where we were at this time last year, which is about 40% to 50% hedged.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess I was very impressed at the share of innovation that you've talked about on your slide presentation. Looking forward into next year, I mean, do you -- does that affect pricing plans at all that you took significant innovation? How does that typically work? Is that -- in this case, SKU pricing higher or lower, do you think, particularly in the Cereal -- ready-to-eat Cereal business the past few months?","John A. Bryant","I think innovation, at a very macro level, is a driver more of volume than any pricing decisions that are out there. So we expect next year to have even more innovation at a total company level than what we had this year and innovation's clearly a core driver of our success.","David Denholm","Just building on John's comment and talking specifically about Cereal, we have good visibility into our innovation pipeline. We have strong ideas and we're looking forward to executing a stronger plan next year.","John A. Bryant","And in general, I'd say that the innovation drives positive mix and in fact, in this quarter, we saw a positive mix coming out of innovation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ron, I've got a couple of questions, kind of following up on Dave Driscoll's, because I'm not sure that we got full kind of Pringles impact. So I see on Slide 32, in the appendix, that you took the Pringles accretion up $0.03. But your free cash flow generation is better than you thought and you said you paid down some debt. So the impact of that, plus less dilution on the share base, wouldn't that make, all in, Pringles actually more accretive than what the $0.11 to $0.13 shows?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We do show the share impact as well on that same slide. And remember, we were saying before that shares might be an impact of $0.07 to $0.08. We now think it's $0.05. So we picked up $0.02 to $0.03 there. And then the operating income -- impact of Pringles is giving us another $0.03 of benefit, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then your interest cost is lower than you thought, right?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Our interest costs, Eric, is very comparable to what we previously expected.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how about on the currency side?","Ronald L. Dissinger","The currency isn't too far off. Right now, we're saying $0.05 of currency impact and over the course of this year, as we've spoken to you, it's been anywhere from $0.04 to $0.06 of impact.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and so -- then just following up on the free cash flow comment, and I wasn't really sure if I followed the benefit of working capital associated with Pringles and why that's making the free cash flow better. What does that mean?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, Eric. Be happy to elaborate on that. And we've talked about this before. Basically, when we acquired the Pringles business, we picked up a working capital benefit based on the way that the deal was structured. And we talked about that as being in the range of anywhere from $140 million to $150 million worth of benefit. We essentially picked up virtually no liabilities, only a few and no payables. So we've seen that benefit come through over the course of some in June and through the third quarter as well. So we're getting essentially a one-time benefit to our cash flow here that you're seeing in the year-to-date $1.1 billion.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question and I'll pass it on and see you next week, but do you expect if you're towards the high end of the free cash flow range, with CapEx being lower, plus this one-time benefit. Do you see making a pension contribution that could knock the free cash flow down?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We haven't discussed any pension contributions at this point in time, Eric. And right now, we're in good funding positions on our pension plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have more of a modeling question. On Cereal, if you look at, I think, it was Slide 16 that the cereals sales were pretty stable sequentially first, second and third quarter of this year. But when you look at fourth quarter last year, they dropped off quite a bit. And I want to know, should we expect the same kind of seasonal impact in fourth quarter for Morning Foods? Or is it going to be different this time? And then I have another question on the interest expense. I guess I don't quite get the interest expense guidance.","David Denholm","It's David here. There is seasonality in the Cereal category and that's relatively consistent over time. We have increased our investment in brand building versus last year and we do have a stronger innovation in the marketplace. So we've got off to a strong start in October and are well positioned in Q4.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, but David, do you -- should we expect the same kind of seasonality that you typically have? Was fourth quarter seasonality last year typical or was that a steeper drop-off than normal?","David Denholm","Robert, last year's seasonality was typical.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Typical, okay. And then I guess on the interest expense, $260 million -- I think that kind of implies like something like in the 60s for quarterly interest expense and fourth quarter this year. Ron, is that a good run rate to use going forward, like $65 million or so per quarter?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We haven't communicated guidance for 2013 at this point in time. Of course, Rob, you'd expect us we're paying down our debt that our interest cost will come down over time.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But it is a -- you are guiding to sequentially lower fourth quarter interest expense, is that correct?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, we're guiding to lower interest expense in the fourth quarter, $260 million for the full year, Rob, so lower than the third quarter.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is this a lot? You said it's the same as what you expected but again, I was modeling something very different. So have you communicated $260 million before or is this new?","Ronald L. Dissinger","I don't know that the range came up previously, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the organic growth in Pringles in North America, in particular where you saw, I think, you said double-digit growth. And I think you commented that it was incremental merchandising but I just was wondering if there was incremental distribution into new channels since you've purchased the business or what would account for that significant growth in that business?","John A. Bryant","Yes, Dianne and the answer is both. We saw additional merchandising opportunities in the third quarter in the U.S. We're able to leverage some of our very strong relationships across some key customers and we achieved some placements that business had not historically been able to achieve. And so I think you saw a very strong response from that activity. In addition to that, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, the Specialty Channels have also seen some very strong growth and we've been gaining some distribution in those channels also. If I think back to the Keebler acquisition, the part of the Keebler acquisition has surprised us positively, was the Foodservice business, when the 2 businesses came together. I suspect, on this acquisition, the Specialty Channels will be upward surprise as these 2 businesses come together.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you just define for me what you would include in the Specialty Channels?","John A. Bryant","Convenience, vending, dollar as well as Foodservice itself.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask quickly on the trade deload in Mexico and that impact on the Latin American business. Are you -- are there any other areas globally where you are concerned that, that might be a factor in the future, for instance, because of the slower growth that we've seen, particularly in continental Europe? How do you feel about where your inventory levels are either internally or in the trade?","John A. Bryant","I think we're in good position from an inventory perspective, particularly if you think about Continental Europe and the need for European retailers to drive their cash flow very aggressively. I think what's happened in Mexico, we're talking before about the seasonality of the Cereal category, and the seasonality in trade inventory as well. What happens is early in the year, we bring out innovations, cereal inventory grows through the year and then as retailers get ready for the holiday season at the end of the year, they pull back on cereal inventory and build up on other holiday season-type inventories. What's happened in Mexico is that seasonality in cereal inventory is more than what we think it should be. And so what we've done in the back half of this year is we brought the inventories down more aggressively in the third quarter. That inventory reduction would normally occur in the fourth quarter, so it's a bit of a switch between those 2 quarters. Also remember, as we go into 2013, we wouldn't expect to build as much inventory in the first half of 2013, but we'll have a very easy comparison when we get to the third quarter of 2013 against this year's numbers. So we are trying to keep inventories lower. We believe lower retail inventory is actually very good thing for the company because it helps us bring our in-store activities on the shop at the same time as the advertising is on air.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question for David. You have that slide where you talked about having 50% of the Cereal category innovation. I'm curious where that level is, where that level has been for Kellogg's, let's say, in Cereals, the last couple of years. And perhaps, maybe more important, where is the overall level of innovation as you see it or measure it for the overall Cereal category today, relative to where it's been? Because there's a lot of discussion and concern out there that the category itself is in some way going to be different, i.e. slower growth going forward or just less relevant to consumers and if the structural issue versus one where -- hey, the big players just haven't done their fair share of innovating over the last couple of years combined with all the pricing. So trying to get a sense of maybe how you measure some of the metrics there to get some insight.","David Denholm","Andrew, we're very confident about the long-term prospects of the Cereal category. We see it as a low single-digit growth category. It really responds to brand building, innovation and nutrition. So in terms of innovation specifically, the 50% that we outlined today in terms of share is a higher share than Kellogg has achieved in recent years. So we have improved our end market performance from an innovation perspective. In terms of the absolute level of innovation in the category, it has been lower over the last year or 2 and we're seeing that improved and it's improved sequentially throughout the year. And as I highlighted, we have strong visibility into next year's innovation plan.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And from what you can see in the marketplace, just competitively, would you sense -- is your sense that you will get some help on the innovation front or the category will get some help others or is it just not clear yet?","David Denholm","I think the category responds to innovation from all participants and we expect there will be increased levels of innovation in the category and we model that and we then look at our pressure and the quality of our ideas and we are confident we can have a continued strong share of innovation within the category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question. I wanted to actually ask about the Kashi brand. There's been some negative publicity out there just around the brand centered on GMOs and there also seems to be some recent distribution loss of Kashi frozen products in the natural channel. I was hoping you can maybe address what's happening with that brand at a high level and then also talk about how it performed in the third quarter?","David Denholm","It's David here, Ed. Kashi is a great brand and it's very well positioned to grow in the future when you think of the changing demographics and the health and wellness trends, so we're very excited about the future of the Kashi brand. During the quarter, we did see some softness. We see that as temporary. There were 2 or 3 specific customer issues with the Kashi brand that we've been working through. We've also built plans for the future based on increased brand building and innovation. And in fact, you'll hear next week at the Day at K that we've got a 50% increase in the level of the cereal innovation behind the Kashi brand. We're also stepping up our support behind GOLEAN because there was some softness in the most recent quarter with the GOLEAN brand and we're relaunching our As Much Protein as an Egg campaign behind GOLEAN which works very hard for that brand.","John A. Bryant","If I can add on to that, I think if we look beyond cereal business, we're seeing good growth from Kashi and frozen as well which would suggest that the brand is still very strong and doing well out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just following on from Andrew's question on competitive dynamics in the U.S. Cereal segment. I think we recently heard that Post Cereals is launching their Good Morenings line at a much lower price point. I think they've got a regional test going on of 4 or 5 SKUs at the moment. And I think judging from their latest announcements, they're planning a national rollout come early 2013. Can you just give us any idea, any thoughts about what you've learned so far? Are you very confident that this is not going to have a major impact on the competitive dynamics and pricing dynamics in the Cereal segment next year? How are they doing terms of distribution? I mean, I know you can't comment about a specific brand but does seem to be potentially a bit of a change.","John A. Bryant","Alexia, the Cereal category has always been a very competitive category. It's a great category and time and time again, it responds to brand building, innovation, nutrition. I think you saw in most recent quarter that our strong Olympics campaign worked very hard for us. And in addition, the innovation that we're bringing to the marketplace is highly differentiated and our most recent innovation, Krave, which has almost a share point, has really brought something that's new, better and different to the category. Another example is adults seeking more protein. We're seeing that in our consumer tracking. Hence, we relaunched Special K Protein in the middle of this year and it's off to a fantastic start. So we will continue to play our game of brand building, innovation and nutrition messaging in the category.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then maybe as a follow-up, on the commodity outlook, many other cereal -- many other food companies have been talking about deflation or easing of commodity costs. That doesn't seem to be the case here. How are you seeing the commodity outlook as we go into the next couple of quarters, particularly on the grain side, which I thought might be getting easier, given the way that you tend to forward contract on the hedge?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, sure, Alexia. So as we said -- as I said a little earlier and on the second quarter call, we picked up some inflation in the back half associated with the grain costs going up, and that's included in our guidance, we have it managed within the earnings per share. We do expect inflation as we're moving into 2013. We haven't talked about the levels, obviously. Hedges we had from -- for 2012 will roll off and we'll have new positions coming up for 2013, but we do expect an inflationary environment. Obviously, we are going to do everything we can to drive productivity improvements to offset as much of the inflation as we possibly can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So I just had 2 questions for you, a bit of a follow-up on Alexia's question there. In the third quarter, I don't know if you can go this far Ron, but did your pricing that came through in the quarter offset cost inflation?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Our pricing was a little bit lower than cost inflation. So it didn't fully offset it. And that's why when I commented on the commodity inflation having an impact on gross margin, it's because the pricing didn't quite fully offset it.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And I guess a bit of a follow-up on Europe. If I look at this quarter, you had a fairly -- if you look at your internal sales, had a pretty similar sales performance, obviously, a little bit better sequentially but still a little soft on the volume side, you had an easier comp on the profit side, but you did have a much better profit performance overall. And I guess maybe the answer is the comp, but I was just curious about of the U.K. performance, how that improved in the quarter and the degree which that helped your profit performance overall for Europe.","John A. Bryant","Certainly, Chris, I think we're happy to see the improved performance in Europe. We're still not satisfied with where it is and we expect to see a better fourth quarter out of Europe from a top line perspective. And the U.K. certainly helped that turnaround as we look within the year. We also saw some good growth in France and some -- it's really -- the challenges for us are in southern Europe, with Spain and Italy in particular were soft. As we build for the future year we need also continue to invest back in the business to that a top line growing as well, so you'll see some of that come through in the fourth quarter. So I would expect to be -- to continue to have a profit decline in Q4 for Europe and as we go into 2013, we remain very cautious on our outlook for Europe.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Excuse me. Sean, I think that's about all we have time for?","Operator","All right. Thank you very much. Would like to close the call now?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. Thank you everybody for joining us today.

Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, we continued to make progress on our overall business transformation, which is guided by our 2020 Growth Plan and is aimed at improving top-line and bottom-line results. For instance, our biggest transformational initiative this year is our transition to warehouse distribution from direct store delivery in our U.S. Snacks business. Paul will give you an update in a moment, but we are pleased with how this is going on all fronts.","Today, we are very close to completing this ambitious and complex transition. In fact, we're already shipping through warehouse to all of our customers. This is a great example of executional excellence and working closely with our retail partners.","We also continue to make good progress toward building our presence and scale in emerging markets. In this quarter, we posted continued growth. One highlight was the continued integration and growth of the Parati business we acquired in Brazil late last year.","And we continue to improve the performance of our core four developed cereal markets. Canada, Australia and the UK all improved their performance in the quarter. The one exception is the U.S., who slipped backed a bit in a soft category during Q2, but we have plans to improve its performance going forward. From a financial perspective, we remain on track toward our full year guidance.","Net sales performance was sequentially better than Q1. Year-on-year, it was abated by two factors that are being considered in our full year guidance. First, U.S. consumption remained soft. This was industry-wide and affected many of our categories. And second, we felt in Q2 the residual impact of Q1's customer negotiations regarding pricing on Pringles in Europe. But we knew this would be the case, as it takes time to ramp back up to normal promotional activity.","Margin expansion continued with another quarter of improvement in our gross margin and another quarter with more than 100 basis points improvement in our operating margin. Clearly, our productivity initiatives are working and working well enough to offset the impacts of lower volume, investment in food and country mix.","The result has been earnings and cash flow that are on track to achieve our full year guidance. So Q2 was on track for both a transformation and a financial standpoint. But make no mistake, getting back to top-line growth is our top priority.","Slide 4 takes a closer look at what we are doing to return to a low single-digit net sales growth that can drive sustainable earnings and cash flow growth over time. Innovating and renovating our food and packaging to stay on or ahead of changing consumer trends is critical. In Q2, this progress is most visible in our stabilizing share of Special K and Kashi Company offerings in cereal, even as new media campaigns are just hitting the air.","It's evident in the expanding distribution of our overall product lines with Special K and Kashi snack bars launched in Q1. And we've seen in Q2 growth in Eggo, where we removed artificial colors and ingredients earlier this year.","Winning where the shopper shops is more important than ever in today's blurring channels. In U.S. Snacks, transitioning into warehouse distributional and out of DSD allows us to redeploy resources to brand-building and pack formats that can grow our brands in all channels. And across our business, we also continue to see exciting growth in emerging channels, notably e-commerce.","We've talked previously about our new marketing model. And in Q2, there's evidence that we are making progress toward making our brand-building more effective and efficient. You can see it in the brands we've invested behind: share gains in U.S. Cereal for brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes; momentum for U.S. Snacks brands like Cheez-It and Rice Krispies Treats; and steady improvement in our cereal business in the UK, Canada and Australia.","Emerging markets are going to drive packaged food growth for years to come. We've dramatically built up our scale and presence in these markets in recent years. And Q2 featured continued progress in this area. Not only did we continue to grow organically in emerging markets during Q2, but we made good progress in integrating the already-growing Parati business we recently acquired to transform our business in Brazil.","We also continue to generate double-digit growth in our unconsolidated joint ventures. These four elements will get us to top-line growth. I realize the progress is gradual, but the progress is there.","Let me now turn it over to Fareed, who will walk you through our financial results and outlook.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 shows a summary of our financial results. Our second quarter came in largely as expected. Net sales declined in the quarter, driven by the same factors we saw in Q1, but we are showing sequential improvement. Operating profit accelerated, and earnings per share growth remained strong and solidly on track for our full year guidance.","Let's get into a little bit more detail. Slide 6 breaks out our reported net sales performance into its components and also showing comparable view. As you can see from the side, our volume declines moderated from a challenging Q1. Volume was pulled down by broad softness in consumption in the U.S. and by the loss of Pringles promo activity stemming from our Q1 pricing negotiations in Europe, which lingered into Q2.","As we get into the second half, we expect Pringles to return to growth in Europe and in the U.S. We should also see a moderation of declines in Special K and Kashi, as renovated product lines take hold on the shelf and as new media campaigns are activated. And we expect our emerging markets growth to pick up.","You'll notice our price\/mix continued to firm in the quarter, adding to what has been a positive trend this year and importantly, for allowing our product-to-be benefits to flow through to profit. This price\/mix improvement was evident in all four regions. Some of it is related to pricing in currency-challenged markets, and some of it is related to price\/pack architecture work that we are doing. In the second half, most of this price\/mix improvement will be masked by the downward list price adjustments we've made as part of our U.S. Snacks transition out of DSD.","Speaking of DSD, the transition continues to proceed in line with our financial expectations, with price adjustments and volume impacts coming in as expected. So to summarize, while we're not content with the net sales decline by any means, Q2's performance was a modest improvement over Q1, and we expect to see more sequential growth to come.","Slide 7 shows how we improved our profit margin this year, both in the quarter and the first half. Gross profit margin posted another quarter of year-over-year improvement, driven by good productivity and cost savings under Project K and zero-based budgeting, and by modestly favorable net input costs. These factors more than offset the impact of continued investments in our food and packaging and the impact of lower volume.","On operating profit margin, we continued to see strong expansion in Q2, not only because of increase in gross margin, but also because of efficiencies and savings initiatives in SG&A. Importantly, this operating profit margin was broad-based, with all four of our regions once again recording increases. So our margin expansion efforts remain very much on track.","Also on track is our cash flow, as shown on slide 8. Versus the year-ago period, our net income is higher and our core working capital improved as a percentage of sales year-over-year, driven by payables. We had some timing differences on capital expenditure and other line items, like deferred and accrued taxes, pulling down cash flow in Q2. These items should smooth out over the next quarters. We feel good about hitting our full year cash flow target of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.","With that, let's turn to slide 9 and our latest guidance for the full year 2017. Q2 results give us continued confidence in our outlook for the year, so we are reaffirming our guidance. Our outlook for currency-neutral comparable sales remains at about a 3% decline versus the prior year. Within that 3% decline, we are still forecast the impact of our DSD transition to be about a 1 percentage point negative impact for the full year. Most of this impact comes in the second half and comes from a few factors that we've discussed previously. It reflects the downward price adjustments to retailers, which reflects the additional ordering, warehousing, delivery and merchandising activity they are now taking on.","There is also some impact from the elimination of tail SKUs and we have factored this estimate in for volume disruption, be it for execution or competitive reasons. Lastly, a partial offset to this volume impact will be any remaining inventory pipeline fill to our customers' warehouses, which will occur in the early part of Q3.","In the rest of the business, we should see sequential improvement in the second half versus the first half on stronger commercial plans and the absence of some unusual headwinds that we faced in the first half. Leading the way will be Pringles, which is expected to swing back to growth in Europe after its price negotiation-related decline in Q1 and Q2 and in the U.S., owing to stronger second half commercial calendar.","Another important improvement in the second half will be each of our North American Other businesses. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canada should all see further improvements in their performance as we go through the year.","On operating profit, we are reaffirming our guidance of 7% to 9% currency-neutral comparable growth. And from a phasing standpoint, we have a Q3 that's a little more investment heavy and a Q4 that's more savings heavy, both related to the timing of our exit from DSD.","On earnings per share, we reaffirm our guidance for currency-neutral comparable growth of 8% to 10%. For reported EPS, there's no change to our assumptions for upfront costs or integration costs. But the weakening of the U.S. dollar so far has meant less adverse currency translation so far, and we could see an impact that is roughly half or better of the negative $0.12 per share that we had been forecasting. So we enter the second half right on track from a financials perspective.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Paul Norman to take us through our North American results.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Fareed, and good morning everyone. As the chart on slide 10 shows, Kellogg North America saw sequential improvement in our performance for net sales, operating profit and for operating profit margin.","A few things to point out, each of which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. First, we're seeing growth or improving sales performance in businesses ranging from Specialty Channels to Frozen Foods, to the Kashi Company to Canada.","Second, an area of disappointment in the quarter was Morning Foods top-line performance. Like so many categories for cereal and toaster pastry categories, we haven't returned to last year's rates. It's incumbent on us to drive these categories, and we have stronger plans coming in the second half.","Third, we feel very good about our transition into warehouse and out of DSD, which is nearly complete. We are right on track on this big step towards the transformation of U.S. Snacks.","And finally, we continue to realize good margin expansion. It's driven by productivity and it has us on track for our 2018 targets. But I want to emphasize something. We are mindful of ensuring that these productivity efforts don't in any way inhibit our return to growth.","So, now let's briefly walk through each of our North America segments. We'll start with U.S. Snacks and our update on our DSD transition on slide 11. As I mentioned, this transition has gone very well. We are now entering the final wind-down phase. It's important to recognize what is now behind us. We've completed all customer negotiations. This means we know the list price adjustment to customers, and we have been developing joint business plans with them.","We finalized our SKU rationalizations. So we know the shelf assortment. We've started reducing complexity in our supply chain, and we started to make the store shelf work harder for us and for our customers.","As of this week, we are 100% out of DSD. That is, we are receiving orders from customers and we are shipping to all customers warehouses. It's early days, but where we have customer data, we are already seeing improved on-shelf availability.","We've now entered the final phase of the project, completing the exit. Not only are we now closing the distribution centers, but we are also in hyper-care mode, in which we devote resources to stores in order to ensure that everything, from ordering to shelf tagging, to shipments, are operating smoothly. This is important because it's also the time when we are pivoting our teams' focus to driving top-line growth. We are ramping up our brand-building and in-store activation, and we're planning and executing jointly with our customers, all to ensure we start growing demand.","We are obviously pleased with how this is going on all fronts, from the strong engagement and collaboration of our customers, to the attention to detail of our project team, to the positive attitude of our sales force and supply chain. And we really want to thank all of them for their dedication and focus on execution during this challenging transition.","Obviously, we're taking on a very complex change initiative, one that could present executional risk and\/or competitive risk at any time, but the team is managing it very well, and our full-year outlook for this transition has not changed.","Now, let's talk about Snacks results for the quarter, which is shown on slide number 12. Net sales were flat in the quarter, reflecting two factors related to the DSD transition. Firstly, there was the positive impact of inventory pipeline fill. This is the shipping of inventory into our customers' warehouses as we convert them from DSD to warehouse distribution. This began in the latter half of Q2 and ramped up in early Q3 as we converted the remaining customers.","Secondly, in-store promotion activity was reduced, as you can see in the scanner data, not only in the sharp declines in volume sold on promotion, but also in our sizable increases in average prices. As you would expect, this pullback was driven by a combination of us and our customers wanting to mitigate big shipment swings as we produce and ship inventory for their warehouses.","With us now fully in warehouse distribution, we strengthen our promotional calendar in the second half. This reduced promo activity is masking some good underlying trends. Our Big 3 cracker brands held share, despite the reduced activity. Keebler Fudge Shoppe maintained consumption and share growth in cookies, and Rice Krispies Treats sustained its momentum in wholesome snacks.","Importantly, we started up our accelerated investment in brand-building during the quarter as we transition to a pull model. This, along with some duplicative costs as we resourced up our warehouse distribution, held down profit in the quarter. But this profit came in as we'd expected, and the increased brand-building bodes well for consumption performance in the second half. So Snacks is in a good place. The DSD transition is right where we'd expected it to be, and we are now turning to a pull model that will help transform this business.","It's worth reminding everyone that this transition starts with a reduction in net sales, due to the price we set to customers, a reduction in SKUs and somewhat lower secondary and tertiary displays, so net sales come down for 12 months before they start growing again.","On the flipside, our operating profit and operating margins start to move higher right away and especially in Q4, when we completely eliminate our DSD expenses. That's even despite the sizable reinvestments we're making. All of this is already in our guidance, and I think you'll agree that we'll come out of this with a faster growing, more profitable U.S. Snacks business.","Now, let's turn to slide 13 on U.S. Morning Foods. Whilst we're pleased with our great progress on margin expansion, we are not happy about our top-line performance in this segment. Our Core 6 cereal brands collectively held share in the quarter, but the cereal category remained softer than expected. Whilst there are a variety of industry-wide trends that we can point to, it's our job to drive this category through great commercial ideas, across major brands.","To that then, we expect to see sequential improvement in the second half, and here's why. One, we will continue to support our taste-oriented brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, which continue to gain share behind effective media and innovation, respectively. In fact, Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the number one innovation this year across the entire category.","Two, Special K was down year-on-year, but it improved sequentially and even returned to share growth in June, behind innovation and our new Own It campaign. This is a promising sign going into the second half. And three, we have better in-store program in the second half. This includes stronger seasonal innovation and strong Back-to-School programs.","Looking beyond 2017, we've got to think bigger. Once we're happy with the performance of our taste brands, we know we have to do more to reassert this category's health and wellness credentials. It's the adult health-oriented segment that is pulling down the category. And the way to reinvigorate that segment has always been through nutritional innovation claims and brand-building, so that's where we're focusing our efforts.","An example of this is on the slide. Late this year, we'll be launching a new Special K Nourish offering, featuring probiotics. We'll have more to share with you as we get closer to 2018.","Now let's talk about Specialty Channels, shown on slide number 14. Our Specialty Channels business in Q2 delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth. We generated growth in our three core channels, in which we already have leading positions, foodservice, convenience stores and vending.","In foodservice, our growth was again led by the K-12 segment. And in C-stores and vending, our growth was aided by innovation. Importantly, in Q2, we implemented a transformation of our sales force to a hybrid direct and broker mode. This is expected to drive stronger focus on our core accounts, whilst expanding our market coverage by almost 40% across foodservice and convenience channels.","Operating profit margin continued to improve strongly, driven by better price\/mix and by continued savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting. So we continue to feel good about our Specialty Channels business. And growth should continue in the second half, even despite tough comparisons.","Finally, we'll turn to slide number 15 and our North America Other segment. As we said would happen, we are solidly in profit growth for this segment. Q2 was a third straight quarter of strong operating profit performance. But just as important is the fact that we also realized good sequential improvement in net sales. At the Kashi Company, sales remained pressured by last year's exiting of non-core or less profitable SKUs, promotions and categories. But we're going to be lapping those soon, and the quarter offered promising signs of what's to come. We realized another quarter of share gains in cereal and xAOC channels as well as in the natural channel. And we saw markedly improved trends in these channels through our Wholesome Snacks business, as recent innovations and media are starting to take hold. We are turning the corner on this business, and we are confident we'll continue to see sequential improvement in top-line in the second half.","In Canada, we also continue to see improving results. Recall that we have been feeling the elasticity impact from our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover FX-driven input cost inflation. We started to lap some of that, and our net sales and consumption have continued to improve. During Q2, our consumption declines in cereal moderated significantly. Our base consumption was again very strong, and we increased share as a result.","In Wholesome Snacks, we gained share, too, also behind strong base consumption. And our Pringles business grew consumption and share as well. So Canada is on the right track to meet expectations for the year.","In Frozen, Eggo grew consumption and share, aided by the removal of artificial ingredients and the launch of kid-loved shapes, with Mickey Mouse-shaped waffles leading the way.","Our frozen veggie business under MorningStar Farms and the Gardenburger brands added another quarter to its return to consumption growth, thanks to a focus on core burger offerings. So Frozen is back in growth and picking up momentum.","So to wrap up North America, Snacks came in as expected, with terrific progress on the DSD transition. Specialty Channels continues to grow. And North America Other is turning the corner. Morning Foods remains soft, so we have to redouble our efforts to get the cereal category growing again, but the net of all of this is sequential improvement on top of sustained margin expansion.","With that, I'll turn you back to John for a look at our international regions.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Europe on slide 16. Really, the story in Europe was Pringles. Every several years, dating back to before we even owned it, Pringles has undergone a brand re-stage that includes product reformulation and related price increase to catch up to inflation so that we can invest behind the brand. You'll recall that we did this in Q1 and was met with prolonged negotiations with customers. While these negotiations were resolved by April, we missed out on several Q2 promotional programs, as we had communicated on our last earnings call.","So after growing consistently at a mid to high single-digit growth rate in recent years, our Pringles business in Europe declined sharply in the first half, a very negative swing. This is a short-term disruption that we expect to turn around significantly in the second half as we resume normal commercial activities.","Less visible because of this Pringles swing has been the sequential improvement we have realized in our UK cereal business. Our consumption in Q2 was down significantly less than in recent quarters, as strong brand-building support, better share gains in all family brands, like Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Crunchy Nut.","In fact, four of the top five growing brands in this category were Kellogg brands in Q2, and we gained share overall in the month of June. So our efforts here are starting to pay off. Europe is likely to remain challenging over the foreseeable future, and we still have a lot of work to. But in the second half, we do expect to see strong sequential improvement.","Here's why. First, we are set to return Pringles to growth after the disruption in the first half, as I mentioned. Second, in cereal, we have strong commercial plans in the developed markets with a particular emphasis on Special K, which will benefit from new foods like Special K Nourish, new on-pack claims, a new test in media campaign, and a step up in brand-building investment. And third, we expect to sustain our growth in emerging markets. So we're confident we'll see better performance in Europe in the coming quarters.","Now let's talk about Latin America, which is shown on slide 17. In Latin America, our currency-neutral net sales declined year-on-year with all of the decline, and then some, related to our Caribbean\/Central America sub-region. This had to do with continued trade inventory reductions following late 2016 distributor transitions, exacerbated by what have been notably soft market conditions. We're working through these issues, and we expect to see sequential improvement in these markets in the second half.","The good news is that our large Mexico business continued to perform well, as did our legacy South America operations. Additionally, the integration of Parati, our significant acquisition in Brazil, is progressing well. That business continues to post solid growth, though it is not captured yet in our comparable basis results.","We also continue to generate price realization and zero-based budgeting savings, even if though a bit masked in Q2 by our sales declines in Caribbean\/Central America. Year-to-date, our operating profit margin is up by 60 basis points year-on-year, and we expect to see continued margin expansion in the second half. We view Latin America's first half performance as affected by temporary factors. We expect this region to grow in the second half.","We'll finish up our international discussion with Asia Pacific on slide 18. Asia Pacific had another good quarter in Q2, with growth in net sales, operating profit, and profit margin, and it featured a return to growth in Australia, continued broad-based growth in Asia, and momentum in Pringles.","Our Australian business is a good turnaround story. Over the last 18 months, we have steadily improved our performance in this developed market, primarily through innovation and renovation. And in Q2, cereal returned to positive net sales growth in Australia. In Asia, net sales grew in Korea and Japan, with India down modestly because of short-term disruption in the country's new goods and services tax. And across the region, our Pringles business posted a strong high single-digit net sales gain.","Then on top of our consolidated businesses, we have our joint ventures in West Africa and in China. Once again, both of these JVs delivered strong double-digit growth, with West Africa led by strong noodles volume and China led by e-commerce sales. Given their size and growth rates, our share of the JV's year-on-year sales growth, we'll be talking about double-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth for Asia Pacific.","So Kellogg Asia Pacific remains on track versus 2017 goals. We are growing and expanding our margins, and we're also continuing to build our presence and scale in emerging markets, some of it through organic growth, some of it through our unconsolidated joint ventures.","So allow me to summarize with slide 19. Q2 was held back by continued softness in U.S. consumption and the aftermath of price negotiations on Pringles in Europe. Our net sales performance did improve sequentially, as we said it would. And our profit margins continue to improve, reflecting the work we have done to reduce our cost structure.","We remain on our full year 2017 guidance for net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. While our sales performance remains challenged in a difficult packaged foods environment, we continue to make progress on our 2020 Growth Plan toward the transformation of our company and a return to top-line growth.","In Q2, this progress was evident in the tremendous progress we have made on our transition out of DSD. This is game-changing for us, and we've executed it extremely well. It was also evident in our growth in emerging markets, where we're not only growing organically, but also through transformative acquisitions and joint ventures. Our efforts to launch more on-trend food and packaging were evident in the improving performances by newly renovated Special K and Kashi snacks offerings. And finally, accelerated growth in e-commerce shows us seeking opportunity in a changing retail landscape. These are all important building blocks for our return to top-line growth.","As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and determination in making us a stronger Kellogg Company.","With that, we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask about some of the pricing discussions that are taking part as a part of the DSD transition. Could you talk a little bit more about the customer alignment and your discussions around list price changes and merchandising? It sounds as if the formal list price adjustments have all been agreed on and you have good visibility there, but given your commentary around lower than expected merchandising in the quarter and some of your competitors' comments on the intensity of the promotional environment, is there still a risk that the effective pricing adjustment, taking into account any additional promotional support that's needed to sustain shelf space, will be larger than expected?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Yes. Thanks, Matthew. I think we've made tremendous progress on our DSD transfer over to warehouse. And it's worth noting, as we did in the prepared comments, that, as of now, we're completely out of the DSD delivery system. We're now delivering all of our deliveries to customers through warehouse. I think Paul, Deanie and the entire team have done a tremendous job executing what I believe has been one of the most complicated transitions that any food company's attempted to do in the last several years in our industry.","I'm going to hand over to Paul to give you more detail on where we stand on that, including the various discussions with our retail partners.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Hey, Matthew, I'd just tell you it's gone and is going very well. We had great customer engagement. We have a great assortment. And we were proactive, as you probably are aware, in managing that assortment, from an SKU reduction point of view, but also with a focus on making our biggest brands and our bigger SKUs work harder within that assortment. So as SKUs come out, we gain space on our faster, harder-working SKUs.","The pricing negotiations are all behind us. For competitive reasons and obviously other reasons, I'm not going to go into those, but those will flow through our P&L as we go forward. And there's been strong collaboration between our teams internally and our customer teams internally right all the way through this. We're out of DSD. The transition is complete. We're 100% shipping through warehouses. Our focus has pivoted to really the in-store environment right now, making sure that the ordering processes are working, the shelf hands are where they need to be, helping educate store-level employees on doing the job that we used to do. And through the data we're seeing come through in the customers we can see already, we're seeing in-stock's up, which is positive.","The internal center of gravity is now very much in Deanie's team around contributing to growth. So we're executing against our pull model. Brand-building will be up significantly in the back half. Our promotional pressure comes back now in the back half following the pullback in Q2 to manage the transition. So you can expect good Back-to-School programs, fall football programs, holiday programs and the strengthening of our relation pipeline coming into 2018. Our team's done a great job and the financials are exactly where we thought they would be and on track for the year to come.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just had a question for you to follow-on on the DSD transition. I want to understand, year-to-date, the DSD trends, since you're filling the pipeline or shipping product to the retailers, DSD looks like it has actually helped your sales overall and there's still some expectation for a sales decline. So I just want to be clear on that; that that really would start to hit in Q3 and Q4 once the pipeline fill is complete. Maybe just if I could add into that, just the fact that you're now shipping all your product to customer warehouses, does that mean you're ahead of plan or this on track of what you expected?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","I'll take that and maybe Fareed might want talk about how it lays down for the year. But again, everything's on track and really where we thought it would be, so there's, I wouldn't say, we're necessarily ahead. There has been some impact obviously in the business through Q2 and we would expect to see some of that through the rest of the year. The impacts, so far year-to-date, are really two. We saw some inventory come in, in Q2. And that was probably about 5% that contributed to our performance in Q2, offset by emerging merchandising pullback and some of the price adjustments coming through.","So those two things mostly offset each other. As we pivot to the back half of the year, you will see a little more inventory come in in Q3. And also Q3 has July in it, so there's been a little bit more disruption, a merchandising pullback as we go through the execution. Then, as we said and I said in the prepared notes, we will see a drop off in net sales because of the price decline and the transfer of work as we go forward, and that would impact the P&L as we go forward. Down the P&L, we will see the costs of the DSD organization collapse as we go through that and really fluctuate with full force for Q4 this year. Does that answer your question, Chris?","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It does, yes. Thank you for that clear explanation. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A question on cereal for me, if I may. Paul, you talked about some of your frustrations a little bit. I think that's a fair word in terms of the numbers, but you're also saying that the way to turn around adult cereals is to deliver news about nutrition. I guess, what I'm curious is that realization, that understanding about what needs to be done, I don't think that's anything necessarily new. It's something that you guys have talked about for years.","So, I guess, I'm just trying to gain comfort about what will change from here. You're talking about cereal getting better, but the messaging I'm hearing about what needs to be done isn't all that different than what it's been the last few years. So maybe if I can just ask sort of why things will get better from here, that would be great.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Ken, let me take it up a level. If you look at the category, the history of that category, there have been cycles over the years that have driven the category. Those cycles are often related to health and wellness, positively and, many times, negatively. The whole fiber oat brand booms of prior years drove the category. Well frankly, through the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, low-calorie, low-fat and weight management really drove the category. And no brands rode the category harder in those years than Special K. As we get through to 2010 and into the recent years, low-calorie, low-fat has come off trend and we have obviously been impacted significantly by that.","What encourages me as I look forward and where science and nutrition is going, where the trends are, clearly what is big and right in front of us now and I think will be really important is gut health and the gut-brain connection, the importance of the microbiome and the importance of fiber coming back into people's diets, either prebiotic or probiotic benefits. Those things, considering nine out of 10 Americans don't get enough fiber today, I think are going to position our category extremely well to grow as we go forward.","So the tailwind is coming back, in my opinion, following a short period here of headwind. For us, we need to reassert our credentials in these areas. So we'll do the hygiene work we're already doing, removing artificials, et cetera, but the big wins will come from upping our claims on existing brands like Raisin Bran, Mini-Wheats, around fiber and the importance of fiber and then, driving innovation into our adult brands, things like Special K with probiotics, et cetera, as we go forward. So that's how the health and wellness piece, for me, is encouraging and gives me belief that we can get this category back with a tailwind behind it.","The other thing that's important, quite frankly, is how people eat today. And as you probably heard us talk before, 35-plus percent of cereal there is consumed outside of breakfast occasion. And in repositioning the category, it's a big word, to be more of an all-day food and an all-day snack to be consumed whenever you want, is, I think, critical to how we open up growth potential for the category, whether that's driving brands or Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes or Rice Krispies throughout the day through a recipe or consumption opportunity or whether it's bringing innovation in the area of convenience and affordability to the cereal category to unlock those opportunities throughout the day.","And then last, and also important is, we got to keep the pressure on fun and taste in this category, which has always been an important part of what drives the heartbeat of the performance of the category. If I look today, the pressure on fun and taste is fine. The other two, we can do more.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","So, Ken, if I can just add to Paul's answer, I think we do need to do more to get cereal on trend with the health and wellness trends in the marketplace and absolutely believe that we have big opportunities in the category here. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, three of the four core markets are actually doing better this year, but if I could kind of point to what's driving that in each of the three, Australia is actually renovation of foods. The Nutri-Grain food is doing much better in Australia as we have improved the nutrition profile of that food, as well as Be Natural, our Kashi-equivalent brand in Australia is also doing extremely well. UK has been driven by a program around Corn Flakes and versatility and how you eat your Corn Flakes. And Canada is being driven by a strong brand-building behind core brands. So it's never one thing. It's a factor of varieties that can drive these categories, and we're confident we can make this work, given time.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kevin Lehmann - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning; Kevin Lehmann in for David.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Hi.","Kevin Lehmann - RBC Capital Markets LLC","How you doing? Question on DSD; one of the reasons you cited for your shift from DSD to warehouse originally was to remove any potential friction with your top retail customers who would maybe rather you go through their warehouse, particularly with regard to e-commerce. So are you seeing gains with these top partners in e-commerce specifically?","And then secondly, how are you perhaps protecting your share with other customers who maybe had weaker warehouse capabilities and have actually valued your DSD presence in the past? Thanks.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Okay. So big question; the reason we originally did this was a consumer shelf-driven strategic decision, given how, when you look at the food business and the retail business, how the shopper's shopping is changing so much. So the focus was to shift our resources away from what we consider for our business, at least, to be a demoted route to market and get our resources against the shopper, the brand-building resources we need in this changing environment that the shopper shops in. Talking top-to-top with our largest customers, they all see the benefits of moving in that direction because most of our customers are moving into a click-and-collect world. Our click-and-collect for our overall e-commerce business is actually doing extremely well. It's growing in the second quarter, up 70%-plus. So we're doing very well and that's total e-comm. So we need to feed that trend as we go forward by moving more of our resources, marketing dollars, people dollars, against where that world is going to be, not just e-commerce, but also the smaller format environments that are growing as well.","We have a great warehouse system. Our customers have great warehouse systems. 75% of what we make as a company in North America already goes through a warehouse system, and we know we get better service and higher in-stocks in a warehouse system. So when we go to one delivered system to all of our retail partners, not just certain ones versus other ones, I can have a better deal-value-creation conversation about one platform delivered, shared efficiencies, scale benefits from the Kellogg Company that could help both us and them in what, let's face it, is a changing retail environment where they need to pivot some of their cost of investment against changing their model just to meet where the shopper shops.","So I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for. It wasn't really about friction. It was about a big strategic move to get ahead of the shopper is why we did it.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Kevin, if I could just add, I think all retailers win from this DSD transition. I mean, they all have the opportunity to make a stronger margin out of our brands, and you can see the level of retailer support we've had from this project, just given that to make this transition as successful as it's been, we'd have to work very closely with every single retailer across the U.S. We've had tremendous engagement and support from our retail partners. And while some retail partners were better positioned at this point in time to go through this transition than others might be, there has been overwhelming support from our retail partners as we make this move.","Kevin Lehmann - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","DSD, so one topic, a couple of little questions, John and Paul, can we just say point blank that we've crossed the most dangerous stages of the DSD warehouse transition at this point? Is that valid?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","I think we've made tremendous progress. So we've agreed to pricing. We've agreed to planograms. We've agreed the SKU reductions. In some cases obviously, we'll have less items on shelf. We know that, but we'll pick up more facings for key items on the shelf. We have gone through what's probably the most difficult, which is actually going from our people crating the orders and we physically delivering to the back of store, to our retail partners creating the orders and their labor supplying product to the shelf. All that is working incredibly well.","So I'd say that, yes, in terms of the highest risk factors, we are through that now. There's still things to be done. We're still in hyper-care in Q3 to ensure that the shelves are set properly, that the product is flowing properly, but everything we can see is working well. In fact, the first wave customers, where we can see the performance of those customers, we can see that the in-stock performance is actually better in warehouse than it was when it was in DSD. So we feel extremely good about the progress. And I would say the big risk factors are behind us. Still, things can happen to us here, but I'm feeling very, very confident about where we stand on this program.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then if I could just follow on, because I had this question about the early-stage customers. Do you have an early read on what's happened with the shelf space battle for those early customers where you have maybe a couple of months of data on this battle on the shelf because you still have a competitor out there, couple competitors, saying point blank that they're going to take shelf space from you. So just love to know if there's any early read on that shelf space battle.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Every customer's different, to be honest. And that's not trying to skirt around the question, but some of the earlier customers, we proactively culled SKUs with the aim of strengthening our assortment to get a harder-working assortment behind our biggest brands. With some customers, we're gaining space on the shelf. Some customers, we're giving up space because of items we're deleting simplify everything, quite frankly, through the process. And then, we're regaining space behind those deletions around our biggest brands like Cheez-It or Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera.","So it is a customer-by-customer picture. The aim of this, though, David, is to get a harder working portfolio. And remember, in a DSD world relative to a warehouse world, the customer margin in the warehouse world is higher than in a DSD world. So you have big mega brands with big brand-building investment, promotional pressure, there's a real incentive for the win-win here to drive these brands harder going forward.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Final question from me on DSD is your comments about second quarter \u2013 I apologize if I'm just getting this wrong, but Snacks sales were flat. I think you said there was 5 points of benefits from inventory sale to the customers but that promotions were down and that took volume down about the same amount. However, our Nielsen data says that revenue's down like 7%. So I'm just not clear on what we're expecting in the third quarter. I'm going to guess that third quarter will show a sizable negative because of the trends that we're seeing in Nielsen relative to flat second quarter sales. But is that right? And then big picture, can you reiterate the 17% margin guidance for this multi-year transition out of DSD for the Snacks segment? And that's it for me. Thanks, guys.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","July will be the same because we're still transitioning through July. So July, we don't expect any difference. Our ramping up of programming really comes in in August. That will be offset by obviously inside the P&L. So, Nielsen data, you'll see some improvement. In the P&L you'll see the impact of the net sales. As for the commitment we made in the past to put margins up to the norm, that commitment still stands.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Just on the transition pacing, obviously you've completed that now, and it was over the last few months. You've talked and I think, Paul, you just mentioned a second ago that there also was some pricing impact in the second quarter for the customers who had transitioned and who presumably were getting the trade load benefit from. What's the progression of the pricing? And how do we think about how much of that was already in the second quarter? And what's the outlook to come in terms of the just phasing of that?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Sure, it's Fareed. And maybe I'll talk first half, second half. So we did start to see the pricing adjustments flow through in Q2 as customers came on board, and that as well as lower promotions were the headwinds and then those were offset partially by the pipeline fill that we talked about. As we get into the second half, what we're going to see is a little bit of pipeline fill continue in Q3. We're going to see a greater degree of pricing adjustments flow through as more and more customers come on board.","And again, we frame the DSD top line to be 100 basis points on a full year basis across the whole company, so obviously, from a Snacks-specific standpoint, that will be more significant as we get into the quarter. But also importantly, in the second half, we're going to start to see the cost structure associated with the DSD network start to unwind. And that'll be more of a latter part of Q3 into Q4, but that's the sales infrastructure, the warehouse infrastructure as well.","So a lot's happening in the second half of the year. As you've heard, each element is pretty much landing as we projected it, so we don't have any change in terms of the guidance for what DSD is going to do to the business.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And just to follow up on that, one clarification, when you talk about accelerating the top-line growth, even with the increasing headwinds from the price cuts in the DSD transition, is that still true? Total company still expects the total sales momentum to improve over the course of the rest of the year?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Yes. So we expect the back half underlying business to improve in the back half of the year. What's driving that is even though we'll have some more headwind from the price adjustment within U.S. Snacks, we expect a meaningfully stronger performance from our European business as our Pringles business in Europe comes back from promotional activity. We expect to see continued progress in businesses in North America such as Frozen and Kashi. And we expect to see our Latin American business return to growth in the back half of the year as well. So a number of factors outside of the DSD discussion; we're expecting to see a much stronger back half that will help offset a greater impact from the price reduction going through the DSD business in the back half of the year.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Just one question, something just caught me in your presentation. There's a part related to DSD, but I wanted to ask you relative to cereal. Changing this distribution's required you to cull some tail brands. What seems to me from looking at the data, which I do a lot of these days, your Morning Foods, your cereal portfolio really has a number of big identifiable brands that maybe are not recent innovations, maybe not as proliferated. And the real underperformers in the Morning Foods category have been maybe some of the more newer brand equities or more niche-targeted brand equities, where maybe you've extended them. I guess, I'm trying to understand this, if there's not maybe a thesis here where you get back to a base, where maybe the cereal category like overextended itself for a few years. And you get back to a base of core users who probably never really changed, just the ancillary users who you attracted with new ingredients or you're trying to fight with Greek yogurt or whatever over the period of 2010, 2015 sort of fall away, but that core base does better because that seems to be somewhat happening in the data. It's not completely so, but I just kind of wanted your thought about that because certainly, we're all kind of looking for that turn. Thanks very much.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Hey, Jonathan. Internally, we talk, focused very much on what we call the Core 6. There are six brands, which are our Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Rice Krispies, Special K, Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran, plus one or two, which is Kashi, on account of the Kashi Company. Those brands cover the broad spectrum of needs in the cereal category.","And so for the fundamentals of the category to work well, you have to have, we say, you've got to be firing on all cylinders across those six brands. That is innovation. That is renovation. That is great ideas. And that is excellence when it comes to in-store execution and leveraging the scale of those brands across our retail base. And so that's very much what we focus on.","So what you said is where we're going or what we're doing. As I mentioned, there are areas we can do better. We need to focus more on those health and wellness credentials across our adult brands. We also need to adapt more to the changing shopper environment as we go forward and make sure that our foods, our brands are available in those areas where the shoppers are shopping down the road. So what you said is what we're doing.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I get what you're doing, but I guess what evidence can you provide or indicate like demographically or certain user, any custom work or any like facts or data you can share with us that show that that's what you need to do, that's why you're doing this and maybe that it's working or spots where it has worked?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","We segment this category through something we call demand chain. It looks at consumer and it looks at shopper. And it looks at cohorts within all different age groups. So we target, whether it's millennials, boomers, families, we constantly look at how the shopper shops as part of how we motivate and drive these brands. We can do more against boomers. And we can do more against millennials and Hispanics in our portfolio. We over-index against Hispanics and do very well there. Millennials, we need to drive relevancy. This is why versatility comes into play and this is why those health and wellness credentials are really important in today's environment, but also important in the environments in which they shop and how they shop.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","John P.

Welcome to the Kellogg's Company Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations for Kellogg Company. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference call.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter 2014 results. I'm joined by John Bryant, Chairman and CEO; Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer; and Alistair Hirst, Senior VP of Supply Chain.","The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront cost, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of the presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, November 3. And the call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. And now I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today we announced third quarter earnings per share that were ahead of our expectations. In addition, our results for operating profit were greater than we had anticipated and sales was slightly below.","As we mentioned at the back-to-school conference last month, we continue to face headwinds in developed markets and categories, although we saw a good sales growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific in the quarter. Also, as we highlighted at the conference, we have some exciting ideas for innovation and brand building in 2015.","As a result of our third quarter performance being mostly as we had expected, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. Ron will provide more color regarding this later, but we continue to expect that for the full year, internal net sales will be down between 1% and 2%; underlying internal operating profit will be down between 1% and 3%; and currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will be between up 1% and down 1%. Also, as you can see highlighted on the slide, we continue to make progress on Project K, our 4-year efficiency and effectiveness program.","In the third quarter, we opened our North American service center, as part of the global business services initiative. We also announced the closure of our snack plant in Columbus, Georgia and the reduction of production at our Manchester, U.K. plant. We are very pleased with the progress we have made so far, and Alistair will give more detail regarding the supply chain organization and Project K in a few minutes.","Now let's turn to Slide 4 in a brief discussion to some of the things we're working on for 2015. We've spoken to you over the last year about some of the challenges that we faced in developed categories and regions, particularly with our weight management brands. We've also told you how we've begun to tailor our R&D efforts and support to better address consumer trends. Specifically, we've been working hard on Special K globally and on Kashi in the U.S.","In the U.S., this includes innovation like Kashi GOLEAN Crunch!, which is non-GMO verified, Bear Naked Granola, Kashi Organic Promise sprouted grains and Raisin Chia Granola. And it also includes Special K gluten-free and Special K protein. In fact, in the U.S., we are completely redesigning Special K and are relaunching it is a healthy lifestyle brand across our categories. We're also relaunching the brand in other regions around the world. I'll talk more about this later.","And we've got a lot more planned too, just some of which you can see on the slide. You'll also see some of the broader brand-building initiatives that we have planned for early in 2015 detailed on the chart. In the U.S. these plans include the Give A Child A Breakfast Program and the Kellogg's Open For Breakfast Program.","Slide 5 shows specific detail regarding our Breakfast for Better Days program. We believe that eating breakfast leads to better days and better lives. As a result, we have focused our global philanthropic efforts on providing breakfast to those who need it most. As part of the program, we will donate 1 billion servings of cereal and snacks by the end of 2016 to children and families in need worldwide.","To increase the impact of this program, we also engage in campaigns that provide support for breakfast programs when consumers purchase Kellogg's cereal. In 2015, we will run this program in 15 countries.","Our company is built on a history of caring about these issues. And we know that consumers, particularly millennials, share these values.","And now I'll turn it over to Ron, for a discussion of our financial performance.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 6 shows the financial results for the third quarter. Internal sales declined by 1.7%, approximately equal to last quarter's performance and slightly below our expectations.","As John mentioned, we saw good growth in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific, as sales in our U.S. Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks businesses were below expectations. Underlying internal operating profit decreased by 1.8%. This was better than our expectations. We managed our overhead investment lower and reduced incentive compensation to align the performance. While we increased brand building in our developed cereal businesses, overall brand building was slightly lower year-over-year but comparable as a percent to sales.","Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments and Project K costs, were $0.94 per share in the quarter. This result included a negative $0.01 per share impact from a higher tax rate. Currency translation had no impact on earnings year-over-year.","","Reported earnings per share for the quarter were $0.62, including $0.02 of Pringles integration costs, $0.19 of upfront cost related to Project K and an $0.11 impact from mark-to-market adjustments.","Slide 7 shows the composition of the third quarter sales growth. Total internal sales declined by 1.7% and total price and mix improved by 0.2%. Both Latin America and Asia-Pacific posted gains.","Volume decreased by 1.9% in the quarter. This decline was the result of the performance of our developed cereal businesses around the world and the performance of the U.S. Snacks business. We do continue to see good volume growth in our international snack businesses and in our cereal business in Asia.","Finally, currency translation impacted reported sales growth by a negative 0.4% in the quarter, primarily as a result of the euro and the Canadian dollar.","Slide 8 shows our underlying recorded gross profit and gross margin for the quarter. Our underlying gross margin decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter and was impacted by a fixed cost absorption due to the lower volume in our network. We also saw a bit more inflation in cost of goods sold related to distribution costs.","Our savings from productivity were in line with expectations. We're essentially covered on commodities and packaging for the remainder of the year and we have taken some coverage on commodities and packaging for next year. We'll give you guidance for 2015 on the fourth quarter conference call, but material related inflation for next year currently looks to be relatively benign.","Slide 9 shows the quarterly internal operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's internal operating profit decreased by 9%. This is driven by our lower sales performance particularly in the cereals and snacks businesses. In addition capacity issues as a co-factor had an impact on the sales and profitability of our specialty business.","Investment in brand building as a percent of sales was unchanged in North America in the third quarter, although we did increase our investment in cereal at a high single-digit basis.","We expect improvements in operating profit performance in the fourth quarter in North America, although we continue to expect that operating profit will be down for the year.","Internal operating profit in Europe increased by 4% in the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by lower input inflation as well as productivity savings and cost of goods sold.","Internal operating profit grew by 20% in Latin America. Top line growth of more than 7% drove the result. In addition, the growth in operating profit included a double-digit increase in brand building in the period. And we saw an increase in internal operating cost of 5% in the Asia-Pacific region in the quarter. This is driven by solid top line growth and strong productivity in cost of goods sold. And the results also included an increase in investment and brand building.","Slide 10 shows year-to-date cash flow through the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.18 billion on track with our expectations for the year, and we still expect cash flow from operations, after capital spending, to be at the low end of our range between $1 billion and $1.1 billion.","Cash flow through the third quarter was below last year's level, primarily due to the cash required for Project K. We continue to make good progress on our accounts payable initiative and expect it to improve annual cash flow by around $200 million this year.","Capital spending was $355 million so far this year. And our expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be between 4% and 5% of sales, including investment for Pringles, Project K and a new plant in India.","And finally, share repurchases through the third quarter were $690 million. And it's worth noting that we have returned approximately $1 billion to shareowners so far this year. We continue to expect that we'll reduce our average share count by approximately 1.5% over the full year.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 in our guidance for 2014. As always, this guidance excludes items that affect comparability and please see our notes for details. It's important to know that our currency-neutral guidance remains consistent with our prior outlook. Currency was previously expected to provide a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share, and we now expect it to be neutral for the year. As John mentioned, we continue to expect that internal net sales will be down between 1% and 2% for the full year.","Total cost of goods inflation is expected to be near the high end of our 3% to 4% range, but we still expect that productivity and savings from Project K will more than offset the inflation. This should lead to moderate net deflation for the year. And we now expect that underlying reported gross margins will be flat to down slightly for the full year, including higher distribution costs and lower volume through our manufacturing plants.","We continue to expect that underlying internal operating profit will be in a range between down 1% and down 3%. And we continue to expect that currency-neutral comparable earnings will be in a range between down 1% and up 1% or $3.81 to $3.89 per share.","We still expect that the 53rd week will add approximately $0.07 per share. And as I mentioned earlier, currency will now have no year-over-year impact.","This should result in an earnings per share, including the 53rd week, of $3.88 to $3.96. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 29% and interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $210 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to anticipate that cash flow will be at the low end of the range between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. And we still expect capital spending to be between 4% and 5% of sales.","The only change to the earnings per share walk on Slide 12 is the outlook for the impact of currencies. Note that this outlook still excludes any potential impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Our estimates for integration cost have not changed and are still between $0.07 and $0.09 per share. Project K costs are expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65 per share.","And now, I'll turn it over to Alistair for some comments on supply chain and Project K, before John discusses the operating segments.","Alistair D. Hirst","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Slide 14 details the vision we have for the supply chain organization and it's one that I showed you last year. We have a great supply chain team here at Kellogg and we are committed to delivering high-quality food while developing a supply-chain that creates the best value for the lowest cost. And we've made some significant changes to the organization over the last 3 years. I'll talk more about that in a minute, but some of the improvements we've made and the processes we've implemented, combined with the Project K initiative, have allowed us to continue to reach our goals and provide flexibility to the broader organization. In fact, we continuously strive to be a strong stable foundation from which the company can grow.","Now let's turn to Slide 15 and a few details regarding the initiatives underway in the organization. First, we are aligning the network to better reflect the current state of the business and to anticipate future demands. A lot of work has been done. A lot of work is underway to build the supply chain of the future. We have also done a lot of work to better organize the structure of the supply chain. This has involved changes designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of both our processes and production. And finally, we have made a significant amount of progress implementing our global business services initiative. So let's take look at each in a little more detail.","First, let's look at Slide 16 and some more detail regarding the alignment of the supply chain network. We are a year into Project K and we have announced a number of changes to the network. And we are on plan in all 4 regions. We are targeting having the right number of plants and the right amount of capacity within those plants in each of the businesses. As I said, we must create the supply chain of the future, one that anticipates the needs of the business in the years to come.","In North America, we've announced consolidation in both our cereal and snack networks and we are executing the real occasional[ph] production according to plan.","In Europe, we've announced the reduction of capacity at cereal plants in the U.K. and we've also successfully begun producing Pringles in Poland at our new snack facility in Kutno. We are particularly proud of our teams in Europe and Kutno for bringing this plant online in the vertical startup between the production of the first chip on June 13 and the completion of the first shippable case on June 28. And this plant has already produced well over 15 million cans of Pringles and is at 80% utilization.","In Latin America, we've successfully completed a restructuring of the supply chain and have successfully executed a decoupling strategy between the Mexican and Guatemalan businesses. This means that we now ship both product to Guatemala, where it's packed to demand.","In Asia-Pacific we've announced the construction of a Pringles plant in Malaysia and increasing capacity at a snacks plant in Thailand and construction of a cereal plant in India, each of which will supply product to the Asia-Pacific region. And again, all of this has been done to plan and on budget. As you can tell, with a lot of work underway, we're continuing to review the network for a few good opportunities.","Slide 17 shows a few specifics regarding changes to the structure of the supply chain organization. We have standardized processes and streamlined the organization. First, we have invested a significant amount of resource in the development of both people and processes in what we call design to value. This is just what you'd imagine. It's coordination across insights, marketing, research and development and supply chain to take an idea and get the design of the food and packaging right and to give the consumer what they're willing to pay for. And as importantly, it's also about getting the economics of the design right at the same time.","The second part of the process is what we call produce to design. Producing exactly what was envisioned in the development process is very important for the success of the food and also for the economics of the introduction. And it has a meaningful impact on the quality of the food we produce.","So we've also invested a significant amount of time on improving this process. And we've done this while also reducing corporate supply chain overhead.","Now let's turn to Slide 18 and the final piece of Project K and some of the additional changes we've made to the supply chain. We have made great progress in the implementation of the global business services initiative or GBS. This initiative will focus on 4 functions, with the first being the finance function. We have announced 2 regional hubs, 1 is in Michigan for North America and the other is in Bucharest for Europe. Our GBS is a three-tiered model, a smaller amount of the company's functional work will continue to be done in the business units and the remainder will be done at the global service center. The North America Center opened in the third quarter of this year and the European center will open next year. In addition, other parts of GBS are having a positive impact, too, although it's early in the process.","In source-to-pay, we are focused on global analysis in the procurement function, which has made the process more efficient and effective. We've also been driving the efficiency of our demand planning activities, which is simply a means of improving our forecast accuracy, which will lead to lower inventory, less waste, lower logistics cost, better fill rate and increased efficiency. And it will also support our plans to drive sustainability, as I'll discuss in a minute.","As our transportation group is working on increasing the efficiency of our network and we're seeing meaningful savings, which are helping us to mitigate the cost inflation that Ron just previously mentioned.","And now as you'll to turn to Slide 19, you'll see the time line detailing areas of focus for the organization. In 2012, we focused on the fundamentals and saw a lot of success. In 2014, we are continuing to focus on the right to win. This includes the implementation of Kellogg Work Systems or KWS. KWS is a proven model that promotes employee engagement and drives increased efficiency, including lower rates of waste. And KWS, along with other initiatives, has helped us build a stable manufacturing network. This in turn has provided a base for increased productivity in the supply chain organization and in other areas of the business. I'll talk about some of the successes we've had in a minute.","And finally, is the right to lead. Some of the activities that I have already mentioned will contribute to the creation of truly end-to-end supply chain solutions over the next couple of years. This important next step will be our focus in both 2015 and 2016.","As I told you last year, we want to be dependable but agile, and we must drive profitable sales growth. And most importantly, we must do all of this while maintaining the safety of our food and our people.","As I mentioned earlier, Slide 20 shows detail regarding some of the successes we've had as we've executed the right to win initiatives. We've seen good performance on safety rates over recent years, as the total recordable incident rate has remained low. Our history of driving cost savings through productivity has been very good with us meeting or exceeding our target of 3% to 4% annual savings in recent years.","And on food safety, we've seen a measurable improvement. Obviously, each of these areas remains very important to us. They represent a continuous process. And we believe that the great work we've done over the past few years can continue and that our performance can actually improve even more.","And finally, before we reach the summary, let's turn to Slide 21 on our commitments to sustainability. As you know, we view improvement in this area as a continuous journey and it is one to which we are strongly committed. We understand that our consumers are concerned about the environment, where their food comes from and how it is grown, as are we. Sustainability of being part of the company for more than 100 years, and we recently announced commitments for global sustainability that we plan to achieve by 2020. We are focusing our support in the livelihoods of the farmers, growers and suppliers that rely on us and on whom we depend.","And in addition, we are building up on the environmental commitments we announced in 2008, as we work to further conserve natural resources, where we source and produce our foods. Of course, these are the right things to do for our suppliers, our employees, our customers and our consumers, but they're also the right thing to do for the health of the business and that help cost savings and increased productivity.","So let's turn now to Slide 22 and my summary. The supply chain organization has come a long way in recent years. We have increased our performance when measured by a number of metrics. And most importantly, we've built a solid and dependable base, which can enable future growth and profitability. We have started to realign the network to provide a footprint that will serve the future Kellogg. We've invested in improving the whole supply chain from design to production. We've seen significant improvement already and expect more as we develop these initiatives over the next couple of years.","And we're driving increased effectiveness and efficiency through the implementation of GBS. Project K, the evolution of the supply chain, the savings we get and the reinvestment are all a process. We're on a 4-year journey. It is going well so far. And we are optimistic regarding our ability to drive it further in the years to come. And we remain confident in our flexibility where developing will drive future profitable growth.","And now I'd like to end by thanking all of the employees of the supply chain organization globally for all their hard work. The process isn't an easy one, but they are executing with excellence.","And now I'll turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Alistair. Now let's turn to Slide 23 and some specifics regarding the Morning Foods business. As you can see, internal net sales declined by 4.7% in the quarter. We started our category building programs in the second quarter in the U.S. and the third quarter in the U.K. and Australia. In the U.S., it's fair to say that while we saw some improvement in our consumption trends in general, and in Q2 in particular, we saw less improvement than we have hoped. We are continuing our media investment in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we have more initiatives planned for early 2015 and more to come later in the year.","Remember that this is an ongoing initiative. we've got some exciting ideas planned. We remain confident that the category will return to growth over time.","Specifically in the third quarter, Special K and Kashi accounted for all of our declining category share. So on Special K, we are changing the positioning of the brand by focus on dieting to weight loss. This focus will stress the role that Special K can play in the healthy lifestyle.","We are reinventing all aspects of the Special K brand in 2015. This will include innovation, packaging, advertising and consumer promotion. And each of these changes will highlight Special K's position as part of our weight loss program. We have new packaging and advertising that highlight the simplicity and goodness of the food. We have consumer promotions that will help people meet their goals, and we have innovation, including Special K protein and Special K food and treats that will directly appeal to consumer trends. And we'll also extend innovations beyond the traditional cereal category, with more hot cereals planned.","Also, we launched the Special K goes beyond cereal and captures all the elements of the brand in the U.S., including Special K cracker chips and Special K bars.","We also have plans for Kashi. This is a great brand in a category that's on trend and we need to lead more with both the Kashi and the Bear Naked brands. We are completing the renovation of the GOLEAN brand, to make it certified GMO free. We're converting the heart-to-heart brand to USDA organic, and we're targeting more progressive nutrition with innovation, such as sprouted grains, chia granola and others.","On Bear Naked, we're experimenting with new blends of granola and we've also got some new Bear Naked bars. As you know, David Denholm and his team are just getting started on the transition of Kashi and Bare Naked and we know that making structural improvements is not a quick fix. However, we are making the right decisions and we think that these great brands will return to growth over time.","And finally for Morning Foods. Consumption in our Pop-Tarts business declined in the quarter due to difficult comparisons, resulting from the introduction of Peanut Butter Pop-Tarts last year and the timing of introductions this year. We've got a new PB&J variety of planned introduction in November and believe that this business will return to growth.","So we're making progress with our plans for the cereal business, and to driving category growth over the longer term. We're addressing the issues we face and the team is doing a lot of work on both innovation and brand building. As I mentioned earlier, we realized that there is no quick fix in this business, but we're confident that we'll start to see improvement, as we progress through next year.","Now let's turn to Slide 24, and take a closer look at our cereal plans for 2015. The slide is similar to one that Paul Norman shared with you at the back-to-school conference, and highlights the actions we will take to drive improvement in the cereal category in developed markets.","First of all, consumer trends are continually evolving and we have to better appeal to changing views on helpful moments. This means meeting the changing needs of consumers and more quickly addressing the trends that we saw. For example, you can see on the chart Kashi Organic sprouted grains and Kashi Raisin and chia granola. These new products, along with high-protein Special K and gluten-free Special K are our first step in the right direction.","Next, we must continue to offer better convenience through the use of new packaging ideas, the development of new foods and entry into adjacencies like breakfast drinks. Next, as I mentioned earlier, we must engage on the consumers on the issues that they care most about as we're doing with our Breakfast for Better Days programs and our Open for Breakfast platform.","And finally, we have to drive better impact through the path to purchase. This means having excellent sales fundamentals and great in-store execution. It also means adding fun back into the bars and driving bigger events and more in-store bid-up. These are our 4 main areas of focus as we head into next year.","Let's turn to Slide 25 and our U.S. Snacks business. Internal net sales declined by 4.2% in the third quarter. It's important to note that this performance was driven by weakness in weight management products, as it was in the cereal business. In fact, Special K bars, Special K cracker chips and Right Bites' 100-calorie cookie packs accounted for essentially all of the quarterly sales decline posted in this segment.","Again, 0.3 of a point of share in the cracker category in the quarter. The Cheez-It brand posted consumption growth of 2.9%, Town House posted growth of 4.9% and account posted growth of 6.5%, all significantly better than the category's performance.","Cheez-It groups has gained more than a point of share since it was launched earlier this year and the original versions of both Town House and Club brands continue to post good results due to brand building support and good sales execution.","We lost share in the cookie category in the quarter. Of those I mentioned, Chip Deluxe and Fudge Shoppe posted good growth in consumption headed by Chips Delights products co-branded with M&Ms and by Fudge Shoppe pantry packs. Our cookie business was, again, most affected by the consumption of Right Buys' 100-calorie packs, consumption declined at an accelerated rate and accounted for more than half of Kellogg's share loss in the quarter.","We again saw the effect of reductions in the number of SKUs in the tail that we told you about last quarter, and we expect this impact will continue for the balance of this year and into early next year.","Consumption in the wholesome snack category declined by almost 2% in the period and Kellogg lost share. Within that though, Nutri-Grain posted a slight gain in category share and Rice Krispies Treats posted a double-digit increase in consumption and gained 0.8 of a point of share. The strong performance of our Rice Krispies was aided by good cohort and of the launch of new Rice Krispies treat blast.","Kellogg's overall share loss was driven by declines in the consumption of both Special K bars and FiberPlus bars. The issues with these brands are similar to ones we've seen in the cereal category.","To address these issues, we have new products and activities planned for introduction in the fourth quarter and in 2015. For example, we are launching differentiated Special K bars and new Special K Cracker Chips and are completely relaunching the brand in early 2015.","The Pringles business posted net sales growth of approximately 7% in the quarter with good results in non-measured channels. Growth was driven by the Pringles core care, grab and go and the new Tortilla Pringles.","The productivity planned for both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year and optimistically going to future growth for this great brand in the U.S. and around the world.","Obviously, we aren't unhappy with the performance of our snack business. Pringles, the cracker business and the core cookie business are performing well, although we've continued to see underperformance in some areas, and in the wholesome snack business, specifically. We are increasing investment in our snack business and are developing plans to drive improvement, as we get into 2015.","Now let's turn to Slide 26 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Internal net sales decreased by 4.1% in the quarter. This was driven by capacity issues and then copackers, and then inventory dealer is a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery. It is important to note that these issues are now behind us, although they had a significant impact on results for the quarter. Excluding them, we saw net sales growth driven in part by good results in innovation.","Elsewhere in the business, we saw a strong response to innovation in the K-12 school business in Foodservice as we've introduced wholegrain Rice Crispy Treats, new toaster pastries, new Cheez-It crackers and Eggo Pop Chips for the back-to-school period. We've done well in cereal and snacks and have gained share in the waffle, pancake and toasted pastry segment.","In the convenience business, we achieved share growth in hot cereal, salty snack and cracker segments. Kellogg posted double-digit consumption growth in the salty snack category, as a rate more than twice that at the category[indiscernible].","And we again saw a decline in sales in custard segment as we exited some less profitable businesses. Overall results in the Specialty Channels business was disappointing in the third quarter, and with the result of the issues I mentioned. Our expectations our better results in the fourth quarter.","Slide 27 shows the performance of the North America Other segment, which include the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses. Overall, this segment posted an internal sales decline of 1.1% in the quarter. The Frozen Foods business posted a slight decline in internal net sales in the quarter, although volumes increased in a low single-digit rate. The net sales performance was a result of mix and costs associated with launch of new products.","New Eggo Bites continue to do well in the quarter and we just began the launch of new Eggo handheld sandwiches in September. Obviously, it's still very early, but initial indications are that it's being well received. And we're also excited to be relaunching the Leggo My Eggo brand building program in the fourth quarter as well.","Net sales also declined slightly in the Canadian business in the quarter, although we saw good results in the frozen food business and the snack business.","In addition, the consumption of Pringles increased at double-digit rate in the latest quarterly data as the launch of Tortilla Pringles has also gone very well in Canada.","In 2014 in Canada, where we executed our cereal and milk program, well[ph], we saw a good response. And we have a heightened focus on processing with both Special K cereal and handheld sandwiches planned for 2015. In addition, we've got new activity planned for All-Bran, Froot Loops and [indiscernible], and we've got other innovations scheduled for launch between Kashi cereal and snacks.","Let's turn to Slide 28 in our European business. Net sales in the region declined by 0.6% in the third quarter. The snacks business performed well, largely due to good results from Pringles, which was offset by declines in the cereal business.","The performance posted by individual countries was largely as expected, except for a shortfall in Germany, driven by changes to the commercial schedule.","The most significant challenge in the region remains the performance of the Special K brand. As we mentioned earlier, we have initiatives intended to address this performance planned for 2015, including new communication, an upgrade to the food, improvement in packaging and better promotional activities.","In the U.K., our cereal programs are showing early signs of success. The parent brand, origins program, and the back-to-school themes program, both achieved good retail support and execution. In addition, we are making progress in the rollout of breakfast stations, which includes cereal cups. Offsetting this growth was the continuing deflationary environment in the U.K. As a result, we are focused on improving both mix and the effectiveness of promotions.","And finally, for the European business. The Pringles business posted mid-single digit net sales growth in the third quarter. This continued strong performance was driven by our focus on improving availability, visibility and awareness. Investment and brand building for Pringles increased in a double-digit rate. We saw good results from the summer speaker camp promotion, with outstanding execution of retail. Growth was broad-based across all markets.","Slide 29 shows the performance of our Latin American business. We posted 7.3% net sales growth in the quarter. This was a result of growth in Venezuela, Mexico and [indiscernible] business.","The cereal business in Latin America posted good results in the third quarter, where we saw some competitive price promotions in Mexico, which was better than chocolate and all family segments later in the period. We saw some share gains in Q2 in the Colombian and Venezuelan business. And in Mexico, we're implementing parent brand programs, supporting the relaunch of Choco Krispies and All-Bran and beginning a nutrition related initiative.","The underlying momentum of the Pringles business continues, driven by strong commercial programs, innovation and great execution. And the wholesome snack business is driving share growth, despite the slowdown in category in Mexico and Puerto Rico.","We expect to continue good sales growth in Latin America in the fourth quarter and we will again increase investment in brand building in the double-digit range. We have granola and Muesli launching in parts of the region in the fourth quarter. We have parent brand programs continuing as well, and we have a lot more activity scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2015.","Now let's turn to Slide 30 and our Asia-Pacific business. Asia-Pacific posted strong results in the third quarter. Net sales increased by 5%, both the Asian and Pringles businesses posted double-digit net sales growth in the quarter.","Net sales in Australia declined in the quarter, although this represented a sequential improvement from the results posted in the first half of the year. Performance in the third quarter benefited from the timing of promotion, innovation and the Breakfast for Better Days current brand activity.","Consumption in the cereal category in Australia, however, continued to be under pressure during the period. The sales decline in Australia was more than offset by the double-digit growth in the Asian and Pringles businesses.","Net sales in India increased in the double-digit rate and the business appears to have rebounded from a macro economic-driven weakness we saw earlier in the year. In addition, the Japanese business also posted double-digit net sales growth, driven by a continued strong performance of granola. So we had a good quarter in the Asia Pacific region and we're optimistic we're growing the potential for this business, as we enter 2015.","So finally, let's turn to Slide 31 and the summary. The third quarter's earnings per share and operating profit were ahead of our expectation and we're maintaining our guidance for the year. And we're also making the right calls in a difficult environment. We are seeing strong growth from our acquisitions of Pringles. We continue to execute Project K well. It will provide us with the tool we need for growth over the next few years. We have invested in the U.S. sales organization in both warehouse and networks. And we continue to invest in creating food that is on trend. And we will continue to invest in our great brands over time.","We know that these are the right actions, although we also know that sustainable improvement will take time. These Kellogg employees are making a difference every day. They are driving the efficiencies, generating the ideas and executing the plans necessary for improvement in the years to come. So as always, I'd like to end by thanking them for all their hard work.","And with that, I'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from David Hayes with Nomura.","David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I should just keep to one question, as requested. So just on A&P spend. Obviously, you talked A&P at group level being slightly down year-on-year in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could be a little bit more specific about the extent of what is slightly down. And then, tying that into the Morning Foods category, I wonder if you can be more specific about the A&P profile in the quarter in that category. And I guess the reason I'm driving into that is because with the change of management with Paul coming across and then the Kashi management changes as well. I wonder whether there was a delay to some extent in the brand communication support and that you catch that up in the fourth quarter, which then leads to the question, does the fourth quarter see an uplift year-on-year on the A&P spend.","Ronald L. Dissinger","David, it's Ron. Yes, in terms of our A&P spend year-over-year, our brand building essentially was down in line with the decline in sales. So what I said in the prepared remarks was that as a percent to sales, our brand building was comparable year-over-year. So a little less than 2 points of decline. Now specifically in Morning Foods, we increased our A&P at a high single-digit rate. So we've invested behind the category building programs that we intended to invest behind in the quarter.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are there any indications from your perspective that the heavy promotional environment we've seen across food is abating at all? I was at a Kroger store tour yesterday. I can't recall ever seeing so many yellow sale signs up at the same time. So I'm guessing not, but I'm just hoping to pick your brain a little bit on whether there's any light at the end of the tunnel here.","John A. Bryant","Ken, as I look at the categories that we operate in, we operate in categories that are always intensely competitive. I don't think we're seeing a big increase in the promotional activity within the categories in which we operate. However, I think there are a number of other categories in the food area that have been seeking more merchandising support. And that is providing more -- a broader competition for the same amount of real estate in store. And so, as a result, I think we are seeing a little less performance than we'd like to see from our merchandising activity in-store.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And as you talk to -- just a follow-up. As you talk to your customers about that -- and again, maybe it's not in your categories so it's harder to see. But is there any indication that it gets better from here or just more of the same as we go, given the struggles across center store?","John A. Bryant","I can't think everyone is growth of the U.S. and expect the pressure to continue to be there on merchandising. Our solution to that is to invest back into our sales organization and take more of our future into our own hands. We're doing that by investing back in our DSP organization this year, adding additional reps. And reintroducing the warehouse reps on the cereal side, which will probably have more impact in the '15 than in '14. But ultimately, we realize that we have the responsibility to create that entertainment in store, as well as working with our retail partners.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, you've used the words this morning, no quick fix on the cereal side several times, and that's certainly consistent with your previous comments as well. And you're certainly not ready to go into detail on 2015 yet. But I guess on the spirit of your comments, it would seem like our expectation ought to be that the ramped up savings that start to come from Project K next year are likely needed for reinvestment rather than, let's say, a whole bunch of it dropping to the bottom line next year. Particularly given all the new items you have coming in '15, would you say that's more directionally a fair comment at this stage?","John A. Bryant","Andrew, just say, I'd rather not give 2015 guidance until we get to the fourth quarter conference call. If I sit back and look at our company, the key thing that we need to do is to return the company to top line growth. Our sales are down 1% to 2% this year on internal basis. Quite frankly, in the current environment, we only need sales growth of plus 1% to 2% to make our economic algorithm work. And so we are focused on doing that and Project K is a big enabler to enable us to invest back in the business, whether it be back into our sales organization in the U.S., back into improving our foods, so it's even more on trend. We're changing consumer views of health and wellness, and investing back in brand building, although recognizing that we have $1.5 billion of brand building already so we have quite a bit of fuel in the engine. So I appreciate the question, but I'll defer until the fourth quarter call to give more specific guidance on 2015.","Operator","And the next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my major concern about the cereal category and I guess other carb snacks in the portfolio is consistent with what you've said, John, is that consumers attitudes towards carbs and the mix of carbs in their diet is changing against you. And it just seems like every dietitian, nutritionist and athlete is talking about reducing carbs. So I guess, I'm asking, is it unrealistic to assume that the cereal category and you have the resources to change those attitudes or at least educate people on balance between carbs and protein? There's nothing evil about carbs. But with all of these experts saying one thing, what can the cereal category do to kind of -- to change that?","John A. Bryant","Robert, I think if you step back and look at the food industry, there's a lot of fads and trends that go through the food industry at any point in time. Clearly, some of those items out there right now are not helpful to the cereal category, whether it be carbs or gluten-free or some of the other ones that are out there. What we need to do is to continue to provide foods that are more on trend with some of those beliefs, and also to communicate to people some of the great benefits that our foods have. Our foods are very simple, a corn flake is essentially corn being rolled and toasted and Rice Krispies just rice that's been puffed. Talk about the simplicity of the foods, talk about the healthy elements of the food, whether it be fiber or whole grain, et cetera. So I think we have an opportunity to talk about the benefits of the food more. Also the foods that have been more on why would some of those changing trends and continue to work to help consumers understand the benefits of the food. So I don't believe it's beyond our ability to improve on the current environment. I would say that I'd be cautious on the speed of that improvement, as we look out into 2015.","Operator","And the next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I got a question about just gross margins and gross profits. And I guess really 2 parts to it. One is, could you give us some sort of context around how much volume deleveraging right now is weighing down on gross profits and gross margins. Trying to just get a sense of what -- how that's affecting the base and as you improve volume growth, what type of leverage that are maybe on that. And then the second part is just looking out over the next few years as you get through the supply chain improvements that you're making. Is there a sense that gross margins can get back into kind of the low 40s levels, where they had been historically? Or is there something else that might impede that ability to get gross margins back up to closer to historical levels?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, Brian, it's Ron. So in terms of our gross margin expectations, we've said when we launched Project K that the initiatives we would undertake in association with Project K could improve our gross margins by about 150 basis points over that 4-year period. And we still believe that obviously, there are a number of other things that could impact us over that 4-year period, including significant commodity deinflation, not suggesting that that's going to occur, but obviously, that's a factor. So we do have a goal, as you look at our sustainable growth model as well as to improve our gross margins over time so that we can invest back in brand building and innovation. In terms of the fixed cost absorption impact from deleveraging a bit on terms of volume, it's not significant in terms of impact to our full year gross margin. We have now said that our gross margin will be flat to down slightly. Previously it was flat to up slightly. Distribution costs are also a factor in there, though, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just to be clear, there's nothing that's really changed since you announced -- initiated Project K that would sort of change your gross margin sort of goals longer-term?","Ronald L. Dissinger","That's correct.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Guys, I think you said that the 2014 inflation would be positive and it's in line with your initial expectations, but that the second half of '14 would be more favorable than the front half. And then, moving into 2015, Ron, I think you said in your script you used the word benign. I kind of take that as 0. Big picture are we finally kind of entering the tipping point, where cost savings are well ahead of the inflation? And how will you spend the net savings?","Ronald L. Dissinger","So David, our cost savings in 2014 are ahead of inflation for the full year. I said for the full year, we do expect slight net deflation. And as I've said all along this year, that net deflation is more pronounced, obviously, in the second half of the year. So we saw a little bit of net deflation in the third quarter, and a little bit of net deflation in the fourth quarter as well, and that's helping us to manage our guidance from an operating profit standpoint.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you make a comment on '15, given you're mentioning that this inflation was benign? So that's more favorable than what's been going on? I mean, it's -- and I mean, I don't want to read too much in this, but is that accurate?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Well, so from a material inflation standpoint, what I said was it's more benign. I think the thing to remember, David, is there are a number of other things that can impact our inflation or cost structure. That includes transportation and logistics cost. It includes factory costs as well. So I prefer to give you more robust guidance when we get down to the fourth quarter call. But for now, what we're seeing is a relatively benign commodity inflation.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","We're watching oil plummet. So I feel like that sounds like it should be a fun call in the fourth quarter. I'll leave it there and pass it on.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Your European segment margin, it's been pretty steady this year, around the 12% area. That's obviously a nice improvement year-over-year and perhaps fueled in part by still getting synergies out of Pringles. Where do you see that division margin going over time? Can you continue to drive margins meaningfully higher with similar revenue trends?","Ronald L. Dissinger","So we have had good performance in our European margin this year. Input costs are a factor there. We've seen lower input cost versus prior year and in addition, very strong productivity savings. Obviously, we have a goal to grow our Europe operating margins over time. We haven't cited specifically a goal at this point in time, but we do believe there's opportunity for improvement in those margins.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just separately, one more. On Kashi, are you getting any positive responses on the specific SKUs where you're reformulating the product in -- from the consumer or the trade? Does it feel like there's a turn coming with that brand, either in velocity or shelf space?","John A. Bryant","As with Kashi, we are getting some positive responses from retailers about putting Kashi back in California, putting a dedicated team around it. And retailers are very excited to work with us to get that business back into growth. Having said that, we have seen some disruption losses through the year on Kashi. And unfortunately, that's going to continue to weigh upon that business, even as we go into 2015. I think it's going to take some time as we take that brand more broadly, GMO free, and we have some additional USDA organic SKUs coming in. But I don't think renovating the food alone is going to be enough. I think we're going to bring out some new innovation, bring out some new foods and truly get on the front edge, leading edge of pioneering nutrition. We have a new team that's tremendously excited to do that. A lot of energy around this. But unfortunately, it's going to take some time for us to see improved trends in the Kashi business.","Operator","And the next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry, but a couple of questions. I guess, first, Ron, your annual target this year implies an $0.08 range. Can you just talk a little bit about what would put you, for the fourth quarter, either at the high end or the low end of that?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, Eric. I mean, obviously, our business is very sensitive to top line performance. So if there's anything that's going to drive towards the high end or the low end of that range, it's going to be top line performance.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, maybe for John. The -- how much -- I think this is -- maybe it's the second quarter or third quarter in a row, where Pop-Tarts have been down materially. It's 80% share, it's got to be one of your most profitable businesses. Like how much of that is playing a role in kind of the morning or even North American profits being under pressure? And kind of what gives you the confidence that, that business, which I think by your -- as you've stated before, has been up for something like 40 years in a row? What should give us the confidence that, that can rebound?","John A. Bryant","Eric, as you say, Pop-Tarts is a great business. It's been a long-term growth. The last 2 quarters, we have been soft in Pop-Tarts, largely because in the prior-year period, we were very strong behind the peanut butter launch, as we got tremendous in-store display and execution. This year, our Pop-Tarts innovation is more later in the year. Sort of a peanut butter and jelly Pop-Tart coming out in the fourth quarter, which we expect to hear some good support behind as well. So it really had to do with comparisons. If you were to go back and compare it to the business 2 years ago, it's still doing reasonably well. So it's really a year-on-year comp issue.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, sorry, the last question. You've been very public through most of this year about the problems with Special K and Kashi. And obviously, you're about to, it sounds like, completely redo the brand. So is this kind of transition period here-- Like, does that explain the fact that, that business sounds like it's just been kind of as it currently stands, falling off a cliff and responsible for so much of the underperformance in the North America operation?","John A. Bryant","I think we're clearly struggling with Special K in the U.S. this year. But quite frankly, Special K in all of the large markets has been -- developed markets, has been struggling. What's happening there is, we have communicated Special K around dieting, lose weight over a 2-week period and we really need to move that to a weight wellness discussion, really away from reduced calories to the food itself has tremendous nutrient benefits. That requires us to change their communications, to focus on that, but also to make some food improvements, which is what we're doing in cereal, in Special K bars, in cracker chips. And until we get some of that new food out there, while the communication shift will help us, really the competition shift in combination with the food in combination with new consumer promotions and packaging, that whole relaunch element was required to get the excitement around the brand, to drive reappraisal, to bring people back into what is a tremendous franchise. I think the softness we're seeing in the third quarter is greater than we've seen year-to-date, But quite frankly, we've seen the softness through the first half of the year as well.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So John, I appreciate that you're a cereal company at your core, but you've assembled a pretty formidable snack business over the years. Cereal category's clearly soft across a number of your markets? And John you seem to suggest this is driven by a fad or trend that may just need to run its course. Meanwhile, snack's a growth year. So I see your slide on plans for 2015. It looks like around 90% of these initiatives you detail adhere to breakfast. And I hear you talking about curtailing brand building overall, but ramping at high single digits in Morning Foods. So my question is why are these the right investment priorities? I'm not suggesting you put cereal in outright harvest mode? But why isn't every incremental dollar going to your snack portfolio to turn that around and ride the wave that's in front of you now?","John A. Bryant","Jason, a great question. We have 45% cereal, 45% snacks today. And as we look at the 2015 plans, while the slide might suggest more of a focus on cereal, in reality we are investing back in both of our businesses and we have some brands that actually cross both businesses. So the investment in Special K and cereal actually also helps the snacks business as well. So as we look at the cereal business, look at 2015, we're going to continue to invest in the cereal business. But I wouldn't want you to believe that we are going to disproportionately invest back into the cereal business. We'll be investing back behind growth in Pringles. We're investing back behind the growth we're seeing in that cracker portfolio in the U.S. And so we have some great growth opportunity as we go forward here. So I'd say it's a balanced investment in growth across the portfolio.","Operator","And the next question comes from Diane Geissler from CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask about takeaway versus shipments. I appreciate it's been challenging in the grocery aisles with increased merchandising from categories that traditionally haven't received as much merchandising support from the retailers. So could you just talk about, particularly within North America, and in your key categories, what you're seeing shipments versus consumer take away?","John A. Bryant","Looking in the U.S. DST system is normally-- shipments in consumption tend to marry up pretty closely. So I wouldn't say there's anything to flag there. I think on Frozen Foods maybe a little bit of shipment ahead of consumption as we launch some new products. But we feel good about the programs we have there. And then on cereal, we ended the quarter with a little bit more inventory than last year but we expect to end the year with the same amount of inventory as we had last year.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about -- actually following on from Jason's question about where to allocate resources. Is there a broader question about portfolio shift here that is about maybe trying to acquire or increase your exposure to snacks, which is a growth category over time, both in the U.S. and globally? And maybe deemphasizing the cereal category really depends on how structurally challenged you believe the cereal category is? But how do you think about portfolio shift over the longer term?","John A. Bryant","Alexia, I think if you go back over the last decade or so, we've taken the company from being 70% cereal to 45% cereal, 45% snacks. That's been driven by both the Keebler acquisition, as well as the Pringles acquisition. And as you look at the growth strategy for the company going forward, we have 4 growth platforms. One is to continue to grow our breakfast business around cereal. The second is to continue with our snacks business. The third is to grow our Frozen Foods business here in North America. And the fourth one is to continue to expand our emerging market platform. As you think about our growth priorities going forward, clearly snacks is an important growth priority for us, and we'll continue to expand that over time. And that may intersect also that emerging market growth objective as well. So we'd expect us to continue to grow our snacks business. However, I wouldn't see this as an alternative. We have to grow cereal or snacks. I think it's an add strategy, we can do both. Clearly, it's not the right thing to do, to only invest disproportionally in one versus the other. We already spent a lot of money in brand building in cereal. In fact, the reason the company has a high percentage of sales in brand building is because the cereal category is one of the most brand building intensive categories in the food industry. So there's a lot of a brand building investment already behind cereal. And the key there is to sustain that investment that and to continue to improve the quality of ideas and execution, and bring those foods increasingly on trend with what consumers are looking for. On snacks, we have an opportunity to keep growing that business over time. I'm excited by our growth in snacks, particularly since Pringles acquisition, which has truly ignited the international snack growth opportunity that we have as a company.","Operator","And that question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, I wanted to touch on North America, and you reported a negative price mix there for the segment in Q3, and I think appreciatively negative. And just on your history that's pretty unusual. So just wondering if maybe you can elaborate on that in terms of, is there anything one-time in there or any sub-segment driving that impact? Or even if it's just -- we should consider that going forward as sustainable?","Ronald L. Dissinger","There's a little bit of business mix in there. So for example, wholesome snacks is down. That has an impact on our mix of performance. John also commented on within the North America Other segment, which includes Canada and Frozen Foods, some cost to launch new product and there was a little bit of channel mix in there as well. And then we also talked about the effectiveness or efficiency of trade investment John talked briefly about merchandising. So those are the items that are impacting us specifically in this quarter, John.","John A. Bryant","I think, over time, we would not like to see negative price mix in the North American segment.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So this is more of a temporary issue then?","John A. Bryant","I think it has more to do with the timing of some innovation launches in some of our products. And also, just as Ron said, some business mix. If you're looking at each individual business, you wouldn't necessarily get the same pattern as if you look at a consolidated segment.","Simon Burton","Okay, everyone, thanks for joining us today. We appreciate it. We'll be around the next couple of days for any follow-ups.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a nice day."],"12498":["Kellogg Co. (NYSE:K) Q3 2016 Earnings Call November  1, 2016  9:00 AM ET","Executives","John Renwick - Kellogg Co.","John A.

Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick - Kellogg Co.","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter 2016 results.

The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","And now, I'll turn it over to John and slide number 4.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was part of this over-delivery, but so was broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top-line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we will discuss in a moment. But we do see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business.","Behind the numbers, there is great progress being made, not only against our strategy as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you one year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3. And we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in operating profit, albeit driven more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth.","And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat, and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela.","Today, Ron, the region presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook, and we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K. I'll start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on slide 5.","There are two important points to make here. First, that this Growth Plan is informing our investment decisions and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan.","The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat front-and-center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target.","So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K one year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set out to stabilize our four largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities. And we have made substantial progress in all but the UK, which is a work in progress.","Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we are growing organically in these emerging markets as well.","Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled Revenue Growth Management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization and we've seen that price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4.","Also, regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest-ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores.","Increasing earnings visibility through big productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year. And it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives. We're shifting our brand-building to higher RIO brands and investments and we're starting to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made, even if our top-line has not yet reflected it.","With that, let me turn it over to Ron, who will take you through our financial results, progress and outlook.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, all. Slide number 7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter. In describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.","Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal.","Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact.","Now, let's turn to slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter. And this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in UK cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overall Kasha and Morning Star Farms portfolios.","The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.","Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was off 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year, even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in Snacks, driven by softness in our Wholesome Snacks business.","Offsetting this strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retail environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting, and the roll-out of Revenue Growth Management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward.","Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based with operating margin up year-on-year in all four of our regions.","Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow through the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period, and recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full-year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full-year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and prioritization of projects.","Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis, so that we can move volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our ex-Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends have led us to adjust our outlook, so instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%.","Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018.","On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share report repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil.","A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year; net, the acquisition is neutral to our comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs were expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously-announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year.","Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance. And I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability primarily from the adoption of the new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year.","Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And, as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases, for the time being, to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full-year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03, net of tax. And this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing and integration costs for the Brazil acquisition.","Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price mix performance as we employ Revenue Growth Management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent, in our view, even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis-point challenge through 2018.","As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation; Revenue Growth Management to improve our price mix contribution; Project K savings; and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond.","Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018 and shows how this shapes up across our four regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year on the accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more-developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large as we are still in early stages of scaling up emerging markets in these regions.","Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it two years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives by being fiscally proven and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we've made good progress towards our financial goals.","We're now going to turn it over to each of our region presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses.","We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Ron. Good morning, everyone. No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I had hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest.","If we turn to slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you one year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category has held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We have prioritized investment behind our core brands. And we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.","We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big three cracker brands. We're growing Pringles. And we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double-digit in on-the-go offerings.","Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contributing to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.","Fuel for Growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins; from executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model, to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting. We are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to Revenue Growth Management, which is already showing positive signs.","So, with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on slide number 19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. And our Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%. So shipments clearly lagged consumption in the quarter.","Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in Cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core six Cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S'Mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.","We executed well during the back-to-school period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation. And it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business.","As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion, resulting in strong operating profit growth.","Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the four ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago: firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority; brands that matter, namely our core six Cereal brands and Pop-Tarts; thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, Revenue Growth Management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago.","If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on Cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We'll also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of Vanilla-Almond.","On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have two new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1.","Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with Crackers, where our big three cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club, and Town House continued to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continued to grow sales and share and Nutri-Grain also picked up share.","Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and Cracker Chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales.","So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on Revenue Growth Management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too.","Turning to 2017 on slide 22, for Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they will continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand-building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new occasions through expanded distribution.","Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers, as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called LOUD. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small format offerings, which we know are highly incremental.","Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize Wholesome Snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars behind new food, packaging and communication, and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also.","Revenue Growth Management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals.","Now, let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all three of our core channels: foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in four of seven categories in foodservice, in three of five in vending, and in five of seven in convenience.","This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited-time offering on Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like Whole-Grain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-Its. Meanwhile, Revenue Growth Management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4, with a strong finish to the year across all channels.","Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom-line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels.","We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked custom granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through Revenue Growth Management and ZBB, with K&A's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017.","Lastly, we'll discuss our North America Other segment, which is comprised of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada, and Kashi and is shown on slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results were as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and feature prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure.","The rest of North America, however, is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions would be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney licensed products, but this was more than offset by the impact of distribution lost on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging.","At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal share in measured channels as well as a plus 5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold and we really haven't turned on broad scale consumer communication yet. So Cereal is on its way, even if it is still down year-on-year. However, Wholesome Snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued; proactive renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017.","Let's look ahead to 2017 on slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the rewards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top-line growth in this North America Other segment.","Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB, as well as lapping some heavy investment in food, should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth, as distribution has stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well. And we have an excellent new GoLean variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong.","Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be Wholesome Snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming early in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the Wholesome Snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year.","In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo with new, taste-oriented communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on-shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year. Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year and, as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion.","So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend, enhancing our capabilities and execution and improving profitability. While our top-line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018.","With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe.","Chris Hood - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva. For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We returned Wholesome Snacks to growth. We stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region. And we're growing net sales in five of our six geographic clusters. The one exception is UK Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales. The UK's a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran, and this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market.","But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. A good way to assess this progress is slide number 28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you one year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal was stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year.","Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the UK business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe and that was a priority for this year.","Pringles has been a big success as we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued high single-digit growth, with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks four years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand. And we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and accessing new occasions in new markets via additional sizes and geographic expansion.","Wholesome Snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress, despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date and our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Foods, are both growing at a rapid clip as well.","As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K, implementation of shared services, getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting where we're about a year behind North America, and implementing Revenue Growth Management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last four years.","So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the UK on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top-line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion.","Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were up slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the UK. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our sub-regions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth. And Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets, while sustaining strong Pringles momentum.","As we go into Q4, we will work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands. And we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives.","Turning the slide number 30, here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the UK. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business.","We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently-launched on-trend offerings like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced, commercial plan. And we're using Revenue Growth Management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing. With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on UK Cereal during 2017 with continued decline, albeit at a moderated pace.","Pringles still has plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017, and executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus. Delivering our expected savings from Project K, Global Business Services and Zero-Based Budgeting are all critical to enabling the investment in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact.","In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots of sales recovery. And we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow Snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points.","With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America.","Maria Fernanda Mejia - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan and we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in cereal while expanding our snacks footprint. And we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But, as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment.","When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress, as shown on slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets, our record shares in wholesome snacks in Brazil and Colombia and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand, growing double-digit. And our most recent introductions for Special K Protein cereal and nut bars are exceeding our expectations.","We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores, while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past three years.","We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed-to-market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, [KIM] and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds, so great progress being made across our priorities.","A driver of market expansion will be M&A. And one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on slide 33. Our recently-announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than double our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%.","And we substantially increase our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about a third. This is a company that plays in attractive categories with strong brands and a track record of growth. It's largely regional, with its foothold in the south, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. Its strength in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brands.","Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter three. We saw growth in both Cereal and in Snacks, and the growth was broad-based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization.","For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our share for the cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions, and we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela.","We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores and this, despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margins in the fourth quarter should continue to be higher, due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently-launched ZBB initiative.","On slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017. And everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in Cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand-building and exciting opportunities behind our growing Snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly, given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses.","Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size. Effective promotions, while driving mix, will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path towards supply change optimization with step changes ahead.","So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points.","And with this, I'll turn it over to Amit Banati, President of Asia Pacific, currently in Singapore.","Amit Banati - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Maria Fernanda, and good morning; well, evening for me from Singapore. We are having a good year in Kellogg Asia Pacific. Our top-line growth has a consistent, led by Pringles and emerging markets, and our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher and we have plans to increase them further. And, most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and these will make Asia Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come.","One slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia Pacific that had been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about two-thirds of the region sales. Snacks now accounts for about one-third of the region's sales.","We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in Cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. After two years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall and India is recovering in the second half. And in Sub-Saharan Africa, we are seeing strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria.","Slide 38 discusses our quarter three performance and how we see quarter four shaping up. We continued to post increased sales in quarter three, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereal business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the cereal category. The drivers of improved performance include: our renovation to four-star food of our biggest brand, Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the number one innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in store.","Our Pringles business had a strong quarter three, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovation expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region.","Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter three. Quarter three sales growth was impacted by Korea lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our Snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia Snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter four. This will result in fully outpaced growth in the low single-digit range.","Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate, despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results.","We have strong plans for 2017 represented on slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein Bites and Nutri-Grain EDGE bars and they are both off to a strong start. We have also relaunched the Be Natural brand with new food and packaging.","Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch wholesome snacks in South Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringle sales in the region. 2017 will also see an increased focused on driving operating margin expansion as we roll-out Zero-Based Budgeting and Revenue Growth Management.","In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures, in effect, bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit, and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Amit. Let me wrap up with slide 41 and a few key messages I'd like to leave you with today. We are making clear progress toward our priorities. We are doing what we said we'd do, and this will lead to continued improvement in our financial performance. We are disappointed by our recent sales performance, but improving underlying fundamentals points to sequential improvement in Q4 and 2017.","We have unprecedented earnings visibility. That's because of our productivity programs, like Project K and ZBB. It's because of Revenue Growth Management and it's because of a refreshed Volume to Value operating model. And we have increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of raising our operating profit margin by 250 basis points from 2015 through 2018.","I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication. And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. First, real quick housekeeping item, Ron, how was your advertising spend tracking year-to-date just so we can get a bead in sort of underlying SG&A and the efficiency that's being squeezed out there?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, first, Jason, let me remind you we're committed to investing in our brands and our food, and we invest at industry-leading levels. And we had very strong pressure in the third quarter as well. The fact is Zero-Based Budgeting highlighted some opportunities for us from an efficiency and an effectiveness standpoint to ensure that we're investing with impact into our business.","For example, we found opportunities in agency fees, so the non-working elements of our brand-building and also in production costs. And, as you know, the model to build brands in the marketplace today certainly is evolving. Now in the third quarter, we saw our brand-building as a percent of sales down about a point. So we did have some money come out, but remember we're investing back into our foods in conjunction with that.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Quick follow-up then for Paul, if we still have him on the line; Paul, not unlike the industry at large, we're seeing an algorithm for your growth in North America be accompanied by lower A&P and a bit more pull on the pricing lever. We're starting to see price gaps from private label widening out a bit. How do you guys think about defending against private label encroachment as you're trying to get prices higher, at the same time pulling back on some of the traditional brand-building levers?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Jason. I think it's a good point regarding our private label brands. I mean, our focus is clear on investing in our brands, first and foremost. So you probably heard me say it on several occasions, investing behind our biggest brands, be that our big three crackers, our core six cereals, Rice Krispies Treats, the Eggo brand, the Pop-Tart brand, investing in the food in ways that continuously improve our offerings, sometimes that's removing things people want less of, sometimes that's putting more in what people want more of, like red berries, for example, in Special K. Those are the things that allow branded companies like ours and our big brands to compete and play effectively for consumers' pocketbooks in the marketplace.","So my focus is very much in improving our foods, bigger better ideas, and driving our investment behind those things. Now how you invest, whether it's old school television or whether it's more socially-driven, I think that's what all of us are working towards. So it doesn't mean that you invest like you always did to get the return you always got. You can be more efficient and effective in the ways you go forward.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Jason, if I could just add to that, I think if you look around the world, in general, private label shares are not doing well in our categories. So we're holding our own. In fact, we're doing better than private label in the majority of our categories around the world. I mean, I would strongly disagree with the comment of pulling back on brand-building. We're absolutely committed to brand-building. We spend at industry-leading levels. We can be more efficient at doing it, and that's where the Zero-Based Budgeting benefits are coming through.","And we can change how we spend brand-building to next generation marketing more. That's what Paul was referring to in terms of spending more on digital and less on, say, traditional TV-type advertising programs. So we're absolutely committed to driving strong brands and we think we can do it more efficiently and effectively over time.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I guess I wanted to take kind of a step back on, John, your international investments. You've made now two more medium-sized, I guess, acquisitions in emerging markets. And I just kind of went back and I looked at the profitability of your international business, and it really has not moved, even if I go back maybe even 13 years. Maybe Europe is a little better, but Latin America way down. The promise of international for Kellogg has been around for a long time, and I was hoping you could kind of take a step back and give us some perspective as to why has it not developed the way maybe you would've hoped over the past 10 years? And so, why double-down on it now to try to reignite it and even in some countries where the visibility, like in Africa, is pretty low?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","I think a few things give us great confidence in our ability to grow internationally going forward. One, if you go back to our 2020 growth strategy, emerging market expansion was a big part of that strategy, and you're seeing us make that a reality. We have invested actually in all three of our international regions with emerging market acquisitions or joint ventures in the last year or two years.","We've made significant investments in Nigeria, helping us open up Africa. We've made two acquisitions in Egypt, helping us expand the Mediterranean Middle East region. And we made a very important acquisition in Brazil earlier this year, which transforms that marketplace for us. All these elements help us build a larger emerging market footprint within our company. It's also worth highlighting that Pringles has changed the nature of our emerging markets business from being focused on cereal, to also having the ability to drive snacks expansion.","Pringles has certainly helped us make that a reality within the emerging markets. So as we go forward, we think we are increasingly well-positioned to get better growth, both on the top line and on margin expansion, as you heard from the international area presidents here this morning.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Could I ask a follow-up? Can you give us an update on the profitability of the Nigerian acquisition? As I look through the JV line, I don't see any profits flowing through. Is there something more to it?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Rob, it's Ron. The Nigeria investment is making money. There are a number of other things that are flowing through that line, other joint venture investments, including China and a small joint venture in Turkey as well, but we are profitable in Nigeria. And as you heard from Amit, we got very strong sales growth within that market as well.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Is it meeting its objectives for 2016?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Amit, do you want to talk about the performance of the Nigerian business?","Amit Banati - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, sure. So we are driving strong double-digit growth on our JV in Nigeria. Despite the economic challenges in the market, margins are largely flat. I think the investment that we made in Multipro, it was a distribution business, so largely local in nature, which has allowed us to continue to hold margins, despite the challenging economic environment. And broadly, seeing very strong growth in the business and are on track with the initial acquisition case.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Good morning.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. I just had two questions, if I could; the first would be in the past, you've given kind of at least a preliminary indication for EPS growth for the coming year. Are there any nuances maybe, Ron, that we should think about for EPS growth for the coming year?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Well, it's a little early from a currency standpoint, Chris, for us to give guidance on how currencies may impact our business. So that's one thing that we'll need to consider and certainly the impact that Brexit has had on the sterling. The other thing is you heard me communicate on the call here that we expect our tax rate this year to be about 25%. So we'll be lapping that as we move into 2017.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, just a question for you overall on Revenue Growth Management and the way that we should expect that to kind of feed into revenue growth going forward, is there an immediate effect on volume, maybe a negative effect on volume, for instance, that we're not seeing made up for in the form of higher pricing and mix? Like this quarter, I expected to see price and mix higher. I think in most divisions, actually, it was lower. Is that still to come? Is that the way to look at that?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Yes. What I would tell you, Chris, is that our Revenue Growth Management work is in its early stages and it's unfolding. We're a bit more developed in some of the U.S. businesses versus our international markets. But where it's progressing well, though \u2013 remember what I said in the opening remarks is that we expect, as we go through 2017, 2018, volume to be down and price mix to be improving. Some of this work takes time before you see it unfold within the profit and loss statement. And let me remind you there are a number of different areas that we're taking a look at.","First of all, our trade investment and the efficiency and effectiveness of that trade investment. We're also looking at pack sizes to make sure we have the right pricing structures in pack sizes on shelf, and then we're doing things around mix management. So it takes time to work that from consumer to shelf through the customer and then back into our business. But we'll see that unfold in 2017 and 2018 as well, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And has that been in place, revenue management in North America, throughout 2016 or was it phased in through the year?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Phased in through the year.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","I'd say, again, it's still pretty early days for us on Revenue Growth Management. So I think you're seeing better performance in Q3 than the front half of this year. We expect Q4 to be slightly better again, but this is not a sudden shift. This is a build-up over time of the various work we're doing in this area","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","I think Deanie highlighted some examples on the last call of how we're beginning to see some improved performance in Cheez-It come through and we are getting the benefits of the work, but we started with Cheez-It. We're now moving across other brands.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the time today.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","You talked at Day at K last year about some of the investing in cookies and the repertoire portfolio and unlocking some of that potential, but it hasn't really been one of the ones you've talked about, the Keebler brand specifically. What's the status there? Is that still something that you see as an opportunity? How do you think about that evolving in your snacks portfolio?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Michael. That's a great question. If you look at the Keebler brand in the third quarter, our sales, our consumption was down about 0.8 of a percent and our share is stable. We reinvested in the brand in about March this year with brand-building advertising and also some food innovation, which is coming through now. And we've seen base sales in the third quarter up almost 6% in the marketplace in the third quarter. And in the more recent data, it's continuing to grow.","So we do have a tail within our cookie portfolio that we're working on, though, specifically, the Keebler brand, we feel good about the Keebler brand. And the team has done a great job. I mean, the brand is stabilizing in consumption, like I say, and we're seeing good baseline sales growth, and a little bit of price from a unit point of view coming through, which is positive. I just didn't mention it today.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on wholesome snacks, you talked about that being under more pressure both in the U.S. and Australia. But in Europe, you've cited that as an area of strength. What are some of the differences there? And how transferable are some of the things you're doing in Europe into other markets?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Maybe I'll just talk more broadly about wholesome snacks. I think when we have our food on trend that is in line with the positioning of the brand, we do very well. And it's some of the great work that Chris and the team in Europe have done around relaunching some Special K food that is more on trend with where that brand is going. I think you're seeing some good response.","I think we still have some work to do in some of our markets around the world to ensure that the food really is delivering against the promise of the brand. And we have those plans in place and you'll see more innovation coming out against that in 2017. Paul, do you want to add any comments?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, I would say if you look at the U.S. business, Rice Krispies Treats has grown sales and share. Nutri-Grain's hanging in there and growing some share in the category as well. Our drag has been the Special K brand and some of those legacy foods as John mentioned that are probably off trend and more kind of linked towards diet. We have a significant restage coming in Q1 2017, with I think eight new foods around Special K brand and also around the Nutri-Grain brand as we seek to stabilize that part of our business next year overall. So it will take significant investment in food as the starting point to stabilizing that business.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And just in Europe, did it never really have as much of a diet positioning or does it not have that hole to dig out of? What's working in Europe that's unique?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Let me say some comments and I'll hand it over to Chris. There has been some new innovation. The positioning of Special K in Europe was very much against that traditional weight management positioning, and that is something we're looking to evolve over time. Chris, you want to talk more about the Wholesome Snacks performance in Europe?","Chris Hood - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, sure. I mean, I think there's some rejuvenation on the Special K bars, as John has referenced, but the other thing that's driving our results in Europe is the introduction of Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars, which are on-trend, very tasty foods that we launched into the UK this past year and we're now expanding more broadly across Europe. So that's been the other driver.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much, guys. Just a quick one; Paul, you talked about you maybe being a little ahead of in Snacking in North America versus where you are in maybe getting Cereal turned around. I'm trying to understand. I've asked this before, years go, but I'm trying to get caught up here. Can you give us a sense of the difference in contribution margins between those two products and if there's there a significant negative profit mix if Snacking does a little bit better than Cereal? And any way of quantifying that both this year and maybe going forward so we can understand what kind of base you're working with as you just get generally more efficient? Thanks.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Hey, Jonathan. Well, I won't point to specific margin structure of the different categories within the Snacks business or Cereal business. I would tell you, and I mentioned this in the opening remarks, our Wholesome Snacks business has strong margins. And as that business has been soft for us, that's had an impact on our business performance and our gross margin as well. When you look across the Cereal business broadly, our Morning Foods broadly and Snacks broadly, the overall gross margin structures and contribution structures are pretty comparable.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one housekeeping and then just one question; in terms of the revenue guidance change today, just how much was the cereal inventory, the unexpected inventory reductions, have the effect on the revenue guidance? Just trying to get a sense of if that that didn't happen, would you have needed to reduce your revenue outlook?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","This is Ron, Bryan. Looking at the current trends, we probably would have reduced our revenue outlook, but that trade inventory reduction was significant in Morning Foods. There was a big difference between our shipments and our consumption. And from recollection, it was about a half a point or a little bit more within the quarter.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And that's now past you, meaning it won't be a drag going forward, right?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","It won't be a drag going forward, and we didn't plan that inventory to come back into the business either. So we took a prudent approach to how we expect the balance of the year to unfold.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","So just to clarify, just to add some more to that, I think our consumption this year on cereal is down about 1%. Our shipments are probably down a couple hundred basis points more than that this year in U.S. So it would be our expectation and so the half point that Ron was referring to before was the total company net sales impact in Q3.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Yes. That's correct.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Ron, I think earlier, maybe on the 2Q earnings call, you talked about Project K delivering about $100 million of savings this year and then ZBB was, I think, $150 million to $180 million. So is that still the range? Has any of that changed for 2016? And then, as we look at 2017, is the incremental impact from Project K and ZBB similar or more or less than this year? Just trying to understand maybe what drives the margin expansion next year if it's different, if it builds differently in 2017 than 2016?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","Absolutely. So let's start first with 2016. Project K is on track in delivering against its financial objectives. We communicated approximately $100 million worth of savings and we're still on track for that number. Zero-Based Budgeting, the latest update I had provided was that our Zero-Based Budgeting savings in 2016 would be in the range of $150 million to $180 million. Now, we are hitting more towards the top end of that range, maybe even a little bit above that range as we look at our most recent outlook for the year. So we're seeing very good performance from Zero-Based Budgeting.","Now, let's move that into 2017. And I did provide an update at the Barclays conference, if you wanted to refer to some charts there, you'd see it on the charts as well. But Project K, balance of the program to hit the $425 million to $475 million worth of savings, so roughly $140 million to $190 million of savings over the next couple years, 2017 and 2018, to hit that range. And we have said that more than half of that savings would come in 2017.","When you look at Zero-Based Budgeting savings and the way we've outlined it, it's roughly a third, a third, a third unfolding in in 2016, 2017 and 2018. So the savings are pretty comparable.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Kellogg Co.","You bet.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So can I ask just as a follow-up to what Bryan was asking about with the unexpected trade inventory reductions, in U.S. Cereal, was that predominantly driven by reduced shelf space being allocated by the retailers? And I guess within that, is the strategy for 2017 to really focus in your six core cereal brands and maybe to allow shelf space to be reduced on the non-core brands? And do you expect to get back to sales growth in U.S. Cereals in 2017? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","I'll get that. Hi, Alexia. No, will be the answer to the first part of the question, that it was not linked to any reduction in space by any of our retailers. I think we were carrying maybe a little bit of incremental inventory through the first part of the year and it came out in the third quarter. We're trying to be, as Ron said, cautious and not planning to come back necessarily in the final part of the year. Regarding the core six, our strategy is to drive the core six hard. And that means investment in food. That means investment in great ideas, and that means really working our core assortment across all retail environments extremely hard, so that we get the maximum out of those brands. We also need to turn Kashi back to growth next year as well. If we do those things, I think we can be optimistic about the sequential improvement track in front of us in Cereal as a company and in Cereal as a category back towards flat or better in 2017.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Steven.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","I want to follow up on Alexia's question and bring us back to like a bigger picture view on cereal innovation in the category. If we rewind the clock back a few quarters and think about how you and Mills and a few of the other guys in the industry were thinking about category growth rate at the start of the year, you would have said something about like flat to low single digits, driven by gluten-free, artificial-free, all these different forms of incremental innovation. What do you think, at the end of the day, stopped us short of reaching that goal? Was it food deflation, something in consumer behavior? But bottom line, what do we need to see to bring incremental users to the category?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Maybe I could start and then hand it over to Paul to add any more comments. So I think earlier this year, I was asked if I thought U.S. Cereal would grow in 2016. And I said, yes, I thought we would. And part of that was the improvement we're seeing over the last three or four years in consumption trends in cereal, particularly in our business. And if you look at consumption in 2017, we're going to end up down about 1%. That's actually a significant improvement over prior years, not quite where I hoped we'd get to, but we're certainly trending in the right direction.","Our shipments might end up being 100, 200 basis points less than that because we are expecting a full-year trade inventory reduction in the Cereal business based on what we saw in the third quarter. So I think we're heading in the right direction. Was I a little bit maybe too optimistic we'd get there in 2016, perhaps, but I think as Paul said, we get to 2017, we expect to see the continued improvement. And it's going to come through by engaging consumers with great food, engaging them with the brands, bringing it to life in store, a whole variety of factors that we know historically have driven the Cereal business performance.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Just to follow up on that. Just wanted to see what is the greatest lift that you're seeing? Give us a tangible example of what really moves the needle most within the Cereal category, whether it's putting ingredient quality back into the box or is it the merchandising or the trade? I know it's probably a little bit of all of this, but what, in your view, when you think reinvesting Zero-Based Budgeting savings, what gives you that best incremental pop or ROI, so to speak?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Okay. Well, if you think about Cereal, each brand is different so what makes one brand react might be different from another. We clearly saw a reinvestment in our core foods around, say, Special K red berries, which is a significant part of our lineup. Turn the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year, K is growing and growing share. We've seen Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation, but because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility and I think that's driving that brand.","Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year so and that again I would say is driven by in-store activation behind big properties; properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics event. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand.","When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We put it back in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point of purchase. So sometimes, it's behind the brand. Sometimes, it's focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store, and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't cereal, but that was a choice coming out of ZBB reinvestment. And we've seen positive returns on that.","So I do think it comes down to core six brands and the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel 4% to 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in mainstream measures channels as well next year. We do that plus the core six, I think you'll see the category flatten out and maybe tip into growth.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Paul, I'd like to come back to the comment about the prolonged transition on shelf for Kashi. I wonder if you can elaborate a bit in terms of how much is internal execution relative to just a more challenging environment for natural organic overall and maybe what changes you're making from here?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John. That's a great question. Let me start off by saying, in all openness and honesty, I'm disappointed by our performance in Q3. I did expect a little more progress than we got. We started, as you know, 18 months ago, we put our team back out in California. And that team has been extremely focused on getting our food right. So we have completely renovated all of our foods to be Non-GMO Project Verified and about 30% to 40% of our portfolio is now organic. So we've done a lot of the fundamentals of getting the food right, in particular in our biggest business.","We then decided to exit some categories, frozen pizzas for example. And we're getting out of things that we don't think are a good fit for the Kashi brand. And we turned our attention to innovating and renovating aggressively on our Wholesome Snacks business, which, as John mentioned earlier, Wholesome Snacks is again all about getting the food right.","As we look at consumer reaction to Kashi, we're getting good reaction, a lot of positive social reaction to the brand, which means I feel confident about the equity. I think our foods are all getting back on trend. I think, and this is the important bit, you're right. With great execution, which I think we can improve on, we will return this business to growth. So I think there's a journey we're on here and we need to turn up execution because I think all the other elements are coming together.","We have brand new communication about to hit early next year. It would have been great if we could have got that out a bit earlier, but we're getting to where we want to get to. We just need to execute now.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Paul. And just a follow-up, more broadly in terms of your emerging markets outlook through 2018, you're targeting margin expansion in both Lat Am and AP. Yet, it also sounds as though there's quite a bit of heavy lifting ahead in terms of investments in new and existing territories. Can you speak to maybe where your resources are right now in terms of people investments, brands spending and otherwise relative to target? And what gives you the confidence you can grow margins even as investment increases?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Well, I think as you look around the world, you look at our margin expansion goals, they are more in Europe and North America. So not surprisingly, that's where more of the heavy lifting is from a margin expansion perspective. But even in the emerging markets, we do expect to see margin expansion. We expect to see that because a lot of the initiatives that we have underway. So I'm going to hand it over to Maria Fernanda and to Amit briefly just to talk about some of the things they're doing to drive margins in their regions, starting with Maria Fernanda, then to Amit.","Maria Fernanda Mejia - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Thank you, John. So much of our focus around our historical profit margins has been due to investing in emerging markets, investing in Snacks and HFS. I think this year, the focus in moving toward our targets, we are expecting significant productivity progress, as I mentioned, continuing to optimize and streamline our supply chain, focusing on lowering our total delivered costs. Certainly KIM has been quite significant for us, improving our margins in Latin America as well as RGM and ZBB and Project K.","So I think we've demonstrated great discipline in the execution of Project K. And moving forward, we'll transfer that discipline to our ZBB efforts, which we're already starting to see flow through second half of this year, as well as Revenue Growth Management. We talked about several years ago, we set the portfolio right in Latin America. We're focusing our efforts behind those core brands. And looking at total commercial investment through the lens of RGM, I think will help enhance those margins and optimizing our overhead through continued Project K.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Maria.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Amit, do you want to add anything?","Amit Banati - Kellogg Co.","Yes. From an Asia Pac standpoint, we're rolling out similar to Latin America, we're rolling out a number of initiatives to drive margin, including Zero-Based Budgeting and RGM, which will enable us to expand margins by around 100 to 200 basis points by 2018, while also providing the fuel to invest behind our 2020 Growth Plan. And as we had outlined in our 2020 Growth Plan, we're focused on doubling our snacks business in the region, doubling our business in Asia and on scaling up Africa.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just a high-level question on the European margins, there's still to be a fairly wide variance between North America and European margins. Is there an opportunity to actually narrow that gap, even as North American margins go higher and would you expect the cadence of ZBB to accelerate in Europe as well?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Well, let me just say before handing it over to Chris to talk about some of the things we're doing in Europe and great progress in terms of expanding margins over the last few years and how that will progress, let me say that, in general, I think European food companies operate at a lower operating margin than North American food companies. So I don't think that's unique to Kellogg. I think it's pretty standard out there, but, Chris, anything you want to add on the European margin progression?","Chris Hood - Kellogg Co.","No, I mean, I think we've already said it. I think we've made great progress, 400 basis points over the last four years, another 350 or so over the next few years. And we're essentially following the same playbook that the rest of the company is following around ZBB and RGM as well as some Project K initiatives. So we've got good visibility and we expect to make strong progress.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Good morning, Mario.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I wanted to ask about the Morningstar Farms business. So I know that you talked about some challenges there in terms of losing distribution. Can you comment a little bit more specifically on what's driving that? Is it that retailers aren't responding to the new packaging or is it just the new packaging isn't available, so they're essentially not taking orders at this time? And then, maybe from a longer-term perspective, this is a pretty on-trend category. Are you expecting a fairly quick return to growth once the packaging situation is resolved? Thank you.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Hey, Mario. It's Paul here. Yes, let me break this down. We're actually disappointed with the transformation of Morningstar Farms, not from a consumer point of view. We have consumer-validated and qualified packaging that we feel very good about. With any disruptive innovation, sometimes things can get disruptive, and we have not executed through to the shelf at the pace we expected to be able to execute. So I do think this is a case of execution, unfortunately, in the Morningstar Farms business.","If I looked across our business, I look at cereal, I look at snacks, we've seen some very good execution. Kashi would be one area, or Morningstar Farms, where I think we have opportunity to improve. The good news is, like I say, our packaging is consumer-validated.","We are now in a place where our distribution is back to normal and where it needs to be. I have visibility to a great pipeline of news coming early in the year. And we are now completely focused on communication and regenerating trial. There's no issue with the food. There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just missed it here. And now, we're focused very much on getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward.","We did lose one item, which shows through in the numbers, unfortunately negatively, is we did lose a big item in the club channel, one of our best sellers and we're working hard to get that item back in a new organic format. When we get that item back, the club business is big for this business. So we're cautiously optimistic that's coming back as well, and that will be a driver of growth for this business next year.","John Renwick - Kellogg Co.","Operator, I'm afraid we're out of time.

Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter 2018 results. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Fareed Khan, our Chief Financial Officer.","Slide number 2 shows our usual forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, profit margins, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand-building, up-front costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements.

A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, November 8. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, unless otherwise noted.","And I'll now turn it over to Steve and slide number 3.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another quarter of good progress under Deploy For Growth. We said we would increase our investment in brands and capabilities, and we did. We continued to improve consumption trends worldwide across most of our categories in the United States and in other developed markets around the world. We sustained our accelerated organic growth rate in our emerging markets. And we continued to expand distribution and consumption for single-serve pack formats, which are outpacing our categories.","Now, I recognize that the first thing many of you will notice about our third quarter results is that our operating profit came in short of our guidance. This was due to choices we made during the quarter to invest in our budding momentum. We again increased brand-building investment and we again leaned into single-serve items, even though they generated higher costs. Most of the shortfall from these factors was in a single business unit, which is U.S. Snacks, but these did not reflect any deterioration in our fundamentals in that business unit or elsewhere.","As the quarter progressed, we elected not to offset these investments and costs just to deliver a targeted operating profit. For instance, we could have lifted our foot off the gas pedal on our expansion of single-serve on-the-go items, many of which are co-packed and require additional transportation in a high freight cost environment, but we chose not to, instead leaning into these pack formats that are meeting key consumer occasions and incremental to our brand's growth. Again, this principally took place in our U.S. Snacks business where on-the-go is a critical occasion for us to win.","Similarly, at any time, we could have pulled back on brand-building investment, but we chose not to, instead increasing brand-building at a strong, high single-digit rate year-over-year because that is what is getting our brands back on firmer growth footing. A great example is RX, where we moved ahead with its first-ever national advertising campaign, even before realizing its full distribution expansion and on top of rolling out a new nut butters platform and a relaunched kids' line.","What's important is that these investments are working. You can see this in the improvement in our consumption and net sales growth this year. We generated organic growth, despite the remaining mechanical impact of our DSD exit and despite notably tougher second half comparisons. Improved consumption growth brings improved net sales growth, and we're seeing both. We also really like what we see going on in our portfolio, which we're shaping through investment decisions, SKU rationalization and M&A.","The Q3 benefits of these portfolio improvements are summarized on slide number 4, and will be described in more detail in the coming slides. Our consumption trends are improving around the world, including in the United States. And many of our biggest brands grew share in the quarter, as did many of our smaller challenger brands. Post-DSD U.S. Snacks is now stronger, thanks to a rationalized SKU lineup, increased brand investment and a deliberate expansion of on-the-go offerings. And in Q3, it continued to improve its velocities overall and gain share in key supported brands. Frozen Foods is sustaining its solid momentum. Our cereal business in core international developed markets have stabilized, and we showed signs of improvement in our U.S. cereal business in Q3.","Also in Q3, we sustained an accelerated growth rate in our expanding emerging markets. This acceleration comes not only from adding West Africa to our consolidated results this year \u2013 and that business continues to grow rapidly, by the way \u2013 but also from accelerating our organic growth rate across our emerging markets, sustaining a high single-digit growth rate that is meaningfully higher than in recent years. This emerging markets growth is contributing to, but not solely responsible for, good growth in net sales and operating profit across all three of our international regions. So these are the elements to listen for as we get into the details of the quarter.","And we'll start with Fareed taking you through the specifics of our Q3 and year-to-date financials.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Tough comps and increased investment may have restrained profit and earnings growth, but it was another quarter of net sales growth, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions and of improving consumption and sales trends. Our net sales obviously got a lift from our RX acquisition and recent consolidation of Multipro, our West Africa business, both of which continued to grow strongly in Q3. We also realized organic growth, even after the remaining negative and mechanical impact of the DSD exit.","Our operating profit was down modestly, reflecting the unusually strong double-digit growth in the year-earlier quarter, as well as incremental brand-building in this year's Q3 and costs related to our support of our expansion of single-serve pack formats. And EPS growth was aided by U.S. tax reform, net of headwinds like: higher interest expense, related to funding acquisitions; lower pension income, related to our decision to reduce our expected rate of return on plant assets; and lower equity earnings, partly related to shifts in our joint venture stakes earlier this year.","I should note that we also continue to deliver on cash flow. Excluding the voluntary pension contribution we made in Q2, our year-to-date cash flow remains above last year's before the subsequent accounting reclassification.","So let's examine the results in a little bit more detail. Slide 6 walks you through components of our net sales growth in the quarter and first nine months. Excluding currency, our net sales grew more than 9% year-on-year. Two acquisitions contributed almost 9 points of growth. These were: Multipro, which we consolidated in May; and RX, which we acquired in October of last year. Both these businesses continued to show strong sales at double-digit growth rates.","On an organic basis, our sales were up by nearly half a percentage point year-on-year, and we remain up slightly for the first nine months. Because we've lapped last year's DSD exit about midway through the quarter, its negative impact from SKU rationalization and elimination of the price premium we used to charge for DSD was only about half a percentage point in Q3. Excluding this DSD impact, our organic growth remained solid, but you'll notice that it was modestly slower than our first half growth. This is because, as we've pointed out previously, we face significantly tougher comps in the second half than in the first half as we lap last year's second half accelerations in Frozen Foods, European Pringles and ex-DSD U.S. Snacks, not to mention last year's Q3 hurricane benefit. But when you wrap it all together, our Q3 offered yet further evidence that our stepped-up brand investment is gaining traction, and we're getting back into sustainable top-line growth.","Let's turn to our profit margins, starting with gross margin on slide 7. We'll break down our gross profit margin decline into three buckets, just as we did last quarter, because we think it's helpful for understanding the various puts and takes. I'll start with the last bucket on the side, which is our ongoing input costs, net of productivity. Once again, our productivity and Project K savings were able to offset the margin impact of higher transportation, packaging and other costs. Cost inflation is sustaining at higher levels than we had anticipated. And we recently executed some initial Revenue Growth Management actions in several countries to help cover it as we go into 2019. But so far, we've managed this well.","The biggest impact in the quarter came again from the bucket that represents the mechanical impacts we've discussed previously. The impact of our DSD exit was much smaller in Q3 than it has been in recent quarters as we lap the year-ago exit during the quarter. So that's now behind us in Q4.","The other mechanical impact, the consolidation of Multipro, became a larger headwind in Q3, solely because it was in our results for a full quarter. That headwind remains with us through April of next year.","The bucket we call growth-related had a bigger impact than we had expected, albeit with similar drivers to what we experienced in Q2. These were principally two mix shifts that had the effect of pulling down our gross margin percentage. First, we had another strong quarter of growth in emerging markets businesses, which don't yet have the scale of developed markets and, therefore, carry lower percent margins. This growth is not cannibalizing any of our other businesses. As we grow our scale and shift our mix towards more value-added products, we will improve emerging markets margins.","The second notable shift was toward single-serve and on-the-go pack formats, which are depicted on slide 8. Deploy For Growth emphasis on winning occasions has us innovating new pack formats, particularly in the area of single-serve and on-the-go. In developed markets, this includes immediate consumption offerings and multi-packs. In emerging markets, this includes single-serve sachets with more affordable price points. Both are important opportunities for future growth.","Leaning into occasions, we developed and expanded these pack formats across the breadth of our portfolio for various channels, particularly in our U.S. Snacks business, where on-the-go is now running at more than 10% of sales. The good news is that demand is strong. You can see it in the scanner data, where our on-the-go offerings are growing rapidly, and the growth has accelerated faster than we had anticipated. We'll show you some figures on this in a moment. However, where these new pack formats are new for us, and where we were capacity-constrained on existing pack formats, we have relied on co-packers. Obviously, co-packing costs money, as does the related movement of product, particularly in a high freight cost environment. So while we like the incremental growth these pack formats bring us, they do represent a cost and margin headwind for us in the near-term.","We do have plans in place to address this for the medium-term. As I mentioned last quarter, we are investing in in-house packing capabilities for some of these pack formats, which will reduce manufacturing costs and transportation needs, but this will take a few quarters to get fully ramped up.","Getting back to the total company's results, we are not overly concerned about decreases in our percent margins. We know what's driving it, and we have plans to offset it. And we know these mix shifts are driving net sales dollars today, and are incremental to operating profits over time.","Our operating profit margin performance is shown on slide 9. Operating profit margin decreased year-on-year in Q3, reflecting the mechanical and growth-related impacts on gross margin, as well as nearly double-digit increases in brand-building year-on-year. In fact, in dollars, this year-on- year increase in brand-building was significantly greater than our year-on-year decline in operating profit.","Recall that we're comparing against our biggest operating profit and operating profit growth of (12:44) the quarter last year, when we were exiting DSD overhead, but had not yet fully ramped up brand-building. You'll also recall that we made the decision several months ago to add even more brand-building than originally planned to Q3, because it was working and because we had strong ideas to invest behind.","A large portion of this increased brand-building was behind key U.S. Snacks brands and RX, and the impact on consumption has already been positive. We're willing to make that trade-off between near-term profit and reinvestment for top-line growth that's sustainable. And it's already having a positive impact on our top-line performance. So Q3 was another quarter of investment and improving top-line performance.","So now let's turn to our full year guidance, as shown on slide 10. We're moving our guidance for currency-neutral net sales growth to the high-end of our previous guidance, or roughly 5%. This reflects our year-to-date improvement and also reflects our consumption trends' continued improvements across the portfolio, as our brands respond to increased investment and improved execution. If anything, we think we can do better than this, but we're leaving the possibility for trade inventory reductions in Q4 in a couple of post-DSD Snacks categories. Nonetheless, we obviously feel good about the top line.","We're bringing down our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth. Some of this reflects Q3 results, but also reflects similar dynamics anticipated for Q4. We're putting more investment dollars to work in certain businesses and capabilities. And we've decided to continue to expand single-serve, even in a high freight cost environment.","Again, as Steve mentioned, we could pull back in these areas in order to preserve operating profit, but that would go against what we're trying to do: build momentum for our brands and develop capabilities that will help us sustain sales and profit growth well into the future. This reduction in OP guidance brings our currency-adjusted EPS growth back down to about 7% to 8%. We still expect interest expense to be up year-on-year on borrowing related to acquisitions made over the last 12 months, and other income to be down due to our reduced expected return on assets assumptions in our pension and post-retirement plans. However, recent tax benefits should enable us to finish the year with effective tax rates at the low end of the 18% to 19% range we've been guiding to. We're not making any changes to our cash flow guidance, despite the lower operating profit.","So in summary, our financials reflect that we're doing what we said we'd do, leaning into investments, both in brand-building and capabilities. We're seeing the positive impact on top-line growth. And we're choosing to continue to lean into these investments, even if it means less profit for Q4 than previously planned. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve to walk you through our businesses.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Fareed. We'll start with North America, which is summarized on slide number 11. We remain on track for a markedly improved organic net sales performance this year, with and without the mechanical impact of last year's DSD exit. That DSD exit impact was nearly a percentage point of headwind to North America's sales growth in Q3 and close to 3 percentage points year-to-date.","As you read left to right, you see a market improvement in Morning Foods; still work to be done, but much improved, especially in Q3. You see that United States Snacks has picked up its growth, excluding the DSD impact. Specialty Channels is lapping some unusual factors from 2017, like FEMA orders during last year's hurricanes. North America Other has sustained a dramatic improvement in organic growth, and that doesn't even include RX as of yet. So Kellogg North America is clearly improving its performance this year.","Of course, the better indicator of the improving health of our business is consumption. Slide number 12 aggregates our nine largest categories in the U.S. and compares our consumption growth to that of our categories. What it indicates is that we have improved our consumption trends in the U.S., particularly coming out of our DSD transition in mid-2017. Across our portfolio and business units, not only has our increased investment in brand-building and on-the-go pack formats helped our categories, but our execution has helped us to stabilize our share.","This chart only shows our biggest categories in the U.S., but the same share recovery story is true in Canada and in key measured markets around the world. This is why we feel so strongly about continuing to lean into these investments, because they are working.","Slide number 13 summarizes U.S. Snacks. Because we exited from DSD at most of our customers by the end of July last year, this is the last quarter of year-on-year mechanical impact from DSD on net sales. And it came in at roughly negative 240 basis points to U.S. Snacks net sales. Excluding that impact from both years, our comparisons in Q3 were the toughest of the year.","Beyond shipment timing, however, consumption data showed continued improvement. Led by our Cheez-It and Club brands, our crackers consumption growth accelerated, resulting in a solid share gain in the quarter. Pringles also accelerated its growth, continuing to gain share in salty snacks. In wholesome snacks, Rice Krispies Treats continues to gain share, even with supply constraints. And in cookies, resumed investment support behind Keebler Fudge Shoppe, Keebler Grahams, Mother's, and Famous Amos is bringing these key brands back into consumption and share growth, stabilizing our share overall. Across our snacks categories, we like what we're seeing in base sales and velocities, not to mention restored display activity.","Importantly, especially for these snacking categories, our on-the-go offerings grew consumption at just about a double-digit rate in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, many of these pack formats are co-packed, either because we don't currently have the packaging capabilities for those particular formats or simply because demand is outstripping our supply. This cut into U.S. Snacks year-on-year operating profit growth in Q3 and will do so again in Q4. But we're investing for long-term growth, and building demand and scale for on-the-go is a strategic priority for us. We're also not waiting to find solutions to offset and reduce these costs. For instance, we're investing now in in-house packing capacity, which will come online during 2019.","So we feel good about the direction we're heading in U.S. Snacks. Fareed mentioned the possibility of trade inventory reduction in Q4, which is a precautionary stance, but we're very pleased with our in-market performance and expect that to continue. And while we're leaning into investment in brands and on-the-go pack formats, this is the right thing for the long-term growth of this business.","Now let's turn to U.S. Morning Foods and slide number 14. Morning Foods' net sales declined by less than forecast in Q3, continuing a trend of moderating declines.","In cereal, our consumption in share was pulled down by the temporary absence on shelf of Honey Smacks, which accounted for 40 basis points of our overall 20 basis point decline. Remember, this brand had been manufactured by a third-party until June. And while we were transitioning it back to in-house production, we did not have Honey Smacks on shelf during the third quarter. In Q4, in-house production has commenced and the brand is returning to shelves, as we speak.","But behind this Honey Smacks impact is good improving in-market performance. Our Core 6 brands collectively gained share in the quarter. In the taste fun segment, both Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops grew consumption and share.","But more important for the category will be stabilizing the wellness-oriented adult segment. Stabilizing adult brands Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats was a priority for us this year. And our efforts to amplify the wellness attributes of these brands are clearly resonating with consumers. Both brands posted growth in consumption and share this quarter.","Meantime, in toaster pastries, Pop-Tarts returned to consumption growth on the strength of food news such as new Pop-Tarts Splitz and Gone Nutty!. This is what drives this important brand, and we have good plans ahead for it.","So getting back to our playbook is yielding improved results in Morning Foods. It's requiring increased investment, but this is important as we work toward stabilizing this business. As I've said before, there's still more to do and across more of our brands, but recent consumption trends show that we're making progress.","Turning to slide number 15 and U.S. Specialty Channels, U.S. Specialty Channels posted an unusual net sales decline in Q3. The business lapped year-ago FEMA shipments related to hurricanes and we experienced trade inventory reduction in convenience stores and vending early in the quarter. But, frankly, this was less of a net sales decline than we had expected, as we continued to see good execution and promising innovation across these channels.","Indeed, we've had success testing new innovations in Specialty Channels before expanding their launches into other retail channels. We'll have another quarter of lapping FEMA shipments in Q4, but we feel good about our underlying fundamentals in this business.","As we have told you on previous earnings calls, Specialty Channels operating profit in 2018 is forecast to be down year-on-year, due to changes we made this year in the allocation of costs from other U.S. segments. This is not related to any change in the underlying business, which remains solid.","Let's turn to slide number 16 and our North America Other segment. RX obviously contributed much of this segment's year-on-year growth. This business continues to expand, with triple-digit consumption growth and ACV distribution now exceeding 70%, up from less than 30% a year ago. During the quarter, we launched our first-ever national advertising campaign aimed at increasing this brand's awareness, while also relaunching kids' flavored bars and launching new nut butters.","Even excluding RX, North America Other's organic growth was about 3% in Q3, another strong performance led by U.S. Frozen Foods. Eggo's consumption and share growth continue to be strong, even as we lap last year's mid-year acceleration, on a strong core and the success of our relaunched Thick & Fluffy line.","MorningStar Farms consumption slowed in the quarter, as the brand and the overall category lapped last year's market acceleration, but it continues to have favorable consumer trends and a strong pipeline of innovation and marketing ahead.","Canada's net sales increased year-on-year. We held share in cereal and snacks, led by effective innovation around wellness offerings like Vector and Kashi, and we grew share in Eggo. Kashi's net sales declined slightly in the quarter, but by much less than was forecast and by much less than last year. Our cereal consumption continued to grow as the Kashi brand cereal accelerated its growth, led by GOLEAN and the launch of Kashi by Kids.","Meanwhile, Bear Naked continued to add to its leading share in granola. A key for the overall Kashi business will be stabilizing snack bars, and that work is well underway, including innovation and expanded distribution for our Pure Organic brand. So these businesses are all pointed in the right direction as well.","Now, let's talk about our international regions, starting with slide number","17. This slide shows what a difference a year makes, with accelerated organic growth in 2018 across all three regions. And remember, this doesn't even include Multipro, our fast-growing business in West Africa, which is accounted for as an acquisition.","As we build up our scale and portfolios in emerging markets, these regions become that much more important to our growth algorithm. And in Q3, we continued to see a combination of elevated organic net sales growth in emerging markets, snacks growth and stabilized cereal performance in developed markets. Let's take each in turn.","We'll start with Europe on slide number 18. Because of last year's first half promotional disruption on Pringles, net sales growth comparisons in the second half of 2018 are markedly more challenging than they were in the first half, and yet we continued to post growth in this region. Pringles sustained its momentum with double-digit consumption growth in Europe, led by share gains in big markets like the UK and France. Cereal sales were off slightly year-on-year, principally on category softness in the UK and France. However, our consumption declines moderated in the quarter as another share gain in the UK and a stabilization of share in France gave us a higher overall share across Europe for the quarter.","Once again, emerging markets were a driver of the Europe region's net sales growth for both cereal and snacks. This was led by Russia, Egypt and the Middle East, so another solid performance for our Europe region. Markets remain challenging, particularly in Continental Europe, and we do continue to face tougher comps in the second half on Pringles. But Kellogg Europe continues to deliver growth anyway.","Let's turn to Latin America on slide number 19. Already strong in the first half, Kellogg Latin America's net sales growth accelerated further in Q3. This strong performance was again driven: by Mexico, where our cereal consumption and share growth remained impressive; and in Mercosur, where Parati sustained its growth momentum and biscuit share gains in Brazil. Meanwhile, Pringles continued to grow in key markets across the region. And our Caribbean\/Central America subregion continues to rebound. So in a region that is no stranger to volatility in currencies and politics, we continue to see the benefits of well-established brands, an experienced management team, and a portfolio that has been shaped toward snacking.","And finally, let's take a look at our Asia Pacific region shown on slide number 20. Our net sales growth was boosted by a full quarter of consolidating Multipro. Recall that this is the distributor portion of our partnership in West Africa, in which we acquired a consolidating stake in early May. Treated in our results like an acquisition, this business also continued to post strong double-digit growth of its own in Q3. We'll talk more about this exciting business and the competitive advantage that Multipro gives us in West Africa at our Day@K investor event in a couple of weeks.","But Asia Pacific also grew strongly on an organic basis, which excludes Multipro. We've increased cereal consumption in emerging markets, led by India and Southeast Asia, as well as South Africa. Impressively, we also grew cereal in developed market Australia, where the category has returned to growth and we've continued to gain share. Pringles sales momentum continues, with growth in Q3 led by double-digit gains in India and South Africa, along with sustained growth in Australia, Japan and Taiwan, so very strong fundamentals for us in Asia Pacific. We're proving that we can stabilize and grow in a developed market like Australia, and we continue to expand in promising long-term growth markets like India and Africa.","So allow me to summarize with slide number 21. We feel very good about the direction we're heading. Our portfolio is being shaped toward growth. We made some very good acquisitions in recent years, and we've successfully integrated them. Some fill in white spaces in developed markets. Others have boosted our presence and scale in fast-growing emerging markets.","We've also shaped our portfolio through investment. Could we have pulled back on some investment in Q3 and delivered more profit? Yes, of course. But we're leaning into investment right now, both behind our brands and behind honing our capabilities. And I really don't want to slow that down, because these investments are the essence of Deploy For Growth and they're already gaining traction. Look at our improved net sales performance. Witness our improved consumption and share performance, and see how broad-based these improvements are across our portfolio and geographies. Behind this is better, higher ROI brand investment, enhanced capabilities and increased competitiveness.","So, we're willing to deliver a little less operating profit in the near-term because we have investment ideas with strong ROIs that can solidify our path to sustainable long-term top-line growth, and we feel very good about that. And it's not just investments that will help improve our trajectory. We've made some big, bold moves in recent years, and it has changed our cost structure, our portfolio, and our operating approach.","We'll talk more about these at our Day@K investor event in a couple of weeks. These are exciting times for Kellogg Company. And I hope you are as excited about our future as we are. As always, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees who are creating this future for us.","And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, just had a question for you in relation to the gross margin, a couple data points you gave throughout the presentation and discussion, but you had input costs were offset by productivity savings, if I heard correctly. You had obviously some higher inflation, but productivity offset that. You had the DSD and Multipro effect. And the end result was kind of the underlying gross margin being down 70 basis points. What I'm trying to get to is basically the mix effect on those co-packing costs. I know you talked a lot about those, but is that the totality of the decline in the gross margin? And then, when do you think you can bring these co-packing products into your own manufacturing facility to reduce that cost?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yes, Chris, it's Fareed. I think you got the buckets right. Really year-to-date, we've been offsetting pretty high input cost inflation through productivity. And that's the ongoing work that we do, day-in, day-out, as well as benefits from Project K that continue to come through. And that was true again in Q3.","Where we've seen the most inflation has been around the transportation area, and that's an important factor when we get into the single-serve dynamics that we've talked about. So on single-serve, basically we're seeing a lot of growth in those categories. We like that growth. Long-term, it offers terrific potential. It's already a sizable part of our snacks business, so think about 10% of sales. And even with that percentage, we feel we are under-indexed to where that business could be. And so we like the growth opportunities. We are pursuing it. A lot of our product innovation is in that space.","Now, the co-pack challenges really are solved through investments in the supply-chain, many of which are in place. They just don't happen overnight. So we could see some of these pressures continuing through the first half of next year, as we get co-packing centers put in place, as we have more streamlined back-ends to some of our production lines, and we have the capacity to meet the demand growth that we have in place. Very solvable, it just doesn't happen overnight. And, we're on that, both with investments and with organizational focus. What we didn't want to do is do anything to get in the way of that growth because, that's where the consumers' going, and very important for our brands to tap into those opportunities.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just to be clear, then, you would quantify that gross margin challenge in the quarter and some of the overall profit challenges is mix and co-packing. And those are somewhat one and the same, but also there's a mix factor in there as well. Is that right?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","They're connected, because it's the customers, it's the way those products get to customers, but the biggest single factor is just the format and the complexity of either single-serve items or mixed items that again go to the same sort of consumer dynamics, but that's right.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Fareed, just wanted to come back to the North American businesses. Price increases seem to be a theme across the space, especially now from your largest competitor in snacks, but your strategy seems geared more towards pack size and mix at this point, so can you speak a bit more to your opportunities to take pricing as well? I mean you touched on the NRM (34:11) activities in your comments, but just more broadly about U.S. limiting factors online pricing here? Thank you.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yes, John. Thanks for the question. This is Steve. We do see an opportunity broad-based for Revenue Growth Management, so not just pricing, but the other things that you mentioned. We've already taken several RGM actions in 2018 in the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We've announced others, including in the United States, but they won't be effective until later in Q4.","Obviously, we don't discuss any prospective 2019 pricing actions, but you've heard me and all of us talk in the past about earning price in the marketplace. We continue to really drive that mentality. We're coming with more innovations next year, which we think are very exciting, which will come with the ability to earn more price in the marketplace. So it's broad-based Revenue Growth Management, but it's very, very important to us moving forward into 2019 because we are seeing, as everybody is seeing, a more inflationary environment out there.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And I guess is it your perspective the consumer can handle the higher mix or the higher prices overall going forward?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yes, it is. And particularly if you're delivering more value, right? And so we've given examples in the past where we've improved food. We've innovated around food, around packaging, around formats. And if you get the consumer value equation right, then you can definitely earn the price from the consumer, which is what the retailer's looking for, right? You want to moderate your elasticities as much as possible and we do see that opportunity.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. So I just wanted to understand the fourth quarter implications and what's happened. I think that the guidance changes will result in like a 20% reduction in the consensus EPS forecast. So the changes here, Steve, seem to be quite substantial.","Could you just explain a little bit in the evolution of why is this such a big change? Certainly, it's been the strategy to do these single-serves for a long time now, so I don't perceive that the growth in single-serve was shocking to the Kellogg Company, but I feel like you guys really had a big change of understanding your cost structure of what those products mean. But I'd just kind of like to understand why that changed so much.","And then just to build on that, in the Q1 and Q2 of next year, I think, Fareed, you said that it's a similar magnitude event of what those impacts would be, but could you just confirm that? Thank you.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. I'll start and Fareed will go deeper. I'd say if you look at the broad implications of our results and our guidance, in your parlance, I'd say we chose a high-quality miss versus a low-quality make. We could have cut back, but the hardest thing to do in consumer packaged goods today is create demand and drive growth. And key to our Deploy For Growth strategy is returning to top-line growth. And it's happening, and we're pleased with it. And we're going to continue to work on the margin, without a doubt.","If there's a mea culpa, the single-serve demand creation happened faster than we anticipated, and a good bit faster than we anticipated, at the same time that the supply-chain costs and the costs of shipping multiple products all around multiple networks accelerated at the same time. So it was little bit of a perfect storm of better demand creation, which we like. That's a good problem to solve and much higher logistics costs than were anticipated.","And rather than cut back in areas like brand-building to manage towards a different outcome, we like the fact that we'll return to top-line growth and are willing to invest against it. You want to -","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Sure. David, a couple of points around Q4 and then we really don't want to get into 2019 guidance on this particular call, but I'll give you some factors. First of all, the underlying fundamentals that we talked about on the brands on consumption around top-line, we think are solid and we expect those to continue into Q4. We pointed a little bit of risk in the sense of potential trade inventory reductions.","We'll see how that plays out, but you have a couple of factors that played out in Q3 that will continue into Q4. The first of those is our Deploy For Growth investments to really accelerate the top-line. And, as Steve mentioned, that's a choice. Those investments, even in brand-building alone, were greater than the OP decline in the quarter, right, so continue to be fairly significant.","Some of those are around our core brands, some innovation that's coming down the pipeline. We've got some pretty exciting new RX platforms that we're leaning into. Globally, high-frequency occasions, on-the-go themes are also important, as well some capabilities. Those investments are working and we don't want to take our foot off the gas.","The second factor is the single-serve dynamics that we've talked quite a bit about. And, as I mentioned, those don't get fixed overnight. But over time, as we optimize and streamline some of the supply chain co-pack areas, those margins will come up. That's probably more of a second half of next year phenomenon. So if you take those together, that's sort of about two-thirds to three-quarters of the pressure.","Now in Q4, we do expect continued inflationary pressures in transportation. From where we saw it at the beginning of the year, it's actually more significant than we expected. We have RGM initiatives on that, as well as other cost pressures. But in Q4, you've got sort of a timing balance between those two that are going to play out. And also, we're starting to see some hedging in some of the procurement commodity areas rolling off. And that creates some pressure.","And the last thing I'll mention is that we did a nice job really all year around controllable costs. So we're spending in brand. But if you look at our ZBB program, if you look at our overhead productivity, all the cost savings that we expected from the DSD exit are flowing through, and so we like that. So Q3 also benefits from some pretty solid cost actions. And while we'll continue to see some benefits, we don't see sort of the same rate of offset coming in. So you put all that together, that says Q4 is going to be a little bit more challenging than where Q3 came out. And that really sort of shapes our guidance.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for the comments.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. I don't think I heard you guys talk about updated gross margins for the year. Obviously, it won't be at quite as good as you thought previously. But could you give us some idea of where you expect them to come in for the entire year?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. What I'll say is the dynamics that we talked about for the quarter will continue to play out. So the mix effect will be rolling off in Q4, the mix impact from the DSD exit. But the Multipro dynamics will still stay with us. The mechanical impacts will sort of be about 150 basis points. And then on the single-serve issues, those we expect to continue. And that's sort of the primary two dynamics. And so we put that in the category of kind of mix, which when sort of sized, is maybe 100 basis points on top of that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, follow-up for me, you had called out a substantial increase in marketing in your North America Other segment. And you called out the first national ad campaign for RXBAR, but, at least the numbers that we saw, RXBAR sales weren't any higher this quarter than last quarter. Is this just because it takes time for ad campaigns to work? I know sometimes there is a lag effect. And if so, when should we start expecting RX sales in this segment to really start ramping up?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Well, we're actually very happy with RX sales. They continue at a torrid pace. And so, the whole idea behind the national advertising campaign was when you go from circa 30% ACV distribution to 70% ACV distribution, you want to keep the demand as strong as possible, because typically what happens is your sales per point of distribution will go down because you're expanding that ACV so dramatically. And we didn't see that. So the customer support we're getting is very strong. The brand health scores that we're seeing are very strong. Unaided brand awareness is growing very, very nicely. Brand loyalty is growing very nicely. So we really like what we see with RXBAR. The customers like the support, based on the incredible increase in ACV distribution we're getting. So there's typically a lag, as you point out, when you're building brand awareness and you're building equity. But we really like what we see in RX.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Good morning, Alexia.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. You've mentioned the trade inventory reductions a couple of times that I think are going to hit in Q4. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what those products are and why those inventories are being reduced? And then, just a quick follow-up, how much was advertising spending up year-on-year this quarter? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Alexia, for the question. I'll start, and Fareed may want to go deeper. In terms of inventory, when we exited DSD, obviously, it was a major transition that we've been talking about for some time now, where the inventory went from our system into the customers' warehouse system. And over time, we expected that they would have a higher level of inventory as they got used to, obviously, carrying a whole new line of goods, and that would be optimized over time, which you would expect.","So we've been expecting inventory to come down, and it has not come down. So we're not calling that it will come down in Q4, but it may because we're just expecting that retailers, like us, would look for optimal levels of inventory. So we're not saying that it will happen, but just to be precautionary, we're pointing out that it is possible at some point in time. And it's U.S. Snacks that we're talking about.","In terms of brand-building, we're not going to get into the details, but I can tell you it's up high single digits. And so that's why I say you see other companies would pull back if profit's under pressure. We like the growth that we're driving. We like the demand creation that's happening. And so, if anything, we've leaned into brand-building this year in a high single-digit way. I don't know, Fareed...","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","And Alexia, the only thing I'll add is that brand-building in dollar terms was greater that our OP decline on dollar terms, so pretty significant in the quarter. But it's working, and we see that in the brands. And we're being very focused about where that investment goes. We like the ROIs, which is why we continue to focus on that area.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I just had a question on non-U.S. business. Given currency headwinds you're experiencing and it would seem like expect to continue to experience through, kind of, early next year, first half of next year, can you just, kind of, briefly explain a bit, kind of, the way you're thinking about pricing in non-U.S. markets? Because, I mean, as of now, right, we're not really seeing the pricing. Therefore, it's not offsetting the currency. But from others, we're seeing it. So I'm just curious if there's a disconnect between how you're thinking about pricing relative to currency versus others or if you think this is more of a short-term effect in Q3 and likely as we get into Q4 next year, you would look to potentially take some pricing in non-U.S. markets. Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rob. So we look at, first, from a high-level perspective, pricing at a consumer level, right? So we have to be competitive in the marketplace. We have to earn the right price in the marketplace, and we have to sell the consumer. So we can't look just at currency and say, currency moves, therefore the consumer is going to pay more. Because if you're sitting in a country, obviously, you're thinking about consumer goods in your own currency. Now, having said that, we look at RGM opportunities everywhere around the globe, and we've seen good opportunities to do that.","We're not big in some of the hyperinflation economies that some are talking about at all right now. So we think currency is very manageable. We think there's RGM opportunities. I mentioned some of them in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, that we've already taken in 2018, and we'll continue to look for opportunities going forward, but, again, with the consumer at the heart and soul of our planning process.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. So I noted the total expense in Morning Foods, and that's maybe there's a lot in there, but it's just sales less operating profit, as you disclose it, was up for the first time since the segment peaked six years ago, year-over-year. When I look back, you've taken out about $200 million expenses from that segment, even as recently as 2015, about $80 million. So I guess maybe a question and a half in here. Some of that has to be discretionary investment. So what gives you the confidence that you're spending enough on the right things right now? And is this sort of a bottom? Should we expect continued investment and lower margin in that segment, I guess, as you reported that big profit pool at North America going forward? Thanks so much.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jon. I'll start, and, again, Fareed can go to deeper. Morning Foods, we've said, U.S. Morning Foods, that we want to stabilize, and that it won't be a growth engine, doesn't need to be a growth engine for the company. But we want to stabilize the business, and we know we've got great brands. And we are investing double-digit in brand-building to make that happen. And we're liking what we see in a number of the big brands in our Core 6 in terms of now stabilizing and growing share and again cutting the decline fairly dramatically from where it was. And so we are investing in capabilities as well. It's a very important business for us and we like what we're seeing early days in terms of our goal towards stabilization. You want to add?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","So what I'd add is that in Morning Foods, which is true of all of our businesses, the investments back in the business, one, discretionary, and, two, in a very focused way around supporting big brands that are responding well, building capabilities, and also innovation. And we've got a couple of interesting platforms coming out in Morning Foods around the gut health space. An we think that's kind of a very interesting area where the cereal category and Kellogg, in particular, can have a lot to say around health and wellness, and the importance of the biome.","And so all these investments reflect pretty focused areas. We've done a lot of work around measuring how those are responding, are we getting the ROI. And the fact that we're continuing to make those investments basically says that those are positive, and we like what we're seeing in terms of top line.","All the discipline around cost and efficiencies are as much today as they were a few years ago. And, in many ways, that's fueling some of the investments we're putting back into the business, as I mentioned. The DSD savings are coming through. Ongoing productivity savings are coming through. And that's allowing us to offset, at least year-to-date, some of the inflationary pressures that we've been seeing. So the investment's across all the platforms in a targeted way, and the returns have been positive.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Fair enough, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Vivek Srivastava - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","Thank you. This is Vivek Srivastava speaking on behalf of Jason English. My question is on trade spend versus brand-building. So recently, a few of your peers have talked about shifting dollars from marketing to trade, while you have been stepping up brand-building aggressively. How are retailers responding to this? And do you expect the same strategy to go forward or probably put more in trade? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yes, thanks, for the question. We don't break out brand-building in terms of trade and above the line and so forth for competitive reasons. But brand-building for us is not trade. And when we say brand-building is up double digits, we mean things that are directly addressed at the consumer. So think TV, think digital, think advertising and promotion. So it is real investment against building brand equity with our consumers.","And I can tell you that our retailers are pleased with it because we are leaning in. And when you improve the velocity off their shelf, obviously it's a win-win. And so, that's what I talked about in Morning Foods, getting those brands stabilized and several of them back to growth. It's an incredibly important category with high household penetration, so they're pleased with that.","The Snack business going from DSD into the warehouse allowed us to substantially increase our brand-building, and you can see, and we talked about and pointed out, the velocity improvement and the SKU rationalization, so our shelf sets are so much more productive than they were. So again, retailer likes that. And the innovations that Fareed mentioned, that we're bringing require investment. And, again, retailers are very welcome to innovations in the categories in which we play.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Good morning. I have two questions, but a comment first. This is a quarter where you increased sales guidance, actually beat in terms of sales estimates for the third quarter in terms of organic growth. And we look at the scanner data and your trajectory is better, right? But then the stock is down 9%. And obviously, that's because of gross margins. I won't harp too much on brand-building because it's up high single digits in the third quarter, but it was up a lot more in the first half, you know double digits year-to-date. So brand-building is not why the stock is down 9% today.","So what I want to ask, the first question is very simple. You're not getting credit for the sales growth momentum because we don't know where margin is going to be next year, so can you give more color in terms of how we should think about EBIT margins for next year? Or at Investor Day on November 11 (sic) [November 13], are you going to be quite specific about 2019 guidance? That's the first question, and then I have a follow-up.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Okay. Pablo, I'll start. First of all, I don't know what the market is doing, but we don't manage the stock price on a day-to-day basis. We manage the long-term health and growth of this business, as if we were owners in it. And the most important thing that we can do for this business is return it to top-line growth in a responsible and sustainable way.","And so we're pleased with what's happening with our brand-building investments. And you can see another quarter of organic sales growth, which we haven't had for quite some number of years. And so we have problems that we need to solve clearly around how that demand is being supplied to the marketplace in terms of all the single-serve challenges that we've talked about. But the single hardest thing to do in consumer packaged goods, which I mentioned, is really return to top-line growth if you're actually in decline. And so that requires a level of investment.","And over the long-term, we will get back to our algorithm that we've talked and that we talked about a while back at CAGNY, which, again, is low single-digit top-line growth, mid-single-digit OP growth. And, ultimately, that leads to double-digit total shareholder return growth. And then the stock price will take care of itself. And so that's our commitment. That's our strategy.","In terms of 2019 guidance, we'll give some more directional, where we're heading at our Day@K, but what we can tell you is we like what we're seeing in terms of the brand-building investment. We like that we're returning to top-line growth. We've got a lot of brands that are responding quite well.","Fareed mentioned the headwinds in some detail that we faced and that we're facing down. That's not going to change dramatically going into 2019, the shape of 2019. Just because you turn the calendar page and it's January and not December doesn't immediately fix things. So the shape may resemble 2018, but the fact that we're getting back to top-line growth, ultimately, is very, very important.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Agreed. And just a quick follow-up for Fareed, you said that on-the-go snacks was 10% of sales. Was that of total sales, because that would mean 40% of snacks, if you can clarify that? And my question really is more once these co-packing issues are solved and you take care of supply chain issues, let's say, by middle of next year, on a more normalized basis, would on-the-go snacks be more profitable than your packaged snacks in a normalized basis? Thanks.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yes, sure. On the first question, we didn't give sort of an overall percentage, so that 10% was 10% of the U.S. Snacks business. Now, we have on-the-go formats and on-the-go SKUs across all of our businesses all over the world. And so, we haven't given the total percentage points. But it's the U.S. Snacks business where these co-pack pressures are.","As so, that's still a very sizable business. So if you think about transportation costs, multiple shipping, handling by third parties and you can pretty quickly envision how contribution margin from a pretty sizable business would erode as that business grew. And that's really the pressure that we're seeing in that area. And could you just remind me the second part of your question? Sorry.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Once that normalizes, are on-the-go snacks more profitable compared to the rest of snacks?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Yeah. So you think about impulse purchases, convenience channels, there's no reason to believe that these things shouldn't be at least in parity with the rest of our margins. And again, one thing to also point out about the Snacks business, as we've talked about post-DSD, the Snacks' operating margins coming up to the North America average. All those DSD savings in terms of structural savings are still coming through. And so we've got this what I'd say is a medium-term challenge around co-pack single-serve. That will get addressed. But the fundamentals of the business over the, let's call it, latter part of next year should be right on track. We just got a little bit of delay as we work through this co-pack issue.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Understood, thank you.","John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.","Operator, I think we are out of time for any more questions. I will be around all day if anyone has any further follow-up questions.","Operator","This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations for Kellogg Company. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference call.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for a review of our full year and fourth quarter 2014 results. I'm joined here by John Bryant, Chairman and CEO; and Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer.","The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. And as you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, February 16. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","And I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable full year sales were at the lower end of our guidance range. Our results for full year comparable operating profit was slightly lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to the decline in sales. And our results for full year comparable earnings per share were in line with our expectations, but were also at the low end of the range.","Project K is on track and we've delivered savings in line with our guidance for 2014. The global business services initiative is going well and we've begun to reduce capacity in some regions and add capacity in others.","Results from our labor strategy intend to drive a more competitive, sustainable cost structure have been mixed. We've seen good results in Europe and Australia, although we still have work to do in the U.S. As you know, Project K will provide us with a considerable amount of financial flexibility and we are continuing our investment in 2015.","We're at an important point as we enter 2015. After a disappointing 2014, we are building a platform for growth over the coming year. We will continue to execute Project K. We are investing in our business and we expect to stabilize our top line in 2015. In providing guidance for 2015, we recognize the critical task of returning the company to sustainable top line growth. We expect full year comparable net sales to be approximately flat, a significant improvement from the trends we saw in 2014. We were pleased with our performance in much of the international business in 2014. And our expectations are that the positive sales trends will continue in 2015. However, we do have more work to do in the U.S., particularly in the cereal and snack businesses. Ron will provide more detail regarding our guidance for 2015 in a few minutes.","As we look to the long-term health of the business, it is critically important that we set realistic financial goals. Please turn to Slide 4 and a discussion of our long-term targets. We are changing our target for long-term comparable revenue growth to a low single-digit rate. Our target for comparable operating profit growth remains at a mid-single-digit rate and our target for currency-neutral comparable EPS growth remains at a high single-digit rate. One of the key drivers of success is targeting realistic goals, which can be achieved over the long-term.","The businesses in the developed categories in which we compete are expected to grow at a low single-digit rate over the long-term. And while our cereal and snack businesses in developing and emerging regions will grow faster, we think that low single-digit top line growth for the total business is a realistic and achievable goal.","And 2015 will be a step in the right direction. Results will improve from those we saw in previous periods and we will build a platform from which we can grow in the years to come.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 and a discussion regarding the areas of investment. As we've discussed with you over the last couple of quarters, our current investment as part of Project K will be centered on the 3 main areas over the past purchase: Desire, Decide, and Delight. First of all, we support our brands with great brand building ideas that generate the Desire for our products. The way in which we engage with consumers has continued to evolve and our investment takes various forms, including digital media, consumer promotions such as inserts and traditional advertising. As you know, we currently spend a high percentage of sales on brand building. And while we're increasing our investment in brand building, we are as focused on optimizing the impact of this investment as we are on increasing the amount of the investment.","Next is the Decide phase, where we bring it all to life in store. We're investing in sales capabilities. We have invested in both the cereal and snack sales forces in the U.S. and have always started [ph] to see better execution and results in store and have also started to invest in the 3 international regions, including investment in regional sales Centers of Excellence, designed to share best practices.","And finally is the Delight phase. We Delight consumers with great food. Consumer trends in health and wellness and in weight management are evolving. And we must appeal to those trends with foods that address the needs of consumers and that also taste great. We've been doing a lot of work on our foods around the world, including the recent launch of Mueslis and granolas and the reformulation of many of our existing foods. Specifically, we've launched new Special K bars with improved food and packaging. We have new Kashi cereals and we're converting the GOLEAN brand to be GMO-free the heart-to-heart brand to organic. And we're also promoting the versatility of our foods.","So to sum up. Much of this activity is intended to address the challenges that we faced in developed businesses around the world in the last year or so. I mean, some of these activity has started and it's early in the year, but we're starting to see a response and we're optimistic that it will provide a base for future sales growth.","And now I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of the financial results for the quarter and full year.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 shows the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable net sales for the full year decreased by 2%. We had better performance in some of our international businesses, particularly in the second half of the year. But we experienced declines in our developed cereal businesses and the U.S. Snacks business. We are executing initiatives in these businesses, including the introduction of new foods and investment in marketing, as John mentioned, to improve performance.","The recorded quarterly operating loss was $422 million, which included a significant non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of $822 million. This was primarily driven by the impact the changes in interest rates had on pension plan liabilities.","Comparable operating profit decreased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit declined by 3.9% for the full year, more than we expected as a result of lower production volume and higher distribution costs. Cost management actions and lower incentive compensation and overhead contributed positively to fourth quarter and full year performance. As John mentioned, investment in brand building is significant and overall brand building for the year remained unchanged as a percentage of sales in 2014.","Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments to 53rd week, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability, were $0.84 per share on the fourth quarter and $3.81 per share for the full year, in line with our expectations. These results include $0.02 of currency headwind in the fourth quarter and $0.01 for the full year. The 53rd week added $0.07 to earnings per share in the quarter.","Slide 7 shows the composition of the fourth quarter and full year sales growth. For the full year, reported sales decreased by 1.4% and comparable sales decreased by 2%, with a similar decline in comparable net sales in the fourth quarter. Comparable volume decreased by 2.6% for the full year and price mix increased by 0.6%.","Comparable volume stabilized in Europe and in Latin America in the fourth quarter. The decline in volume was primarily the result of the developed cereal and snack businesses in the U.S.","The impact of currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.8 points for the full year and nearly 3% in the fourth quarter as many currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar. The 53rd week also contributed growth in the quarter and for the full year.","Slide 8 shows our comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter and the year. Comparable gross margin decreased by 40 basis points for the full year and by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. And this decline was consistent with our latest guidance. Lower production volume driven by our sales performance and higher distribution costs impacted margin.","Our savings from productivity were in line with expectations and savings from Project K also met expectations.","Slide 9 shows the comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the fourth quarter. North America's comparable operating profit decreased by 7%, largely as a result of lower sales posted in the quarter.","We continue to face challenges in our U.S. cereal and snacks businesses. And this was the primary driver of the decline in operating profit in the quarter. In addition, we also saw lower production volume and greater-than-anticipated distribution cost continue through the fourth quarter. Investment in brand building as a percentage of sales was unchanged for the full year.","Comparable operating profit in Europe increased by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of net deflation in cost of goods sold, including strong productivity savings, the timing of investment in brand building and cost discipline and overhead.","Comparable operating profit declined by 4% in Latin America in the fourth quarter. Benefit from top line growth of more than 7% was more than offset by the timing of costs, including a double-digit increase in investment in brand building to support second half product launches across the region.","Fourth quarter comparable operating profit increased by 50% in the Asia-Pacific region. This was driven by solid productivity improvements and Project K savings in cost of goods sold as well as lower brand building, primarily in Australia.","Slide 10 shows full year cash flow for 2014. Cash flow was $1.2 billion, which exceeded our expectations for the year. This was driven by a benefit from year end U.S. tax legislation and broad-based working capital improvements, including our supplier financing initiative. This initiative added more than $200 million to annual cash flow in 2014 and nearly offset approximately $250 million of incremental cash impact from Project K. We expect additional benefit from this program in 2015 as we cascade it across the globe.","Capital spending for the year was $582 million, at the low end of our range. This includes the impact of some timing between 2014 and 2015 as well as lower costs for certain projects.","Share repurchases for the year were $690 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4% as planned. Dividends paid in 2014 were $680 million so total cash return to share owners was almost $1.4 billion.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 and our guidance for 2015. As always this guidance excludes items that affect comparability, so please see our notes for details. We expected challenging macroeconomic environment in 2015. And the devaluation of foreign currencies also presents both translational and transactional foreign currency headwinds. So the guidance we're providing today is realistic and reflects the investment necessary to stabilize our business and return it to sustainable growth. We expect that comparable net sales will be approximately flat for the year, an improvement when compared to the performance we saw in 2014.","We expect net deflation in cost of goods sold. Overall, commodity and packaging costs are relatively neutral and we are approximately 70% covered for the year. However, we do anticipate inflation in wages, benefits and logistics costs. We expect the benefit from productivity to be 3% to 4% cost of goods, in line with our long-term goals, and we'll see incremental savings from Project K in 2015.","So if you add all of these factors together, we expect to see net deflation for the year and slight gross margin expansion. Comparable operating profit is estimated to be down between 2% and 4%. This includes the impact of rebasing incentive compensation costs, just between a 3- and 4-point headwind to operating profit growth, slightly higher than the 2 to 3 points we communicated in our third quarter 10-Q. Excluding this headwind, comparable operating profit growth would be approximately flat to up slightly. We expect brand building will increase at a rate faster than sales growth. And we expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be in a range of flat to down 2% or $3.74 to $3.82 per share. Of course, the incentive compensation headwind also impacts our earnings per share in 2015 by between 3 and 4 points.","These earnings expectations exclude the impact of 2014's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation, which currently looks like it could be as much as $0.15 per share.","The tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28% and interest expense is anticipated to be between $215 million and $225 million. We expect that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion. This includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million from Project K. So underlying cash flow is between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We anticipate the total capital spending will be in the range of 4% to 5% of sales. This includes approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital for Project K. It also includes investment to increase the capacity in our Pringles business and the completion of a new cereal plant in India.","As I said, the total incremental after-tax cash cost for Project K will be approximately $350 million in 2015, including the additional point of sales for capital spending. This makes 2015 the year with the most cash outflows over the life of Project K. We expect to repurchase between 700 million and 750 million of shares in 2015. Our current outlook for the first quarter earnings per share is that it will account for approximately one quarter of our total estimate for the full year on a comparable basis, including the impact of currency. Currently, our expectations are that the impact of currency will be spread relatively evenly across the year.","Slide 12 shows our annual EPS log, based on comparable earnings in 2014 of $3.81 per share. As I mentioned, currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.15 per share, although this does not include the impact of any significant currency devaluations we might see during the year, such as in Venezuela. Obviously, this estimate will change and we plan to update you on the impact on future quarterly calls.","We expect a small amount of costs related to the integration of distributors and other items for Pringles in 2015. And we estimate this cost of between $0.03 and $0.05 per share and expect that this will be the last year of these integration costs. While it's early in the integration process at this time, we expect that the impact on the investment in BiscoMisr in Egypt will not be material in 2015.","And finally, we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2\/3 of which will come in cost of goods sold.","Pretax P&L cost related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million, or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share in 2015, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. Obviously, the timing and cost of the projects may change over time. So we'll provide an update regarding Project K on the quarterly conference calls and at the upcoming CAGNY conference.","And now I'll turn it back over to John, for more detail on the operating segments.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Let's turn to next slide in detail regarding the Morning Foods business. Comparable net sales declined by 7.7% in the fourth quarter and by 5.7% for the full year. 2014 was clearly a disappointing year for us in Morning Foods. But we're taking the right actions to improve the performance of the business over time.","As I mentioned, we have already started to invest the savings from Project K in our food and brand building and in in-store execution. And we have stronger plans for 2015. We expect that sales in the U.S. cereal business will be down in 2015, but that trends will show a real improvement over those we saw in 2014.","The performance in the fourth quarter of 2014 was again primarily driven by the Kashi and Special K brands as it has been in recent quarters. In addition, we continue to face and pry innovation out of the market and this also had an impact in the quarter. However, partially offsetting these effects was better display and good performance from the Froot Loops brand, which gained share as a result of strong end market support. And we're also seeing good initial results from our Disney Frozen themed cereal, which is exceeding our expectations.","We previously highlighted some of the programs and changes we're making to the Special K and Kashi brands. And Paul Norman will discuss them in more detail in next week's CAGNY conference.","Let me just highlight a few things on Slide 15. We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast Digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers. We are investing in in-store capabilities in our U.S. Morning Foods sales force. We are investing in our food. We are launching new Special K products, such as gluten-free and protein. We are continuing to evolve the Kashi GOLEAN brand certified GMO-free. And we're making the Kashi heart-to-heart brand USDA organic.","We expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K and Kashi brands and on the cereal business as a whole. However, our plan for investment is a long-term one and the levels, content and effectiveness of the support will evolve and increase over time.","Consumption in our Pop-Tarts business declined in the quarter, again due to comparisons to good performance last year. However, we gained share in the quarter and the full year and launched a new variety of peanut butter and jelly flavored Pop-Tarts during the quarter and we expect this to improve results in 2015. As you can tell, we've been focusing on improving the cereal business and we have a lot of activity planned for 2015, some of which is beginning now. We've launched new products and redesigned food and packaging to better appeal to consumer trends. We have continued our brand support, while increasing our efforts to drive category relevance. And we're driving more effectiveness from our investment, not just the incremental work, but the core investment as well. Improvement will come over time and we're confident that we have the ideas and the brands necessary to stabilize the business and return it to growth.","Now let's turn to our U.S. Snacks business on Slide 16. Comparable net sales declined by 3.1% in the fourth quarter and by 2.4% for the full year. As we saw last quarter, and in other categories around the world, the decline in sales was largely due to consumer trends away from weight management brands.","Sales in the cracker business was low in the quarter, although sales and share were approximately unchanged for the full year. We continue to see share gains in the 3 largest brands: Cheez-It, Club and Town House in Q4. However, this good performance was offset by continued declines in the Special K Cracker Chip business due to the trends I referenced earlier. As a result, we are addressing this by relaunching Special K Cracker Chips with better taste profiles and improved packaging and with new positioning. They started to arrive in stores late in December.","We saw a decline in share of the cookie category in the quarter, largely as a result of continued declines in the Right Bites' 100-calorie pack business. This was also the result of the trends in weight management and accounted for half of that total decline in share. However, we are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in Right Bites in 2015. The business was also impacted by lower distribution as Keebler special edition items exited the market.","Also in the cookie segment, we saw continued growth from Chips Deluxe as a result of the new products co-branded with M&M's. These products were linked to basic growth and consumption and share for the brand in the quarter and for the full year.","Our consumption in the wholesome snack category declined in the quarter and we lost share. However, the trends in consumption improved. Both Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats saw increased consumption and share in the fourth quarter and for the full year as a result of core growth and innovation.","Consumption of Rice Krispies Treats increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter. And Kashi bars posted better performance later in the year due to the launch of new products.","The declines in the business continue to be driven by Special K bars and FiberPlus bars, again, as a result of the weight management issues I've mentioned. In response, we are launching new great-tasting Special K snack bars with new packaging and new food. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world and the new products also began to arrive in stores late in December.","The U.S. Pringles business posted mid-single digit comparable net sales growth for the full year. We posted flat comparable net sales in the fourth quarter due to the timing of promotions and brand building activities and the impact of the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the fourth quarter of 2013, which led to a high single-digit comparison. We expect to see growth from this business in 2015, partially as a result of brand building support by core brand, although we have difficult comparisons against the launch of Tortilla in the first half of the year. Pringles, as a global brand, posted full year growth in all regions in 2014 and we're selling every can we can make around the world.","So as we expected, our U.S. Snacks business continued to face challenges in the fourth quarter. As with the cereal business, we anticipate that improvement will take time. However, we've identified the issues, which was centered on our weight management brands and we're beginning the investment necessary to stabilize this business and return it to growth. We're taking the actions now that will start to drive improvement in the future.","Let's turn to Slide 17 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1% in the fourth quarter. Comparable net sales for the full year declined by 1.4%. In the fourth quarter, Kellogg gained share in the convenience channel, in the wholesome snack, cracker and salty snack categories. Total net sales in the convenience business increased at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, partially as a result of introduction of new products. [indiscernible] in 2014 built on high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Note that we reduced sales in low-margin custom products in Q4 and the full year in this segment. We have great plans for U.S. Specialty in 2015 and expect full year sales growth as a result.","Slide 18 shows the performance of the North America Other segment, which saw an increase in comparable sales of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This segment includes the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses.","Comparable net sales in the Frozen Foods business declined slightly in the quarter. Consumption of Eggo waffles is improving, as we relaunched the Leggo My Eggo brand building program and launched Eggo gluten-free in a new variety of Thick & Fluffy waffles.","We are also in the middle of launching Eggo handheld sandwiches. These are an all family breakfast sandwich. And although it's early in the process, the initial results have been encouraging. As a result of this launch and good performance from our Special K handheld sandwiches, sales of our total sandwich business increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter and we gained share.","Finally, for the Frozen Foods business, we have new Special K products scheduled to launch in April and we've also seen good results in our Morningstar Farms, Roasted Garlic and Quinoa burger, which is non-GMO and made with organic ingredients. So we've got a lot of activity planned for this year and we expect this business to return to growth in 2015.","Beef [ph] sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the Canadian business in the fourth quarter. Consumption growth in the Canadian soup [ph] category has improved significantly and our sales were approximately flat for the quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region declined by 0.7% in the full year and by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. We saw good growth in the snack and emerging market businesses and some continued challenges in the developed cereal markets. We saw a double-digit net sales growth in emerging markets in the fourth quarter. Specifically, both the Med Middle Eastern business and the Russian business posted good results in the quarter and for the full year. And you may have seen that we recently announced an investment in BiscoMisr, the largest biscuit manufacturer in Egypt. The biscuit category has been performing well in Egypt. And this is a great investment that will add additional growth to our current Middle Eastern business and we're also excited about the potential for geographic expansion. Chris Hood, the president of our business in Kellogg in Europe, will give you more detail regarding this next week at CAGNY.","As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, the developed cereal business in Europe continued to face challenges similar to the ones we've seen in the U.S. We ran brand building activities in the second half of 2014 and we've got more new products and brand building launching in the first quarter of 2015. Mueslis, like the one you can see pictured on the slide, are just one example of the new foods we have going into market in various regions. This is great tasting cereal in a resealable pouch and is an example of the kind of work we've been doing to improve our foods.","We're also running a popular promotion across the European region that allows consumers to receive a personalized spoon and we're launching new porridge in the U.K. and Ireland. New Special K advertising has recently gone on air in the U.K, which addresses some of the recent health and wellness trends we've seen and we're launching a new variety of Krave Tresor across the region.","The Pringles business posted growth of 6.5% in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we posted the highest sales of any quarter in the history of the business. We've also got new products launching, including the Tortilla Pringles, which have been very successful in U.S. and we have more capacity coming online at mid-year. So we achieved some success in the region in 2014 and we are optimistic that we can build on this as we enter 2015.","Slide 20 shows the performance of our Latin American business for the quarter and the year. Comparable net sales growth was 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. This group performance was primarily the result of growth in Venezuela, Mexico, Mercosur and the broader Pringles business. The cereal business in Latin America saw good growth in the fourth quarter, although the competitive activity we mentioned last quarter continued in Mexico. Children's cereal contributed to the growth of the business in the region as a result of good brand building programs and product introductions, including new Zucaritas and Choco Krispies.","We are also addressing challenges in the adult segment with new commercial plans and the renovation of Special K and All-Bran, 2 of our largest brands in the region. In addition, we have executed parent brand programs, including the Breakfast for Better Days program, which has been well received. We're also launching other great products in the region in 2015 and are working to expand the overall distribution of our cereals.","The Pringles business continued to do well in Q4, posting mid-single-digit comparable sales growth. We've seen a good initial reaction to new Tortilla Pringles and the execution of the launch has gone well. And we've also recently launched Kellogg branded granola bars in the region.","So we ended the year well as a result of good activity and we have more planned for the coming months. We expect to increase investment in brand building in 2015 and expect good growth in both comparable sales and comparable operating profit.","Now let's turn to Slide 21 in our Asia-Pacific business. The Asia-Pacific segment posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1.2% in the fourth quarter and growth of 0.7% for the full year. Strong results in Asia were offset by issues in the developed cereals business in Australia. The Asian business posted double-digit net sales growth in the quarter with the Indian, Japanese and Southeast Asian businesses all achieving double-digit sales growth. The Southeast Asian business benefited from strong parent brand activation and the Japanese business saw continued good growth in the granola segment.","The Australian cereal business continue to face pressures similar to those seen in other developed businesses and results were also impacted by the year-over-year timing of promotional activity in the fourth quarter. The Pringles business posted good sales growth due to good results in Australia and strong growth in much of Asia.","Finally, the joint venture we have in China posted significant double-digit net sales growth as both cereal and Pringles businesses continued to contribute.","So we had a good fourth quarter and full year in Asia. We have some challenges in the Australian cereal business. We've already begun initiatives and have launched new products that will help address the situation. We expect stronger growth across Asia Pacific in 2015.","Now let's look at Slide 22 and the summary. Project K remains on track in 2014 and is beginning to provide significant flexibility to reinvest in the business. In 2015, we will continue to invest across the path to purchase: Desire, Decide, Delight. We will continue to invest in brand building and we have more programs launching now and across the balance of the year that will support our new foods and our existing products. We are bringing it all to life in store with increased sales capabilities and are starting to see better execution and improvement in the results. And we've made significant improvements to our food in order to meet the rapidly changing views of consumers regarding health and wellness. This includes new foods and new packaging and the reformulation of many of our existing foods.","So 2015 is a rebuilding year for us. It's an opportunity to invest in great food and ideas and to build a solid platform for long-term growth. As I'm sure you can see, our Kellogg employees are dedicated to returning the company to growth. They are executing Project K, they are delivering the savings, they are developing the growth plans and they are implementing the plans. It's thanks to them that in 2015, we can build a platform for future growth.","And with that, I will open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, I just want to ask you about the reduction in long-term sales guidance. You've spoken pretty recently that you believe you can achieve that mid-single digit operating profit growth even in an environment where you're only generating 1% to 2% internal sales. So that's consistent. But does that guidance only hold true during this period of accelerated savings in Project K? And is it feasible to sustain that, I guess, 50 basis points of annual margin expansion beyond the conclusion of Project K, when you'll be more reliant just on ongoing productivity? And secondly, is there any implied change in your cereal category expectations that are baked into that 1% to 3%?","John A. Bryant","So Matthew, as you think about how economics work, we're not relying upon Project K to drive bottom line results. We've said before we're reinvesting Project K back into the business and that's our primary objective, as we drive the business back to sustainable long-term growth. So we've got to get this business back into growth. If we can achieve 1%, 2% growth, 3% on the top line, and we can offset inflation with underlying productivity programs, that gives us gross margin expansion because of the leverage we get through our manufacturing facilities. We can have modest investment back into our organization and into our brand building programs and still deliver mid single-digit operating profit growth. So the way our economics work is we are quite a leveraged P&L. Small amounts of top line growth can lead to mid-single digit operating profit growth, irrespective of Project K. In terms of our views long-term on the business and the category growths, we continue to believe that Europe and North America can grow low single digits and Asia-Pacific and Latin America can grow mid-single digit and even mid to high single digit in the case of Latin America. And we'll talk more about this at CAGNY next week. As I think about our developed cereal businesses, we believe we can return our developed cereal business back to growth. However, we think being pragmatic, that growth is pretty much at the low end of the low single-digit kind of range, where those categories have historically outperformed over the last 5, 10 years. Again, we'll show you some of that information at CAGNY next week. So the key reason for us changing our guidance was to really remind investors that even though our average growth over last 10 years has been about 3.5% on the top line, we really only need low single-digit growth to make the mid-single-digit operating profit algorithm work, and then we generated a lot of extra cash that enables us to buy back shares and get to the high-single-digit EPS and pay a good dividend, which can even get us to double-digit tiers, all else being equal. So that low single digit is obviously is our goal internally. It's important to have those realistic goals. We will aspire to do better, but we believe we can absolutely achieve the low single-digit growth over time.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And I know one question but just to quickly follow-up on the reinvestment sort of initiative within Project K. Clearly, you're rebuilding this year. But if the top line recovery doesn't materialize the way you expect, would you be willing to change the way you think about that balance between reinvestment and bottom line going forward?","John A. Bryant","Matthew, again, we don't need to get a lot of top line growth, but we do need to get top line growth to make the economics of the business work. It's very hard to save your way to prosperity. I think ultimately, we have to grow our way there. We don't need a lot of growth, but just even low single-digit growth makes a lot of difference to how our economics work. And that's why we're absolutely focused on investing the money back into the business to ensure we get sustainable, long-term, low single-digit top line growth.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","John, I just wanted to ask a kind of big picture question. I wonder if, if anything that -- how close is Project K getting to either the innovation process or the service and delivery process where maybe it affects the mindset of Kellogg in such a way that there's a, maybe, a trade-off on growth? I mean, maybe it focuses certain segments of the organization on saving versus growth? I know for a long time Kellogg has great history of reinvesting cost savings and that people understand that savings leads to more investment. Where, now it seems like you're more dependent on that or that savings has become a bigger feature of the earnings growth. Let's look at it that way and of the amount of investable dollars generated, does this emphasis in cost savings, is that part of the reason we're seeing your deceleration and such tough growth across the businesses?","John A. Bryant","Jon, I think Project K is instrumental in helping us return to growth. There are parts in an organization that have to be absolutely focused on productivity and efficiency. So we have our supply chain, we have our global business services organization, they are designed to ensure that we are being as efficient and effective as possible. We have other parts of our organization, sales and marketing, where we still want them to be efficient obviously, but it's much more about driving the top line. And in fact, if you look at what we've done with the Project K savings in 2015, we've invested it back into the capabilities that, over time, will enable us to grow our top line. So we've invested back into our global category teams. We've invested back into rebuilding the Kashi team. We've invested back into our sales force in snacks and the Morning Foods in the U.S. Those investments do not provide an immediate return. Those investments provide returns over time because you have to invest in the people, then they start to generate the ideas. They start to bring these ideas to market. So these are not short-term payback reinvestments. But I can assure you that we have the conversation internally. We have our organization focused on returning to long-term growth. We have some parts of our organization absolutely focused on being more effective and efficient. It's about doing both well.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, I think if I heard you right, you mentioned the cost structure performance. I think you termed it as mixed. I think with good work in Europe, Australia, but I guess more work needs to be done in the U.S. I think just given that's such a strong piece of what's driving obviously the reinvestment this year, I guess what -- if you could just get a little bit more detail on what were the issues in the U.S. and I guess where maybe some of those future opportunities lie?","John A. Bryant","So Andrew, we are committed to -- I'm sure we have a very cost competitive manufacturing network around the world. We've made some strong progress in markets like Australia and the U.K. where we worked with our unions to ensure we have a more competitive labor situation and we've closed in excess capacity. In the U.S., we've closed in excess capacity. We're still working with our unions to ensure that we have a cost competitive position as well.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So it's more timing in the process, more than...","John A. Bryant","It's more where we are in the process. I mean, we are absolutely committed in the U.S. to having a competitive cost structure. We're not quite there yet. There's a couple of different parts we can go down to get there. But we're committed to working with our employees to try to get there.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Sloane with Societe Generale.","Alex Sloane - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just a question. Obviously, you've talked a lot through the presentation about 2015 being a year that you're building a platform for growth in the years to come. Are you still confident that you can do that with your current category mix or given the continued weakness in 2014, might you consider using your balance sheet in cash flow to perhaps build positions in adjacent categories, where growth prospects might be better and you might be able to leverage the Kellogg's master brand?","John A. Bryant","We are focused on returning our business to growth over time. Our soup business has been weak largely in 4 developed markets. One of those markets, Canada, is always [ph] seeing significantly better trends and the category has been more flat here recently. The U.S. is starting early days here in 2015, but seeing some better trends in the early part of '15. And I think we still have some challenges in markets like the U.K. and Australia. So we are seeing improvement from where we were. And we have confidence that we can get these businesses back to growth, not high growth, but back to modest -- at the low end of a low single-digit range type growth. In terms of acquisitions, you've seen us do the acquisition in Egypt of BiscoMisr to relatively modest sized business, less than $100 million of sales. But it's the leading biscuit business in Egypt and is a great example of the intersection of emerging markets and snacks in an area where we're very interested in continuing to build that business over time. But I wouldn't say we're looking at transformational type acquisitions in terms of really major, major category evolution type acquisitions that fundamentally changes the shape of the company. However, we continue to be very focused in growing our breakfast business and growing our snacks business around the world.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, you talked about the consumer move away from weight management. Is this being replaced in your view by a search for simple high-quality ingredients and perhaps satiety? And building on that is, is the key to the future of the domestic business in particular, and in particular, your premium cereal brands like Special K and Kashi? Then renovation side, you mentioned that you're doing renovations. Are they, perhaps, working in ways that we can't see yet? And what gives you confidence that it will work?","John A. Bryant","Thank you. I think that Special K, there's 2 issues there. One is how we've been talking about the brand and the second is the delivery of some of the foods. So in terms of how we've been talking about the brand, we got ourselves into a 2-week challenge, starting to get close to dieting the -- basically asking people to deprive themselves where they have less calories. And really, people want to have weight wellness. They want to be eating great food because it's good for them. And we actually have foods that deliver upon that promise. And those foods will continue to be in the market and unchanged. And we have other foods that we've renovated to be more in line with what consumers are looking for. So for example, we have renovated the Special K bar line here in early 2015 and we're seeing some initial good results. So what gives me some confidence that we can move the food to be more on trend? One would be our experience in Australia, where we launched the Special K Nourish cereal in 2014, that actually now has the Special K business back to growth in Australia, although Special K is a smaller brand for us in that market than it is in many other markets. So we've demonstrated that changing the foods -- so to your point, it's simpler food, it's clearly less refined, if you like. And that's what I think consumers are looking for as well as satiating, so it can be a bit more of a complicated eat and maybe some protein in there as well. And we have an opportunity to both change the communication in Special K. So it's more about weight wellness as well as changing the foods that's more aligned with consumer trends. Early days in the U.S., but even here at the very beginning of 2015 we're seeing meaningfully better results from the Special K wholesome snacks bars and Special K Cracker Chips and even from some of our cereal programs.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is kind of a follow-up to David's question. But -- you talked about repositioning Special K. It's a really important brand for you globally. And I think consumers still think of it as a diet, kind of a weight management brand. And I look at the packaging that's still on the shelves and I see the big K. And all I can think about is can't pinch an inch and the 2-week challenges. It just -- it doesn't seem on shelf to be very different from how it's been in the past. And I guess secondly, what kind of feedback do you have from consumers that they can look at the brand differently? To me, Special K means weight management.","John A. Bryant","Well, and Robert, I don't think we're trying to move Special K away from helping people look great and feel good about themselves and have a wonderful start to the day. That's very much where we are. I think we just -- in the spectrum of weight management moving from more dieting to weight wellness to -- rather than holding back on calories to having great food that really makes you feel good about yourself and it gets you off to a great start to the day. So I would say it's more of a sort of repositioning is the right word, relaunch of the brand perhaps with new food, new packaging and new communication. And I'm not sure what stores you've been in or when you're in the stores looking at the packaging, but we have changed a lot of the packaging, particularly on the snacks side here in early 2015. But this is not a radical shift of the brand. This is just improving the positioning of the brand so it's more on trend with what consumers are currently looking for.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know you say it's early days, but do you have any feedback yet from consumers as to whether in the U.S. they are looking at it differently?","John A. Bryant","I hesitate because the programs have only been in there for the beginning of '15. We were down significantly in Special K last year, and Special K sales are flat here in the first 4-week period, but it's only a 4-week period. So I don't want to draw too much from that.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I'll turn over to the U.K. market. It seems as though the issues over there are quite different from what we're seeing in the U.S. with the hard discounts [indiscernible] are really shaking things up with the regular grocery stores. Can you talk a little bit about how that's shaping up and whether it's reasonable to expect improvement in sales, particularly in cereals, but also in snacks over in the U.K. at present?","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Alexia. Hard discounts are certainly putting the U.K. retail trade environment under significant pressure. We've seen some of those U.K. retailers react to hard discounts with significant price rollbacks. And we'll see how that plays out. I think it's too early to conclude how that's going to impact the market. We are struggling a little bit in that environment and we have pragmatic expectations for the U.K. business, given the environment the U.K. is going through. Having said that, we continue to see good growth from Pringles in the U.K. business. And we have an opportunity, I think, to do better in our cereal and our cereal snacks business. So we are looking to see improvements in the trends in the U.K. But I think it remains a difficult market for us, given, as you say, that unusual retailer backdrop.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Simon, a couple of questions. So with the change in the long-term target on the top line, John, which I think is reasonable, could you also kind of frame that like cereal versus snacks globally? Because you've underperformed in snacks and that's kind of been maybe more of the unexpected drag as opposed to cereal, which is kind of more of a, call it a developing market category issue?","John A. Bryant","So I think, Eric, in general, we would expect, in developed markets, for our snacks business to grow faster than our cereal business. I think in developing and emerging markets, they can both grow at very similar sorts of rates. I would also agree with you that very disappointing result in 2014 was in our U.S. Snacks business. I think if you get beyond U.S. Snacks and you look at snacks also around the world, we've actually seen very strong growth in our international snacks business. So I think our weakness in snacks is more focused in the U.S. and quite frankly, in the U.S., where that weakness occurs more around the Special K brand, in Special K Cracker Chips and in Special K bars and wholesome snacks.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then kind of somewhat related, but I'll admit that Canada haven't been tracking as much. It sounded like that actually ended the year pretty solidly for you. Did -- was that -- was that in any case, in any way, like an R&D on Special K and recovery in cereal? Like, is there something that you've learned about the positioning of the product there that's kind of helping that business? And how long did it take to kind of -- if that's true, how long did it take to recover there?","John A. Bryant","Eric, we have a very strong team, very strong business up in Canada. When we did the parent brand activity earlier in 2014, the cereal and milk program, we got tremendous response from Canadian retailers and from Canadian milk providers. And that program really made a meaningful difference in Canada, whereas it did not have the impact we were hoping it to have in markets like the U.S. Since then the Canadian business has been performing better, sort of more low single digits in the first part of the year, it's been more flat in the back part of the year from a cereal category perspective and our share has been relatively stable within that category. The Kashi brand is growing in Canada. So there's one difference between the 2 markets right there. But I think the experience in Canada does give us reinforced belief that we can return these businesses back to growth. Of course, Canada remains a very difficult market. It's got a difficult retail environment. So we're very pragmatic on expectations in that market, but it's good to see the consumer respond to the programs.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Ron, I can't let you get off the hook without asking a little bit about currency in Venezuela. So I guess you're still getting like cash from the government and you're still at the 6 rate?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We are in this outlook, Eric. Remember, the valuation and translation of our sales and profits are based on facts and circumstances. We know and I'm sure you saw the government of Venezuela came out with a communication around exchange rates. The official rate remains, our business remains a priority business or priority industry. Remember, we produce locally and most of the inputs that go into our food is brought in locally as well. For those inputs to come from outside of the country, we are getting access to dollars at the official rate as well. We will obviously provide disclosures within our 10-K and have in our past 10-Qs in terms of the impact. If we were to move from the official rate to a SICAD 1, which, remember, is about VEF 12 to the U.S. dollar, our latest outlook is that, that could be approximately $0.18 of earnings per share impact. That includes both the onetime write-down of the net assets as well as a translational impact if, for example, that change were to occur here in the first quarter. I believe the SICAD 2 rate goes away, based on what the government recently communicated. I'm not sure where the secondary rate will go that they have communicated. It looks like it could be around VEF 120 to the U.S. dollar. If that were the case and if we were to value to that level, it would be about twice the impact of moving to SICAD 1.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This feels like it's a bit of a cathartic rebase for next year, but then we just get off the last question, where you're saying, \"Well, we may have sort of $0.18, $0.30 incremental downside of Venezuela deval.\" Why wait? Why not, proactively, like so many other companies, just move your accounting there so we have this clean base and not a continued overhang?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Look, we're valuing the business according to the right accounting, based on our facts and circumstances, Jason. I can't comment on other companies' facts and circumstances and why they may have moved off of the official rate. But for us, as I said, we're still a priority industry, and we're getting access to dollars at that official rate. So we're valuing appropriately.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then to understand a bit more on the spend. I suppose we'll get more detail. I hope we get more detail on where you're putting all this money at CAGNY. But one thing you cited is incentive compensation. And it kind of surprises me, given that you've taken so many efforts to shrink your employee population over the last year. And obviously results are pretty disappointing. So can you understand -- can you help me understand what's changing to drive so much higher incentive compensation on a go forward?","John A. Bryant","Well, I think Jason, as you know, we have a pay-for-performance orientation. And unfortunately, our performance in 2014 was not what we had hoped it to be. And so we've paid out below the target rates in 2014. In 2015, those incentive compensations just go back to the target. This is an incentive compensation program for the entire company. We have literally thousands of people within this incentive compensation program. So it is just a reflection of really underperformance in 2014 and going back to target in '15.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions for me. First, on your sales growth guidance. What is the foreign exchange impact to the top line?","Ronald L. Dissinger","The foreign exchange impact is around 3 to 4 points, David, at the top line. And frankly, as you cascade down the profit and loss statement, it's very comparable at operating profit earnings per share as well.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, kind of a bigger picture question here, guys. Project K, I think you said $90 million to $100 million of savings generated into 2015. This is the first kind of really big year of savings from Project K. Your productivity programs, again, I think you said in line with historics, kind of 3% to 4%. And against cost of goods sold, that's something like $300 million or more. So in total, you guys would be producing savings of north of $400 million, which is like $0.80 a share. I think the management comp number, 3% to 4%, that's like $0.15. I guess I want to understand that when I put these numbers together, it just feels like you should be in a much better environment from the internally generated savings than what your bottom line earnings are showing. So where's all the money going if the $0.80 saving is right, if management comps only $0.15, if sales are comparable year-on-year, how much is brand building, building up? And how much is SG&A in total going up, such that we're going to see a $0.20 decline in earnings year-on-year?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Well, David, maybe I'll walk you through the guidance, just to give you an understanding. So our guidance is realistic and it does reflect improving trends, including investments that are going back into our business around innovation, investments into our food as well and investments into our commercial programs, for example, into brand building. Of our sales, it is estimated to be approximately flat. I said we expected also slight net deflation in cost of goods sold, which should give us a slight improvement in gross margin. Keep in mind, we are seeing inflation within cost of goods sold. Our commodities, as I commented, are relatively neutral to down slightly. We are seeing increases in our factory costs and wages and in benefits and in higher logistics cost as well. Not so much around fuel. We can see that fuel is declining. This is more around carrier rates and the supply and demand impact on carriers. We also have a little bit of transactional FX exposure that sits in cost of goods sold as well. And then as I said, our operating profit is down 2% to 4%, but that includes a 3- to 4-point headwind associated with the incentive compensation. We are investing in brand building. We are also investing, as we've discussed before, in sales capability and other overhead to drive the growth of our business impact to sustainable growth.","Simon Burton","Okay, everybody, I think that's about all we have time for.

","And now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven Cahillane","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. 2019 is now in the books, and we're pleased with the progress we made. We stayed on strategy and on plan all year long, and we did what we said we would do right through Q4. And this was in spite of significant changes in investments made throughout the year, all aimed at building a solid foundation for steady, dependable financial delivery. The primary goal of 2019 was to return to organic net sales growth, and we did that. In fact, Slide 5 shows that we sustained our accelerated growth right through the fourth quarter. ","For the quarter and for the full year, this was our best organic net sales growth in several years, and this return to organic net sales growth is the strongest evidence that our Deploy for Growth strategy is working. We grew in all four quarters with full year growth in all 4 regions. We utilized revenue growth management to restore positive price realization in all regions, and we improved our end market performance in key countries and categories. ","Even as we were delivering on our 2019 plans, we were busy driving important changes intended to build a foundation for the future. Some of these changes and investments are shown on Slide 6. We significantly restructured our organization in 2019, starting with North America at the beginning of the year, followed by corporate and then the international regions. With reduced layers and fewer business unit silos, we can now assess resource allocation more holistically and make faster decisions. ","From a portfolio standpoint, we divested 4 businesses in a single transaction. This divestiture improves our portfolio's underlying growth rate and its profit margins while enabling our organization to sharpen its focus on our core businesses. We also enhanced our financial flexibility by using the divestiture proceeds to pay down $1 billion of debt. And from an investment standpoint, we continue to expand and build scale in emerging markets. In addition to growing our existing businesses, we rapidly built up distribution of Kellogg noodles in Africa. We established local production of Pringles for the first time in Africa and Latin America as well as noodles in Egypt and South Africa. And we shifted production of cereal in Brazil to a new, more efficient facility. ","There was some upfront capital and costs related to these moves, but they will facilitate profitable growth well into the future. All of these business and portfolio realignment actions were large and important, and they contribute greatly to the foundation we are building. It's also important that we delivered the results that we had guided to. Amit will go into more detail in a moment, but I want to emphasize that our return to dependability starts with doing what we said we do, and this includes delivering on our financial guidance. ","We plan to sustain this dependable performance in 2020, including a more balanced financial delivery. Again, Amit will walk you through the specifics in just a moment, but the key elements of this balance plan are depicted on Slide 7. First, we plan to continue to grow our net sales organically in 2020 in the 1% to 2% range that we think is sustainable. It should feature a little more balance between volume and price\/mix. And again, it should be broad-based, and it should be led by our biggest, most differentiated brands. ","Second, we plan to improve our underlying profitability, swinging to operating profit growth, excluding the divestiture impact. We'll continue to gradually improve our gross profit margin as we continue to utilize revenue growth management, generate productivity savings in our supply chain and complete the restoration of On the Go margins. We'll also continue to manage our overhead tightly. Third, we will increase our investment behind our brands. Some of this increase is related to specific pullbacks we had to do in the first half of 2019 such as when we pause RX advertising during its supplier-related recall and paused investment in U.S. cereal as we harmonize pack sizes. And most of the increase is around new opportunities. ","For example, our launch of Incogmeato, ready-to-cook meat alternatives, and our Pringles and Pop-Tarts commercials during the Super Bowl. In U.S. cereal, we're not just lapping the harmonization-related pullbacks. We're going all-in on a comprehensive plan. And internationally, there are other promising product launches and expansions. These are all unique opportunities, and we are reinvesting the profit of a 53rd week this year to help offset this increase in investment. And finally, we'll continue to enhance our financial flexibility, not only by improving our cash flow, but also by using that cash flow after dividends for paying down debt. In short, we're planning for a more balanced delivery with prudent forecasts as we build a foundation for sustainable growth. ","So with that, let me turn it over to Amit who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Amit?","Amit Banati","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our quarter four and full year 2019 results are summarized on Slide 9. We finished 2019 with a quarter four that again featured sequential acceleration in organic net sales growth and sequential improvement in gross profit margin. It also featured increased investment in A&P and effective overhead management. Excluding the year-on-year impacts of the divestiture, we delivered another quarter of operating profit growth, and we delivered good cash flow. All in, it was a solid finish to the year. ","The results were obviously affected by the divestiture, which closed at the end of July. The absence of these businesses results in quarter four had a negative impact on reported net sales, and it more than offset our base business growth in operating profit and earnings per share. We'll go into more detail on net sales and operating profit in a moment. Our earnings per share finished in line with the year ago fourth quarter as the negative impact of the divestiture was offset by base business profit growth and favorability in some items below operating profit. Interest expense decreased in quarter four as expected, owing to using divestiture proceeds to pay down debt. Other income in quarter four was similar to recent quarters in absolute dollars, but year-on-year, it was very favorable because of lapping the impact of the quarter four 2018 soon in financial markets, which impacted our insurance investments. Our effective tax rate benefited from a modest tax benefit. ","Our cash flow was also affected by the divestiture, specifically by almost $500 million. As discussed previously, this was not just the absence of the divested businesses' profits. This impact also included upfront costs and working capital timing differences as well as, most significantly, taxes on the divestiture proceeds. Remember, the proceeds are not in the cash flow, but the taxes, some $255 million, are included in the cash flow. Excluding this divestiture impact, our base business cash flow was quite stable. ","It's important to note that we finished 2019 on our guidance for each of the 4 guided metrics whose only changed during the year had been to incorporate the divestiture. As Steve mentioned, we're aiming for improved predictability and dependability, and we demonstrated that in 2019, even despite reorganizations, investment shifts and some near-term macroeconomic challenges, particularly in the second half. ","Let's now go into more detail. We'll start at the top of the P&L with net sales growth on Slide 10. We continue to post strong organic net sales growth coming in at 2.7% in the quarter and bringing our full year growth to 1.9%, the high end of our guidance range. Once again, all 4 regions grew net sales organically in quarter four. ","Importantly, we continue to realize price, reflecting revenue growth management actions, and we saw in quarter four a much better balance between price\/mix and volume, both of which grew more than 1% year-on-year. Among our categories globally, snacks, again, led the organic net sales growth in quarter four, increasing in all 4 regions. Frozen foods had its best quarter of growth of the year, and noodles and other products continue to post solid growth. Cereal sales were flat in the quarter on continued international growth and a meaningful moderation in North America's decline. ","In its first full quarter out of our results, the divestiture negatively impacted net sales growth by about 5.5%. For the full year, its impact was directly offset by the positive acquisition impact of consolidating Multipro, our West Africa distributor, which anniversaried back in quarter two. Lastly, after running negative all year, currency translation was neutral in the fourth quarter. It finished the year at a negative 1.7% impact. ","Now let's turn to our gross profit margin on Slide 11. Our goal this year was to sequentially improve gross profit margin performance every quarter, and that is exactly how it played out. Looking at the buckets we have been using to explain this improvement, let's start with the mechanical impact of acquisitions and divestitures. ","The consolidation of Multipro created a headwind until it anniversaried during quarter two, and then the divestiture created a small tailwind beginning in quarter three. No surprises here, and we'll have this divestiture tailwind for two more full quarters as well as a month in quarter three. ","Next, the ongoing bucket remained modestly negative. This is our input costs, net of any productivity and savings. There was no major changes in our underlying cost inflation rate, so we had expected to see at least a little moderation, which may materialize. And while cost inflation should moderate [indiscernible] during 2020, there are some [indiscernible] that our sugar, potatoes and various types of packaging that have done more inflationary. ","And lastly, there is the growth-related bucket, which continued to moderate during quarter four as we had anticipated. We still had some negative country and category mix shifts, and we did have start-up costs on new plants. However, we were able to offset much of this with price realization and sequential restoration of margins on our On the Go pack formats. We expect this bucket to continue to get less negative over the course of 2020 as we get past brand start-ups and other costs and as productivity programs gain traction. ","On SG&A expense, we continue to realize benefits related to organizational restructurings getting back to early in the year. Partially offsetting this overhead favorability in quarter four was an increase in A&P investment. Not only will some of this increase related to shifts from prior quarters, but we also elected to add investment during the quarter. The result of our good organic net sales growth, moderating gross margin decline and year-on-year decrease in overhead was another quarter of growth in operating profit before the impact of the divestiture. ","So to wrap up 2019's financial results. Let's turn to Slide 12. We returned to organic net sales growth, which was our top financial priority. And it's important to see that we grew in all regions and across most of our important brands and categories. We made steady sequential improvement in gross profit margin performance each quarter as planned, and we'll continue to make progress in this important area. ","We invested in the future. We invested in capacity, primarily in fast-growing emerging markets, but also for certain foods and pack formats in developed markets. We invested in innovation. And while our brand-building levels were lower in the quarters that lapped 2018's large infusion of incremental investment, we supported our key brands all year, increasing A&P year-on-year in the fourth quarter. ","We delivered on our guidance for net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. And we strengthened our balance sheet, using the proceeds of the divestiture to pay down debt. This gives us added financial flexibility. ","Now let's turn to 2020 with our initial guidance, shown on Slide 13. As Steve mentioned, we believe we have a prudent outlook that delivers balanced financial results while providing the flexibility we need to step up investment behind some specific opportunities and to contend with some less favorable macro environments. We expect organic net sales growth to continue to run in the 1% to 2% range. Some businesses will do better than they did in 2019, while some will lap unusually strong performances of 2019, and others like Brazil and Nigeria, will continue to face challenging macro conditions in the near term. On the whole, this growth rate represents solid, sustainable performance. ","Excluded from the organic growth, of course, is the impact of the divestiture. The absence of those divested businesses negatively impacts net sales by about 4 percentage points in 2020. The organic growth also excludes the benefit of a 53rd week at the end of 2020, which, based on prior experience, typically amounts to about 1.5 percentage points. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit is expected to decline by about 4% as the absence of the divested businesses has a mechanical impact of approximately negative 6%, more than offsetting a return to operating profit growth for our base business. This base business growth includes a sizable increase in investment, in brands and initiatives, which is only partially covered by the benefit of a 53rd week. This projected underlying growth in operating profit, even with the increased investment, is a big positive swing from 2019 and right in line with our plan for steady, gradual improvement. ","Currency-neutral adjusted EPS is expected to decline by 3% to 4%. Again, growth in the base business is more than offset by the roughly 5% negative impact of the divestiture after considering the divestiture's full year benefit on interest expense from using the proceeds to pay down debt last year. Below the operating profit line, the various items are fairly mixed. Interest expense will be lower because of a full year of debt reduced by the divestiture proceeds, and other income will be higher because of the positive impact on pension assets of last year's strong financial markets, though partially offset by our recent decision to reduce risk in our pension portfolio and decrease our expected return on assets. ","On the other hand, our effective tax rate will be higher, mainly due to lapping 2019's discrete benefit, and our average shares outstanding will likely drift higher as we prioritize debt reduction over share repurchases. ","And finally, cash flow should increase strongly to roughly $900 million to $1 billion. This is close to our base business -- base business' normal run rate, even less -- even after the results absence of our divested business' cash flow. There are a couple of factors that definitely alter the shape of our quarters this year. The first is the year-on-year impact of the divestiture. In other words, the impact of the absence of the divested business' net sales and operating profit. This is shown on Slide 14. Remember, the divestiture has 7 months impact in 2020 as opposed to only 5 months in 2019. And it also includes the highly seasonal [indiscernible] business, which happens almost entirely in the first quarter of the year. That's why you'll see a much larger year-on-year impact in quarter one. Then the second quarter should be similar to what we saw in quarter four. And quarter three only has four weeks of impact as the divestiture laps at the end of July. ","The second factor to consider is timing of investment. As mentioned, we are increasing investment meaningfully in 2020, even reinvesting the extra profit from our 53rd week to help fund it. There are some good reasons why the bulk of this year-on-year impact is heavily weighted to the first two quarters. First, there are some businesses that are lapping deliberate pullbacks. For example, U.S. cereal had its pullback last year in quarter one and quarter two during the pack size harmonization. RX had to pull back during the first half, following its supplier-related recall. ","Second, there is simple calendar timing. For instance, Pringles and Pop-Tarts Super Bowl ad obviously had to be in quarter one. And our initial launch of Incogmeato meat alternatives is scheduled for late quarter one and early quarter two. So the divestiture impact and the investment increases are first half weighted. And then there is the 53rd week, which only benefits quarter four. ","So to wrap up our financial section. We feel good about our improved financial results in 2019, and we entered 2020 in solid financial condition and with plans for continued gradual improvement in 2020. Our goal is steady, dependable financial delivery, and we are clearly on the right track. ","And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses.","Steven Cahillane","Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America in Slide 16. North America continued to show improvement in Q4, completing a year of progress amidst tremendous change, both to our portfolio and to our organizational structure. On the face of the P&L, the results get a little drowned out by the absence of our recently divested business. The impact of the divestiture was about 9 percentage points on net sales. We grew sales organically in North America by more than 1% in the fourth quarter and slightly for the full year. Both time periods represented North America's best organic net sales growth performance since 2012. It all starts with consumption, and you can see on the slide that we improved consumption growth significantly in 2019 right through the fourth quarter. This growth was across most of our categories. It was led by our biggest, most differentiated brands, and it reflected gains in our core product lines as well as incremental innovation. ","We also grew net sales organically in our away-from-home channels in both the quarter and full year aided by good consumption growth across most of our key categories in the Foodservice and Convenience channels. From a profit standpoint, results are better than they look as the mechanical impact of the absence of our divested businesses more than offset operating profit growth in our base business in quarter four. And this underlying profit growth included a strong year-on-year increase in A&P. So even as we worked to restore top line growth in North America, we continue to make progress in improving our underlying profitability and investing for the future. ","Now let's discuss each major category in a little more detail. We'll start with snacks, our largest category in North America on Slide 17. As you can see, we recorded another quarter of solid organic net sales growth in this business. And just as it has been all year, it is driven by consumption in each of our 3 categories. This was led by the power brands that we revitalized in 2018 but was also driven by our most successful class of innovation launches in many years and other brands that we began to revitalize in 2019. ","In crackers, we continue to outpace the category on the strength of Cheez-It whose double-digit growth this year came equally from the core lineup and from this year's sensational innovation platform Snap'd. Importantly, we also returned the Club cracker brand to growth as well. We expect to continue to grow in crackers in 2020. Yes, comparisons will be tougher, but we have strong commercial plans, and we'll also have added capacity for supply-constrained Snap'd. ","Pringles continued to grow consumption in the fourth quarter despite lapping a notably strong year ago performance. Our new Wavy line has been incremental, and we also continue to grow our On the Go pack formats, including immediate consumption and multi packs. We have strong plans for this brand in 2020, and we got them kicked off last weekend with our new ad during the Super Bowl. ","So even with a recent price increase to cover sharply rising potato and packaging costs, we are confident we can continue to grow Pringles. Finally, in portable wholesome snacks, we had another good year and quarter Rice Krispies Treats is a powerhouse brand whose growth accelerated in 2019 from -- both from core growth and innovation. Pop-Tarts bounced back to growth in 2019, and we extended our brand revitalization efforts to include Nutri-Grain, which also grew consumption. So North America snacks is in good position to sustain its growth. ","Let's now turn to cereal in Slide 18. As you can see, our net sales declines moderated meaningfully in the fourth quarter as we return to full commercial activity. We've talked previously about our decision to take a big bang approach to our pack size harmonization last year as opposed to a more gradual, less disruptive approach. We do not regret it. Our shelf is immensely more shoppable, and we can cross-promote brands that we couldn't previously. ","While it meant not being able to fire on all cylinders for a couple of quarters, it's behind us. In the fourth quarter, we made our best progress yet towards stabilizing this business. In the quarter, our consumption declined by less than 1% compared to our full year consumption being down almost 3%. That's a significant moderation. ","We, again, grew share in the Taste\/Fun segment, with consumption and share growth accelerating behind Frosted Flakes and its Mission Tiger campaign as well as growth in brands like Froot Loops, Corn Pops and Krave where we ramped up our commercial activity. ","In health and wellness, our new Special K campaign and positioning went on air late in the third quarter, and we saw the brand's declines moderate further in the fourth quarter, helping slower declines in this segment overall. ","Our all family segment is the one where we haven't yet made progress. This is principally due to many leads, which not only lapped good growth in the year ago third and fourth quarters, but we didn't fully return to advertising and activity behind that brand in quarter four, choosing instead to ensure our recent production shifts were on solid footing. We expect that brand's performance to improve in 2020 as we return to full support. I recognize we talk a lot about our snacks, frozen foods and emerging markets businesses, and for good reason, but we never lose sight of the fact that cereal is incredibly important to us, and it is our legacy. ","In 2020, we'll be executing a full year of commercial activity, investing behind a plan that we feel very good about. It's a plan that includes more innovation, more brand-building and more exciting in-store activity. I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to perform much better in 2020. Make no mistake, with respect to cereal, we are in it to win it. Let's complete our North America discussion with frozen foods on Slide 19. It was another quarter of good performance. Morningstar Farms, our leading brand of frozen plant-based meat alternatives, built on its accelerated growth. Consumption in the fourth quarter increased again at a double-digit rate, again, gaining share. Impressively, this accelerated consumption and share growth has been driven across product segments, as you can see on the slide. Clearly, the breadth of our product line, along with strong brand communication, is working, and we're expanding distribution. And as we discussed, we'll enter the ready-to-cook category late in first quarter 2020 with the Morningstar, Incogmeato line. We should also note the growth we've generated in Foodservice and K-12 schools. So obviously, we're excited about our Morningstar Farms business. ","In frozen breakfast, our core Eggo from the griddle business, which encompasses frozen waffles, pancakes and French toast, grew consumption slightly year-on-year in the quarter and by almost 2% for the full year. That growth has been led by innovation in the French toast and pancakes segments as well as sustained momentum for Eggo's premium Thick & Fluffy waffles subline, which grew by nearly 30%. Kashi has also accelerated its growth in this category as we pursue a natural and organic occasion. Overall, including all subcategories, our frozen breakfast consumption declined as expected, but this reflected our continued phasing out of certain noncore products. ","As we invest behind the momentum and expansion of Morningstar Farms and sustained steady growth in Eggo, we expect continued growth in North America frozen foods in 2020. ","Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on Slide 20. We had another very good year in Europe, and the fourth quarter was our ninth straight quarter of organic net sales growth in this region, a region with some very mature markets and challenging retailer environments. ","Leading our growth has been Pringles, which finished with high single-digit consumption growth in the quarter and full year. It grew throughout the region led by double-digit gains in markets like the U.K. and Spain. Driving this growth has been a promotional program targeted toward gaming, a new innovation platform featuring Asia-inspired rice-infused crisps and continuing to expand our On the Go pack formats. We have big growth to lap for Pringles in 2020, but our commercial plans are strong, and we're executing well. We also had a good year and a good fourth quarter in cereal. Region-wide, our cereal consumption returned to growth in the second half of 2019 led by good growth in taste brands like Crunchy Nut, Coco Pops and Tresor. New packaging and positioning has returned Special K to growth in the U.K., giving us confidence in executing similar programs elsewhere in 2020. ","We're especially pleased with our performance in the U.K. overall. In that market, we grew consumption by almost 2% for the year and more than 5% in the fourth quarter. So we've got good reasons to believe we can be at least stable on cereal in Europe in 2020. We made some progress on transforming wholesome snacks in 2019 with good performance by Rice Krispies Squares in the U.K., innovation on our extra brand in France and the expansion of the Kellogg's master brand in Italy. There is still more work to do, and we have good plans for continuing to stabilize this business in 2020. ","Within Europe, we do have an emerging market, and that is Russia and Central Europe. In Russia, in 2019, we generated strong double-digit consumption growth in cereal, gaining share behind Krave and our local brand as well as the launch of Extra brand, Granola. We also continued to expand Pringles in Russia, growing consumption at a double-digit rate and gaining share. Meanwhile, we continue to expand into Central Europe. So we have good reasons to be confident in top line growth again in Europe in 2020. And with enhanced revenue growth management and a reorganization that we executed in 2019, we have room to increase investment in 2020 and still deliver margin expansion. ","Let's turn to Latin America on Slide 21. We continue to grow organic net sales in 2019, though reported net sales were affected by the divestiture. For our Latin America business, 2019 was a year of momentum, transition and economic challenges. The momentum was principally in Mexico. In this key market, we continue to drive consumption and share growth in 2019, and we did it in all 3 major categories, as shown on the slide. We have strong commercial plans again in 2020, giving us confidence that we can sustain momentum in this important market. ","The transition was in Central America where we are changing distributors, and in Brazil where we are transforming our supply chain. Specifically, we started up our first local production for Pringles in Brazil, and we moved our cereal production out of S\u00e3o Paulo into a new modern plant on Paraty site in S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o [ph]. All of these actions have strong long-term benefits, but they did result in incremental costs and temporary supply chain -- supply constraints during quarter three and especially quarter four. These issues moved behind us during 2020. ","And then there were the economic challenges. In Puerto Rico, our biggest market in our Caribbean and Central America subregion, economic softness continues to affect all categories. Meantime, Brazil is seeing softness across categories as well. While our growth in Brazil has been slowed by these conditions, we have been able to sustain consumption growth in our key categories, including cereal, cookies, salty snacks and powder drinks. ","So while the economic challenges may persist into 2020, we like how we are positioned in these markets. 2019 was not a typical year for Kellogg in Latin America, and we expect to be back in growth in both top line and bottom line in 2020. ","We'll finish our business update with our fastest-growing region, AMEA, shown on Slide 22. We finished 2019 with very strong organic net sales growth in AMEA right through the fourth quarter. Our Africa strategy continued to play out with a first full year of Multipro in our results as well as the realignment of our Middle East, North Africa and Turkey businesses into AMEA and the rapid expansion of a new Kellogg's branded noodles business. ","This paid off in strong growth. We saw good results in Pringles, particularly in the Middle East, and we started up local production of that key brand in South Africa. Though slowed during the year by challenging macroeconomic conditions, [indiscernible] continue to generate strong growth [indiscernible] competitive [indiscernible] of this business and [indiscernible] experience of our partners in managing through the [indiscernible] conditions in West Africa. ","We also generated good growth in Asia driven by both cereal and Pringles. Consumption growth for Pringles was broad-based in 2019, including the fourth quarter. In cereal, growth was aided by share gains in several markets. And in Australia, our developed market in this region, we returned to consumption growth in cereal in 2019, even accelerating growth during the fourth quarter. We also saw a good consumption and share gains in Pringles. ","So even with some economic-related slowdown in West Africa, our fundamentals are in place for continued growth in AMEA in 2020. We did incur incremental costs during the fourth quarter, some of which was related to production start-up for Pringles, but we would view these costs as temporary, and AMEA should be back in profit growth in 2020. ","Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide 24. As discussed many times, our primary objective for 2018 and 2019 was to return to top line growth as this is the hardest and most essential element of returning to sustainable, consistent profit and cash flow growth. And we achieved this. We stabilized our organic net sales in 2018, and we accelerated it to solid growth in 2019. ","Now in 2020, our goal is to grow both net sales and operating profit, leaving aside the negative mechanical impact of our divestiture. There are good reasons to be confident we can do this. First of all, our portfolio is more geared toward growth today than it was even a couple of years ago. Second, we're not only seeing multi-quarter momentum in organic net sales growth, but it's been broad-based in all regions and improving across the [indiscernible]. Third, we've improved our execution with a realigned organization, enhanced capabilities and improved service. Fourth, we're gradually improving our profitability. And finally, we're investing in promising opportunities, leaning into incremental investment in a year that has a 53rd week. ","Returning to balance growth isn't just words on paper. We're moving to the next phase of our Deploy for Growth strategy and financial operating model, focusing the organization more on profit and cash flow metrics, and we've made changes to our incentive compensation programs as well. ","We are building a foundation for growing sales, profit and cash flow dependently for a long time. 2019 was an excellent start, and 2020 will improve on it. ","As always, I'd really like to thank our organization. We couldn't do any of this without the skill and dedication of our associates. ","And with that, we'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","So look, you've been investing a lot in the business over the past 12 plus months, as you discussed, and momentum has definitely improved. I guess despite that and despite the reinvestment of the extra week this year, you're guiding underlying performance only low single-digit profit growth without any further top line acceleration. And I guess the question of the day really is, is that -- how do we think about that? Is that conservatism on your part? Is the cost of doing business really just that high? And either way, what do you think it will take to inflect that product growth a bit higher ahead of top line growth as you go forward through 2020 and beyond? I'm not sure what underlying productivity is expected to run at. Maybe that's part of the solution. But just, how do we think about the rate of further improvement 2021 plus?","Steven Cahillane","Great. Thanks for the question, Steve. I think we would consider the guidance that we're giving prudent, but I'd also underline that our swing back to profit is really a 4-point swing ex the divestiture. So from a base business perspective, from a minus 2 to a plus 2, we think, is meaningful improvement. ","And as we mentioned during the prepared remarks, from a top line perspective, it's the best performance we had in 2019 at plus 1.9% since 2012. So that's quite a long period of time. And we're guiding towards continuing that with 1% to 2% top line growth based on substantial reinvestment in the business against terrific opportunities that we see. And so we feel that's prudent, but we'll be very pleased with continuing that top line momentum, which is broad-based and across many categories. And so we think it's on strategy. It's on plan. We continue to show good progress against our portfolio. ","The reorganizations are behind us. Our service levels are improving. We're lapping some very good innovation from this year. We've got very good revenue growth management productivity plans in place. Our emerging markets continue to perform very well. And so we're pleased with where we are as we end 2019. We think 2020 will be a continued year of good positive momentum. And again, a 4-point swing operating profit as well as continued positive momentum in the top line is what we're shooting for.","Operator","The next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Two questions, if I may. First, you made reference to a comprehensive program to rejuvenate your North America cereal business. Can you give us some more context around that?","Steven Cahillane","Yes. I will, Jason, thanks for the question. I'm not going to give a lot of detail, obviously, because -- for competitive reasons. But the whole price package transformation that we underwent last year, as I said, was a big bang, that's behind us now. And so we entered the year in good shape. And if you look at it from a segment perspective, the Taste\/Fun segment, we did well on in 2019, and we've got good momentum. You look at things like our Mission Tiger program, complete with a college football bowl game, continues to show good momentum, Froot Loops as well. Krave, Corn Pops showing good momentum. And so that's been good. ","Our new Special K program is actually mitigating the big declines we've seen in Special K, in fact, cutting that in half against a more simple program focused on the food and focused on the wellness. It's really in our all family segment with Frosted Mini-Wheats and Rice Krispies where we have the big -- we just haven't fixed yet, and we own that, and we have to get to it. Now with Frosted Mini-Wheats, we see good promise in front of us. We know that we held back on a lot of promotional activity last year based on some supply constraints we had as we were realigning our network. We know that brand responds where we've got good ideas against it. So as we look at the three segments that we compete in, as I said, we're in it to win it, and we see 2020 as a much better year for us in cereal.","Jason English","Okay. My second question, more holistically, just looking at the shape of your P&L. You're already the lowest margin, large-cap packaged foods company out there by a fairly substantial delta. And your guidance suggests that, that delta is going to widen even further next year with the overall margin compression at EBIT. You said you thought 1% to 2% was a durable growth rate for this business. Can you give us your perspective on what you think a durable margin is for this business? Because I still -- I'm a bit confounded, I look at your portfolio, and it seems like if you're operating in categories that generally offer good profit margins, and you're operating with brands at price points that should also afford good profit margins. It's not coming to the surface of your P&L.","Steven Cahillane","Thanks, Jason. I think it's an excellent question. I'll start and happy to let Amit chime in as well. What we've said all through the course of this year is we're aiming for margin expansion as we reinvest in the business and return to top line growth. And you saw that. You saw a sequential improvement in margins across the course of the year, including into the fourth quarter. And our aim is to continue that margin expansion as we go through 2020. And we're constructively dissatisfied as to where we are. So we do believe we've got ongoing opportunities to improve on that. ","We're coming off of a lot of transformation work that address many of the costs in not only our North America business, our European business as well. And as we continue in 2020, we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand margin and always relentlessly look at our cost base. Amit, do you want...","Amit Banati","I think just a bit on what Steve said. I think from a -- if you start kind of with gross margin, our goal for 2020 would be to stabilize gross margin. I think we see the input costs moderating in 2020 and would expect to offset that through a combination of pricing as well as our savings program. So from a gross margin standpoint, the goal would be to stabilize our gross margin going forward. ","I think as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are planning to increase investment meaningfully next year behind opportunities that we see in 2020 from a brand-building standpoint. And those are opportunities that we'd like to invest in to continue to drive the momentum in the top line. ","From an SG&A standpoint, that's something that we're always working on. We've initiated a number of initiatives to realign the business post the divestiture, and you're seeing the benefits of that come through on the P&L. ","And then from an emerging market standpoint, I think we're making good progress on the gross margins. Scale in emerging markets -- as the scale of the emerging market improves, we should see margin [indiscernible] in those businesses. [indiscernible] I'd say we expect to improve our margins [indiscernible].","Operator","The next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.","Robert Dickerson","Great. It's question number three on the margin side. So you just said it seemed -- it sounds like your expectation is to stabilize gross margin in 2020 [indiscernible] you're calling organic sales growth, 1 2 -- of profit around two, so maybe there's some hopeful sequential improvement in operating margin, it sounds, like as you get through the year, just given first half investment, et cetera. ","So when you say we [indiscernible] invest for growth in the top line, does that mean that you actually plan to increase your overall investments in advertising and brand support or is it more reallocation? And I just asked because, as Jason alluded to, kind of your operating margin structure relative to other peers, so to speak, is a little bit lower. Obviously, that has given mix, what have you. But on an advertising basis and brand support, it's not as if Kellogg historically was one that was like massively under investing. So yes, short question is basically, will you increase your actual dollars in that investment to get to a point to hopefully improve your margin over time, I guess, driven by volume leverage?","Steven Cahillane","Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. The simple answer to that is yes, we plan on increasing our brand-building investment to continue to drive our growth. We've said we're going to reinvest the 53rd week. We're going to do more than that. And so you could see the incremental investment above the 53rd week being a 53rd week plus, that and a little bit more. And we're committed to doing that because you see when you look at the brands that we're -- that we've revitalized and we've invested in have really responded and done very well. And so Cheez-It and Cheez-It Snap'd, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts, all showing terrific momentum in the marketplace. I mentioned cereal. ","We've got a job to do there. It doesn't come for free. And we're pleased with early indications that we're seeing around our Taste\/Fun brands, as I've said. Europe, when we look at Europe and the opportunities we have there, we see good momentum despite a challenging macroeconomic environment in many of those countries. So we see the ability to get very good ROIs on our investment. And the final thing I'll tell you is, our Morningstar Farms business continues to do very well, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks [indiscernible] brand called Incogmeato. Now I'm not going to get into exactly what we're spending against that, obviously, for competitive reasons, but [indiscernible] buying something. We're investing in a brand-new launch, which we [indiscernible] and we're going to spend against it, and we see that as a very big opportunity. ","We've got terrific food. We're excited to -- have you tried it at CAGNY when we're all there. So we're very excited, enthusiastic and committed to that launch. And we think that the investment plan that we have, the incrementality behind it will pay off and pay off well into the future because, again, what we're looking for is long-term sustainable growth that's balanced that continues our top line, continues margin expansion and gets us again this 4-point swing in 2020, which is the beginning of what we see as long-term dependable performance.","Robert Dickerson","Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on free cash flow. I think you said you now have a little bit more financial flexibility, but at the same time, pulling back a bit on repurchase activity and focusing on deleverage. Is there -- is the rationale just you'd like to have a bit more -- a little bit cleaner of a balance sheet, a little bit more firepower and flexibility going forward on the acquisition front, and there's really not a lot of net near-term benefit, let's say, vis-\u00e0-vis acquisitions to be buying back stock?","Amit Banati","Yes. I think that's right. I think it will be using the free cash flow to pay down our debt next year and create flexibility for us going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","I like to dig more a bit on the top line guidance. Organic top line guidance is disappointing. [Indiscernible] plus 1.9%, almost 2%, I mean, this year or so, I mean, in 2019, sorry. And the divestiture you did, I mean, a less performing business. I mean we were expecting more than the 2%, I mean, growth in 2020. So what is surprising also is that in all your businesses, when you highlight what you -- what to watch in 2020, it seems everything is going in the right direction. So what makes you so pessimistic in a way? And is there anything we missed there? So that's my first question. ","Steven Cahillane","Thank you, Laurent. I wouldn't call it pessimistic guidance. I'd characterize it as prudent guidance. And again, I'd just remind everybody that it's been since 2012 since we performed the way that we performed in 2019 with plus 1.9%. And so obviously, we've got some big hurdles that we'll be lapping all the successful innovations that we had in place this year that drove that performance, we'll have to anniversary. Now we're confident we'll be able to do that, but we want to be prudent in how we think about that. ","We also have challenging macroeconomic conditions in certain markets like Brazil and potentially West Africa and so forth. So do not get us wrong. We plan on continuing our momentum and investing behind our momentum, and we will continue that momentum and do better. But we think based on long-term history and the anniversary and potential macroeconomic conditions, I mean, the 2% is prudent.","Laurent Grandet","Yes. And actually, my second question is exactly about Brazil and Nigeria. You mentioned in your prepared remark, I mean, some softness coming from those 2 regions. Could you please elaborate and give us a bit more color there in terms of magnitude and what to expect?","Steven Cahillane","Yes. So if I start with West Africa. We definitely saw a slowdown, a macroeconomic slowdown. You saw it in some of our peers' results and so forth. We're still performing very well. So high single digits perform -- coming out of the fourth quarter, and we plan on continuing that. That's not the same as double digits, but high single digits in a market where there's some turbulence, we think, is quite good. ","Brazil, obviously, same type of macroeconomic conditions, consumer sentiment and so forth that's affecting consumer goods in general. Now we continue to perform well. Our cookies, crackers, our biggest categories continue to perform well, and we continue to gain share. So we don't see a reason for worry, but we see a reason for prudence. ","We're also very pleased about the supply chain changes that we made in Brazil. We moved, as I said, on a very old cereal plant in S\u00e3o Paulo to a brand-new production facility in lines in Paraty. We opened our first Pringles production line in Latin America, also in Paraty, a wonderful world-class facility. So there's a lot of reasons to be positive about those two markets. But again, emerging markets are volatile by nature, and we just want to ensure that we're prudent in our approach.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Just two, I guess, two items that I just wanted to get a better understanding of better kind of flowing through for 2020. One is the incremental investments, are those onetime in nature? Or is it sort of re-basing higher your A&C investments? And then the second related, just thinking about the operating income, is stranded overhead -- I think my reflection of the Keebler divestiture was that the stranded overheads would not really be mitigated much in fiscal '20 because you've got the [indiscernible] -- the TSA agreement, and maybe that becomes more of a fiscal '21. So if you can give us an idea of on the stranded overhead, just, again, remind us the size and then the pacing of mitigating that.","Steven Cahillane","Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. I'll start and let Amit take the second one. So you can think of some of this in terms of the marketing investment being onetime in nature, right? So Incogmeato will launch and it'll only launch once, the RX recall that we're lapping. So there's a bit of onetime. In the 53rd week, you can think is particularly a onetime event in nature. And obviously, we'll continue as we go throughout the year to be agile in how we think about investments required, but I would look towards 2020 as not being a re-base necessarily as being opportunistic investments against really interesting categories that we're competing in. Do you want to take this?","Amit Banati","Yes. Just on the stranded costs. So obviously, we've already initiated actions in terms of realigning the organization. And we've seen some benefits come through in '19, and we'd expect to continue to see some of that come in 2020. However, we are, our TSA as well. And our TSA, we expect to run through the course of 2020. So some of that, once we come off the TSA, would be addressing that would fall more in 2021. So it's a mixed bag.","Bryan Spillane","Is in order of magnitude with more of the recapture of stranded overheads fall into '21 versus '20 in terms of what's remaining?","Amit Banati","I'd say it's balanced, but there would definitely be some impact in 2021 once we come off the TSA and deal with those stranded costs. That will definitely be 2021. But we're also addressing stranded costs in 2020 and some in '19 already. So it's mix.","Steven Cahillane","Operator, we only have time for one more question, and it has to be short.","Operator","And that question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","I'll make it very short. Can you give us a quick update -- I know you talked a little bit about our RXBAR. But Steve, can you give us a quick update on whether its distribution has recovered to the extent you had hoped a few months ago? And if not, what's going on there?","Steven Cahillane","Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. A simple answer to that is yes. So it's recovered to its previous highs and, in fact, expanding beyond that. And there's a lot of really exciting innovations coming that will expand distribution. RXBAR minis, for example, you can find in the Club channel right now. RX oats continues to expand its distribution. Now we're focusing on advertising and velocities and getting that brand back to its momentum. And if you look at the latest Nielsen data, you can see that it's bouncing back. It's bouncing back nicely. We're really proud of the team there and really encouraged by the momentum that we see in the business and the potential that we see in the business.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks.","John Renwick","Thanks, everyone, for your interest, and please do not hesitate to call us today.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Karen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter 2012 results. I'm joined here by John Bryant, our President and CEO; Ron Dissinger, our Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Penegor, President of our U.S. Snacks business. As we move from being a global cereal company to being a global cereal and snacks company, our intention is to highlight different business units periodically. Todd's here to discuss our U.S. Snacks business in more detail.","The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website, www.kelloggcompany.com. And as you're aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. So for further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, August 6. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that the results we announced this morning are in line with our expectations and the guidance we gave last quarter. In fact, total internal revenue growth for the quarter was in the middle of the 2% to 3% range we expect for the full year and represented an improvement from the results we posted in the first quarter.","Importantly, we saw improvement in overall revenue trends in both the North American and international businesses, with the North American business posting both good revenue and operating profit growth. So we do feel much better about this performance and some of the traction we've achieved from actions taken in recent months. I'll speak more about this later.","The operating profit results also improved in the second quarter, although less dramatically than sales. As we told you last quarter, we expected that Europe's profit would decline at about the same rate in the second quarter as it did in the first quarter. This turned out to be the case. As you know, economic conditions in Europe continue to be difficult, but we're optimistic that we've begun to take the right actions across the region and that we will see further improvement.","So we have additional visibility because of the results we posted in the second quarter, and we are maintaining our outlook for the full year across the P&L. We're actively executing the strategy we outlined to you earlier this year. We are a global cereal and a U.S. snack company. We're building a global snack business, and the addition of Pringles is an important part of that.","So let me talk a bit more about Pringles and Slide 4. The integration is progressing well. Just as a reminder, this was a carve-out, not a straight acquisition, and was far more complicated as a result. So we're pleased that the transition is going so smoothly. Our Pringles team and the existing Kellogg teams are working very well together, and we anticipate that we will be able to discontinue our transition services with Procter & Gamble on schedule. We now have improved visibility into both the company's operations and the annual synergies that we expect to realize. We remain very comfortable that ongoing annual synergies will be in the $50 million to $75 million range we discussed with you previously. And finally, we're seeing good sales early in the third quarter and are starting to leverage Pringles through cross display and marketing activities. It is also important to note that our customers around the world have a lot of confidence in the brand, and just like us, are optimistic regarding its potential.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. If you will turn to Slide 5, you will see our quarterly and year-to-date financial summary. We posted reported revenue growth of 2.6% in the quarter and internal sales, excluding the impact of Pringles, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased by 2.3%. And that's on top of a very strong 6% internal growth in the second quarter of last year.","Year-to-date internal revenue growth was 1.1%, driven by the improved trends we saw in both North America and Europe in the second quarter. Internal operating profit decreased by 5% in the quarter against a difficult comparison of 8% last year. The timing of our planned investment in supply chain lowered overall operating profit by 5 points. So operating profit would have been flat without this impact.","You\u2019ll remember that our investment in 2012 will be at the same level as in 2011. However, shape is different given that last year's investment was skewed much more to the back half. Also, as John mentioned, Europe results contributed to the decline as did continued high commodity costs. Reported earnings per share were $0.84 in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, including $0.07 of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Pringles. We also saw below-the-line favorability of $0.02 per share, which I'll talk about in more detail later.","Slide 6 shows the details of second quarter sales growth. Reported sales increased by 2.6%, and internal sales increased by 2.3%. While volumes declined by 0.6 points, we continued to see favorable results in price and mix at almost 3 points. Importantly, sales increased in the quarter across all 3 categories: cereal, snacks and our other category, which is primarily Frozen Foods and some Specialty Channels business. Pringles added 3.5 points to overall reported sales growth as a result of the sales we picked up in June. And finally, currency decreased overall growth by 3 points.","Now if you'll turn to Slide 7. We'll look at our gross profit performance. Gross profit was $1.4 billion in the second quarter, and gross margin declined by 190 basis points. Commodity costs increased in the quarter, but productivity savings and pricing helped offset the impact. The key drivers of the margin decline were the timing of investment in our supply chain and lower production as we reduced levels of inventory. These 2 items accounted for more than half the decline we saw in gross margin. And the addition of the Pringles business also reduced our reported gross margin. As we've said in the past, however, we intend to improve the margins at","Pringles over time. It's worth noting that gross profit dollars would have been flat if we exclude the timing for the supply chain investments.","Finally, as you are aware, some commodity prices have increased significantly over the past couple of months due to weather conditions. We are now essentially fully covered on food and packaging inputs for the year, and we have included the impact of recent inflation in our outlook for the year.","Slide 8 shows details of our investment in brand building over the last 18 months. Investment was lower in the quarter, although this was the result of comparisons to strong investment the first half of last year, which supported our innovation and marketing programs. This year, we have a lot of activity planned in the second half to support commercial activities and innovation. In addition, we are a proud sponsor of the Olympics. So you can appreciate that our investment will be skewed to the second half of the year.","As you know, investment in brand building is one of the cornerstones of our operating principles. We're committed to this investment, which includes effective programs and more efficient spending, specifically through increased use of digital media. Importantly, even including these efficiencies, we still expect to increase brand building for the whole company at a rate equal to or greater than sales growth for the full year.","Slide 9 shows the internal operating performance for each of the regions. Total company internal operating profit decreased by 5% in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the year-over-year impact of our investment in supply chain accounted for all of the decline. As a reminder, we stepped up our investment in supply chain by $100 million last year and held this investment in 2012. We're getting a good return from this investment, and our supply chain is stabilized. So while the timing of the investment has been a significant headwind in the first half of the year, it will be a tailwind in the second half.","North America's internal operating profit increased by more than 3% in the quarter. This was due to strong sales growth, including volume, price and mix improvements. It's also worth noting that we achieved this growth despite the headwind from the timing of the supply chain investments I mentioned earlier.","As we expected, Europe's internal operating profit declined by 20% in the quarter. Half of this decline was the result of lower production to reduce inventory levels. The remainder was due to lower sales and consumer pressures across the region.  Europe has been a very difficult operating environment for us.","Internal operating profit in Latin America decreased by approximately 15% in the second quarter. While sales growth was strong, operating profit declined due to a one-time benefit from an asset sale last year and a very strong double-digit increase in brand building in the quarter this year. In fact, these 2 items accounted for all of the decline in operating profit.","And finally, internal operating profit in Asia Pacific decreased by almost 32%, although this was only $8 million. This was primarily the result of a continued difficult operating environment in Australia, including reductions in retailer inventories. However, we did see very early signs of improvement in the category and in our performance in Australia late in the quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 10 and a discussion of cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow was approximately $525 million, an increase of more than $120 million versus last year. As we said in the first quarter, this includes much of the working capital benefit we expected from Pringles, and we remain focused on managing working capital and made progress in reducing our inventories during the second quarter. Year-to-date capital spending was $155 million or 2.2% of sales. Full year capital spending is still expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% of sales, but it is more second half weighted and includes investment in Pringles. And we purchased no shares during the quarter. As we have said, we intend to pay down debt to strengthen our balance sheet.","Slide 11 shows details of our full year guidance for 2012. As we've said previously, internal sales and operating profit exclude the impact of Pringles, but our earnings per share guidance includes the expected accretion and one-time costs related to the acquisition. So as you can see on the chart, we've maintained our guidance for the year. As a result, we continue to expect internal net sales growth to be between 2% and 3%. This includes the impact of good price and mix growth, partially offset by decline in volume.","We also expect that reported gross margin will be down more than 100 basis points for the year, including the impact of a lower margin structure for Pringles. Internal gross margin will decline less than 100 basis points, consistent with our previous expectations. Our expectations for total cost of goods inflation, including commodity inflation, remain at approximately 7%. And again, we continue to expect that our supply chain will deliver good productivity savings of slightly greater than 3%, in line with our long-term expectations. Our estimate is that full year internal operating profit will be lower by 2% to 4%, including the increase in investment in brand building, equal to or greater than sales growth. And our guidance for earnings per share remains consistent, although some of the puts and takes have changed.","Let's turn to Slide 12 to discuss changes to some of the components of our guidance. Remember that last quarter, we had a one-time $0.05 benefit from transaction-related hedging. This quarter, we had a couple of one-time items also, including that benefit reversing itself, that combined to a $0.02 negative impact. But this was more than offset by a lower tax rate that added approximately $0.04 of benefit. So we netted a positive $0.02 impact from these one-time items in the quarter. All of these items are related to the Pringles acquisition.","As a result of the tax benefit this quarter, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 29%. Expectations for currency translation got $0.02 worse and now stand at approximately $0.06 of negative impact for the year. We've outlined all of this information on this slide. So as a result, our estimate for full year earnings per share remains in the $3.18 to $3.30 range. This includes a net $0.07 to $0.10 headwind of one-time items and the $0.06 headwind from currency. And cash flow is still expected to be in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range.","Finally, you can see from the full year guidance that we're expecting continued improvement and much better results in the second half of the year. This should be a gradual improvement, though, as we progress through the remainder of the year.","And with that, I'll turn it back to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Slide 13 shows the internal revenue growth posted by Kellogg North America and Kellogg International in the quarter. Both results represent a significant improvement from their performance in the first quarter. Revenue growth in North America was 4%. That was declined by 1% in our International business, mostly due to the results we expected in Europe.","Slide 14 shows the U.S. business broken out by segment. As you can see, each of the segments posted growth in the quarter. U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi posted growth of 1.2%. Cereal sales and share declined slightly, as we were lapping a double-digit sales growth at almost 1.5 of share gains in the second quarter of last year. So the performance was good, considering that we proactively chose to lower incremental spending during the period and we've all seen that we posted good share growth in more recent data.","The contribution from innovation has also been good, with Krave cereal continuing to do very well at 1 share point. The Pop-Tarts business had a great quarter, posting a strong sales growth, and we had a very favorable response to the reintroduction of the Crazy Good advertising campaign. And the Kashi business posted good sales growth, including the Bear Naked brand, which contributed -- which continued to post very strong growth as a result of innovation and increased levels of distribution.","U.S. Specialty segment posted internal revenue growth of 6.3%. This was a result of strong innovation, particularly Special K Cracker Chips, which are off to a great start in these channels. Also, we saw double-digit growth and good share performance in the Convenience channel and increased sales of Frozen Foods.","The North America Other segment, which is comprised of the Frozen Food and Canadian businesses, also had a great quarter. Frozen Foods had another strong quarter, posting high single-digit revenue growth off a difficult comparison. In fact, our Frozen Foods business is the fastest-growing, large Frozen Foods business in the U.S. over the last 52-week period, as measured by Nielsen. The innovation we've launched is doing well in all the categories, and Eggo Thick & Fluffy waffles posted strong double-digit growth in their second year. And we've got Special K flatbread breakfast sandwiches and vanilla Eggo waffles planned for introduction. Veggie Foods is responding to activity that started late in the quarter, and we're seeing strong growth in recent measured channel data.","And the Canadian business also posted strong revenue growth. Innovations are doing well in Canada, especially Special K Cracker Chips, which are off to a very strong start.","Now if you'll turn to Slide 15, you'll see just some of the innovation that has either been launched this year or that will be launched in the second half. The purpose of this is to give you some idea of the magnitude of the activity and look at some of the great new products that we've launched. Remember that corporate-wide, we've launched approximately $600 million of innovation in 2010. This grew to approximately $800 million in 2011, and are on course to introduced innovation of $900 million in 2012. That's sort of activity, but we know that this is essential to our future growth.","Now, I'm pleased to introduce Todd Penegor, the President of our U.S. Snacks business. As Simon said at the beginning of the call, we intend to highlight one business on these calls from time to time. Given the acquisition of Pringles and the importance of snacks to our plans for future growth, we want to take this opportunity to have Todd talk more about our single largest business unit, U.S. Snacks.","Todd Penegor","Thanks, John. First of all, let's take a look at Slide 17 and a discussion of the Snacks business performance in the second quarter. As you can see, we posted very good internal sales growth of 4.1% and this was building on strong mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter of last year. The cracker category increased at a mid-single-digit rate in all channel data, and we increased category share. As in previous quarters, both Cheez-It and Special K crackers did very well in the quarter, and we're very excited about the introduction of Special K popcorn chips in August. These new SKUs will build on the current Special K franchise, and we're confident this off-cycle innovation will continue to drive our business.","The cookie business posted low single-digit growth on good performance from the focus on the core Keebler brands. Fudge Shoppe, Chips Deluxe and Sandies all did well and in combination posted sales growth that exceeded the low-single-digit category growth.","Our wholesome snack business also had a very good quarter. Sales of Special K bars, Nutri-Grain bars and Rice Krispies Treats all grew in the quarter. You'll remember that our wholesome snack innovation for the year is much more skewed to the second half of the year, and we're starting to see some of the benefit already. Although it's early, Special K Pastry Crisps are off to a good start, and FiberPlus Nutty Delights are now being activated.","Slide 19 shows the scale of and our share in the 4 main categories in which we compete in the U.S. As you can see, these are big categories which add almost $20 billion a year in sales, and they're growing, too. So although we're strong #2 in wholesome snack and cracker categories and a more distant #2 in cookies and savory snacks, we see a lot of potential in all these businesses. This means that we have to embrace our position and act as a hungry #2. And it also means that we have to drive our execution and innovation that much harder, and we have. We've done a very good job with both over the years. I'll talk about some of these initiatives in a little more detail in a few minutes. So as I mentioned, our categories have been growing more than 4% a year, and I'd like to think that the hard work we put in by the entire team has meant that Kellogg has helped drive part of this growth.","A big part of our success is due to the strength of our brands. And if you turn to Slide 21, you'll see some detail regarding one of the most important of those brands. Cheez-It has been a multiyear success story for us. We've had some great close-in innovation over the years and have worked hard to keep the brand fresh. The purchase rate on Cheez-It is among the highest of our large brands, and you can see on the chart the impressive growth posted as a result over the last 15 years. In fact, this brand increased sales every year over this 15-year period, and the compound annual growth rate was more than 9%, which is really impressive.","Recently, Cheez-It scored highly in a study of popular savory snack brands. This survey focused on a broad array of benefits and product attributes valued by consumers and included some of the largest savory snack brands in the country. Cheez-It is a cracker and is sold in the cracker aisle. However, consumers think of it as a savory snack and they consume it like one.","We have integrated our consumer programs with our sales efforts to really drive incremental sales and build the brand. The successful Choose Your Cheese program is one example that ran over the last couple of years, and we've also got sales partnerships with Coke and MillerCoors, which we're very excited about and that will provide even more opportunities in the future. And so, as a result of these activities, we have some very passionate consumers who have driven this to be one of the largest brands in the company, with almost 3.5 million Facebook fans. Finally though, I would like to say that we don't think we've tapped anywhere near all the potential of this brand despite the past growth you see on the chart. In fact, we expect that sticking to our plan will bring many more years of success.","Now let's turn to Slide 22 and a discussion of another important brand for us, Special K, which has helped to drive our wholesome snack and cracker businesses. The Special K brand in Snacks has benefited from strong innovation, and we've seen increased household penetration and very passionate consumers. As a result, we posted strong growth in each of the last few years, and you can see it all adds to a compound annual growth rate over the period of more than 22%, which is great. In fact, the growth has been accelerated over the last couple of years by the introduction of Special K Cracker Chips, which have increased the brand's reach. And the introduction was one of our most successful in the category. The 2 SKUs we launched this year have done well, on top of a strong base set last year. It is on trend, highly relevant proposition and brand and it's successfully traveling to businesses outside of the U.S. as well. Kellogg Canada and Kellogg Mexico have both launched this product and have also seen great results. Importantly, we're confident that Special K Popcorn Chips and Pastry Crisps, both of which are being introduced in the second half of 2012 with strong support, will help keep this business growing.","Slide 23 shows some detail regarding the Keebler cookie brand, which is one of our strongest. The Keebler brand, the Keebler Elves and the Hollow Tree are all loved by consumers. Last year, we decided to focus our efforts on the broader Keebler brand and primarily Fudge Shoppe, Chips De and Sandies. And as you can see from the chart, the results have been dramatic. It's important to note that the Keebler brand accounts for $1 billion of sales across the cookie and cracker categories. We changed a lot of things as a part of this refocus: Advertising, pricing, packaging, marketing partnerships, social media activities, and we even rethought our in-store activation. And we're pleased with the performance in the latest 52-week period. As you can see, the core sub-brands under Keebler have posted strong growth, a big change from prior periods. And as with Cheez-It and Special K, we've got increasingly passionate consumers, more activity and good innovation planned, all of which should help us maintain our solid momentum.","And now you'll turn to Slide 24. The final brand I'd like to highlight today is, of course, Pringles. In U.S. Snacks, we're really excited about the opportunities that Pringles brings. This is a big iconic brand and is one that allows us to leverage our strengths: brand building, innovation and strong in-store execution. It also provides us with access to another aisle in the store. As John has mentioned previously, the business has been a little constrained on capacity. But we're doing a lot of work on this as an organization. This means that as we progress, we should be able to focus on driving sales growth, particularly through the introduction of innovation and additional merchandising, leveraging our in-store presence.","The introduction of Pringles with more flavor has helped accelerate the growth of this brand. This was a simple idea, but it's one that highlights the opportunities we have to drive this business. We've also got a lot of really great brand-building ideas, and we've got savory snack brands that complement each other. So as you might imagine, we're already co-promotions with Pringles and Cheez-It. We see a lot more potential to do this kind of thing as we look across the portfolio.","Slide 26 shows some detail on the success of our innovation that I referenced earlier. As you can see, we've done a great job driving innovation in our largest categories, in both absolute terms and versus the competition. It's also important to note that this is a 3-year rolling innovation which highlights the longer-term success of some of these ideas. We've increased the amount of innovation we've launched, measured in dollars, consistently over the last few years. So we're very proud of this track record, and I believe that we have the processes and ideas in place to continue this success into the future.","One final note on innovation. We recently have been recognized by both Nielsen and IRI for some of the successful innovations we've launched. Specifically, these are awards for our Town House Flipsides, Special K Cracker Chips and Special K Pastry Crisps products.","Now let's turn to Slide 27 and the final element of our growth strategy, the DSD delivery network, which is one of the largest in the country. Let's look at some of the impressive statistics on the page. As you can imagine, visiting each store more than 4 times a week on average puts us in regular contact with both our customers and consumers. The number of visits also helps us manage the shelf and minimize out-of-stocks. And we can't wait to build on our in-store presence to drive even more display for our Pringles business.","So in conclusion, on Slide 28, I'd just like to say that we're very motivated by the opportunities we have in the U.S. Snacks business here at Kellogg. There is great potential in all the categories in which we compete. These categories are growing, and we're benefiting from this. We have the right brands. Cheez-It, Special K, Keebler, and now, Pringles, are all great brands, and we've got the opportunity to accelerate their performance as we focus, integrate and expand our efforts. We've got a great innovation plan and, as importantly, a well-run process that's been very successful. And we've executed well in-store and will continue to do so. We are very optimistic regarding our future in Snacks and we're very excited to welcome the U.S. Pringles employees to the Snacks family. And finally, I'd like to thank all the employees of the Snacks business for their hard work. Together, they've built a great organization, and they should all be very proud.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thank you, Todd. Now if you'll turn to Slide 29, you'll see some detail regarding our International businesses. Sales performance posted by our European business in the second quarter was better than we saw in the first quarter. The U.K. business also declined much less than it did in Q1 as some of our commercial plans and pricing actions started to gain traction. We have new Special K and Crunchy Nut advertising on-air. We have launched new Special K Biscuit Moments, and Nutri-Grain Breakfast Biscuits are going into the market. This is a growing category, and we see potential in this great new product. More broadly, we've got new ads on the air for most of our major brands, and we've relaunched Special K in both Italy and Spain, like we did last year in Mexico, where we saw very good sales growth as a result. We feel better about the second half because of all this activity and because of other innovations we have planned. However, as you've heard from other companies, the continent continues to be a challenge given the economic environment. Southern Europe in particular, is difficult, and we are taking action in the region and we're watching developments closely.","Quarterly net sales results in Asia Pacific were impacted by lower retail inventories and a difficult competitive environment in Australia, as retailers decreased their inventories around their fiscal year end. Australia is a developed market and has issues similar to other developed markets. However, the third quarter is off to a better start, and we have stronger activity planned for the second half.","In addition, we saw good growth in Southeast Asia, China and India, and we expect better growth across the region in the second half of the year as we have more activity planned, including a significant amount of brand building.","Sales in Latin America increased by almost 7% as a result of strong pricing and double-digit growth in certain countries. We increased brand building at a double-digit rate in Q2 and are also planning for a double-digit increase across the balance of the year. So we expect continued good revenue growth in Latin America this year because of this investment and because of innovations such as Special K Crisps and Special K Cracker Chips, which are similar to the ones you are familiar with in the U.S. Like in other places around the world, this launch is off to a very strong start.","In conclusion, I'd like to say that we have increased visibility into our International business for the balance of the year. We're taking actions across the regions, some of them significant, and we're starting to see improvement. We remain very focused, and we are excited about the opportunities we see in the second half of the year and into 2013.","Now let's turn to Slide 30 and the summary. We're pleased that our second quarter performance improved from the first quarter of the year. The North American business posted internal growth in both sales and operating profit. We've done a lot of work in these businesses, and we're encouraged by the improvement. And we're excited about the prospects for the second half.","The International business also posted improved performance, as some of the actions that we have taken have started to make a difference. We expect that this activity will drive performance that continues to improve as we progress through the second half. And because of this, we have additional visibility into our outlook for the year.","We plan to continue investing in our model because we know that it is the right way to run our business. Investment in our brands and strong innovation are what drives our results, and we're excited about both what we have planned for the remainder of this year and the longer-term prospects for the business. We compete in great categories, and we have new strong growth opportunities in our Pringles business.","Finally, I'd just like to thank Kellogg's employees for all their hard work. I'd also like to welcome the new employees coming to the family as a result of the Pringles acquisition.","And with that, I'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Hessler from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As you guys ended the quarter, I think you had like $750 million in short-term debt, and you've got a couple of notes that are maturing in the next 12 months. So I was wondering, how do you plan to address those? I know you're focused on using near-term free cash flow to reduce debt, but might we see you back in the corporate bond market in the next couple months or in the back half of the year?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, Greg. This is Ron. It is possible that we'll be back in the market. We'll obviously look at all of our options here, including a CP, as well as longer-term debt.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And in conjunction with the debt reduction, is there a particular balance that you're targeting by year end?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We haven't communicated a specific balance that we're targeting by year end. What we have said is that we like our BBB+ credit-rating, and we're working to maintain that rating by paying down our debt and strengthening our balance sheet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Europe, it sounds like you're feeling confident about the progress you're making there. Can you help illuminate some of the issues? So just give us a little more detail of exactly what the challenges have been there.","John A. Bryant","Well, I think as we said back on the first quarter call, we've been disappointed by our start in Europe. I think to your point, Jason, we are seeing much better progress in the second quarter, and our second quarter results were in line with our expectations -- the expectations we gave you coming out of that first quarter call. We have seen improvement in the U.K. and France. Having said that, Southern Europe, particularly Spain and Italy, have been a bit softer than we would like, and that just reflects the tough environment in that part of the world. To give you a sense of some of the actions that we've taken, in the U.K. we have new cereal innovation coming out, with line extensions on All-Bran, Crunchy Nut and Krave. In the U.K. we have Special K Biscuit Moments launching in June. And in Spain and Italy, we're actually relaunching Special K, which is our biggest brand there, similar to what we did in Latin America last year, where we saw a very good response from that program. And across the region, we have new proven copy behind major brands, and we've improved some price points in some critical brands in some major markets. So I think we are making some good progress, and it's coming through in a better result in Q2 than Q1.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just a housekeeping item. On your guidance bridge here, you've got, it looks like a net $0.02 benefit from one-time costs. And I know FX is an offset. But just on a currency neutral basis, if we were to exclude the one-timers, is it right that you're lowering sort of the constant currency pro forma guidance by $0.02? And if so, where exactly is that coming from?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We're not necessarily lowering the constant currency guidance. Our base or core EPS remains exactly the same. We've got $0.02 of headwind of currency.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But you have $0.02 of a net tailwind from one-time costs, is that right? That weren't included in the guidance before?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. Yes, we do.","Simon Burton","That's right, Jason. Excuse me, it's Simon. Those 2 things offset each other so...","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes.","Simon Burton","We're still at a $3.18 to $3.30.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But if FX hadn't changed -- okay, I'll follow up offline.","Ronald L. Dissinger","If FX hadn't changed, then the rates would have gone up.","Simon Burton","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to know if you can give us a little more color on how Pringles is doing. We can see the data in the U.S. but not so clearly in Europe, and this is a heavily European business. Are they having the same kind of geographic kind of slowdown in Southern Europe, and can you help us quantify what it looks like? And then secondly, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that combination of integrating Pringles in Europe and also, I think, kind of restructuring your headquarter platform in Europe? And I think a lot of people are concerned that this is a lot to take on at this time when Europe, in general, is having recessionary conditions.","John A. Bryant","Let me say a few comments first about Pringles in general and then Europe, and then maybe have Todd say a few things about what's happening in Pringles here in the United States. The integration is going very well with Pringles, very smoothly. We have good visibility into the synergies. We're having good pickup with Pringles employees now becoming Kellogg employees. And I think actually, the company's done an excellent job of executing a very difficult integration with the carve-out and moving forward. And as you say, we are seeing some good response here in the near term in the U.S, and I'll have Todd talk about that in a minute. In terms of Europe, the Pringles business is doing well in Europe. We do have more of an emerging market platform for that business than, say, the Kellogg company would have. But we're continuing to see progress in that business. More broadly, as you said, we are undergoing a major set of changes in our European business. We are organizing ourselves for the future. That means we are looking at the best way to set ourselves up. The beauty of the Pringles acquisition is it creates a snacking capability to add to our International business. It helps transform our International business from largely a cereal business to a cereal and snacks business. The Pringles acquisition or integration within Europe, Pringles will continue to be in Geneva, so there's not a big dislocation there. There is an opportunity though for us to look at how we best organize Europe, given that we have cereal in Dublin and Pringles in Geneva. Asia Pacific, we'll also have Pringles in Singapore and seeing very good progress of that integration as well. And it's a relatively small business in Latin America. So early days in Europe. A lot going on. But we think Pringles actually is an important part of the strategy to help drive the future growth of our European business. And so we feel we're absolutely taking the right long-term actions. Todd, you want to talk a little bit about the U.S. channels?","Todd Penegor","And in the U.S., it's -- the integration is also going very smooth. We haven't skipped a beat. Period 6 came in on expectations, and we're off to a solid start here in Period 7. Really excited about the opportunity to leverage our in-store presence to drive even bigger partnerships and in-store displays. And we're securing the right talent to ensure our success going forward. So feel very, very good at the moment.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And John, just 37% of Pringles sales are in Western Europe. Are those -- is that business down?","John A. Bryant","Coming into the year, Pringles had a strategy in some parts of Western Europe to reduce their reliance on some of those markets. And some of those markets are down; others are up. So it's a bit of a mixed story across the continent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. A couple of questions, I guess. First, just more specific you're looking at the tax rate, I guess, as included in the guidance, a large part of that is due to Pringles. But shouldn't Pringles help the overall tax rate long term? And should we then therefore take some comfort in the fact that you're including this benefit in the second quarter as maybe a longer-term benefit to the company?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Pringles will benefit our tax rate over the longer term based on the tax-efficient structures that are in place, Eric. What we recognized in the second quarter was a one-time benefit associated with the liability that we adjusted in relation to International earnings. We previously expected we might repatriate those International earnings. Now as a result of a debt that we have overseas, we'll use that cash to pay down the debt. So we made this one-time adjustment to that liability and picked up $0.04 of earnings per share benefit.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is -- again, just on the one-time items, the $0.07 to $0.10 that you originally -- well, you updated in this -- after the first quarter results, that -- the $0.07 to $0.10, that includes the, I guess, net $0.03 hedging gain, but that also includes a $0.04 tax benefit and then the initial one-time items that you had put out at CAGNY?","Ronald L. Dissinger","That's exactly right, Eric. So it's got the integration costs embedded, which are a headwind. It's got the benefit of this -- it's a transactional foreign exchange item of $0.03. And then it's got $0.04 of benefit related to tax.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just last question. Just kind of maybe talking about, John, the cereal business in the U.S. It looks like the category has still been a bit of a struggle. Perhaps you can talk a little bit about that. And as I go around, there are still a lot of questions about the category versus other breakfast items or even versus pretty aggressive QSR movement into breakfast. Perhaps an update there, and then I'll pass it on.","John A. Bryant","We remain excited about the long- term potential of cereal in the U.S. We see it as a low-single-digit growth category, and in the second quarter, it was flat to up 1%. So at the lower end of the range that we'd like to be operating in, but not that far out of that range. And the reason we believe it has long-term potential, obviously, is the aging population, health and wellness considerations, and we know it's a category driven by brand building and innovation. Within the cereal category in the second quarter, we were down about 1% in the U.S. but lapping a 13% growth last year. And so our share did drop down about 50 basis points, but we began lapping a 140-basis-point gain in the year-ago period. And within the category, we're actually seeing very stable base sales performance. And where the category is losing a little bit of volume is on the incremental side. I think that reflects some of the actions taken in the area of pricing through the year. But I think longer term, what's going to drive this category is going to be more innovation and more brand building. And if you look across our back half plans, we have a much heavier brand-building investment in the back half of the year, and we have new innovation like Special K Protein coming out in the back half. And if there's one thing we are seeing in general, it's a little bit of protein seeking going on, whether it be Greek yogurt or eggs or similar sort of items. And so we believe that we can play into that, even through cereal. So we're comfortable with where the cereal business is. It's improving as we go through the year. We see a better back half, and we believe it has good long-term growth prospects.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you bought your grains for this year, was that before or after the big corn spike? I'm asking because I think it's reasonable to assume it was before since your guidance for total cost inflation has remained constant even though corn and wheat and oats and so forth have jumped since you last provided an update. And the reason I'm asking is not so much about 2012 but just kind of looking ahead to 2013 and seeing if we can reasonably expect a little bit of a commodity headwind at that point.","Ronald L. Dissinger","So for 2012, we did have some grains purchased or hedges in place. We did see a little bit of exposure in the back part of the year but we've been able to manage that, Ken, and still stay within our guidance and total cost inflation expectations.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is it reasonable for us to assume that commodities overall will still be somewhat of a headwind next year?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We do expect inflation in 2013. Keep in mind, we buy $5 billion worth of commodity packaging and energy across our business. The grains are a relatively small portion of that overall purchase. But yes, we do expect some inflation next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a question separately on supply chain. You mentioned something about supply chain being a little bit disproportionately high -- investments in supply chain being disproportionately high in the second quarter. Can you give an update about how that's flowing through the year in terms of incremental spending on supply chain first half versus second half? And are you on track for that sort of, I think it was $100 million of incremental spend? And then any specifics about what you're spending that on and what that's supposed to achieve would be great.","Ronald L. Dissinger","It's very consistent with what we've communicated before, Dave. And yes, $100 million is still our expectation for spending in 2012 because we're lapping the investment we made primarily in the back half of last year. We're seeing headwinds in the front half of this year. And then we'll see a benefit in the back half of 2012.","John A. Bryant","Then, David, I'd like to say that the investments are having a tremendous payoff for us. And I really do believe it was absolutely the right thing to do. We've turned the corner with our supply chain. We're having a much, much better 2012. And those investments will enable us to continue to drive our business forward, to continue to grow the business over time. So I really feel like we -- it's been absolutely the right thing and it's made tremendous progress in our supply chain.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is there any way that you could illustrate with examples about what you mean when that -- improving your ability to execute in supply chain and what sort of increment -- any dollars in terms of what benefit that will provide?","John A. Bryant","I think it has to do with just the stability of the supply chain and the overall performance of the supply chain. If you went back over the last 3 to 4 years, unfortunately we've had a number of events that have adversely affected our company. As we went into the back half of last year, we really took the business apart, making sure we were getting down to the root causes, understanding the issues and resolving them. And as we've gone through this year, we'd have a much, much better performance out of our supply chain as a result.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one follow-up on grain costs. As we think about the impact of the recent increase in costs on discrete categories, as we look forward to next year, and specifically thinking about cereal, as it stands today, do you feel confident in your ability to cover the inflation outlook for next year through productivity? Or are we approaching the point where you think additional pricing might be required in cereal at some point during the next 6 to 12 months?","John A. Bryant","Matthew, we really cannot talk about prospective pricing. I want to get back to what Ron said. We buy a lot of different items, of which grains are just one. So we might have some inflation on that particular item but we have some other items that are not inflationary. We as a company and as an industry, are driving tremendous productivity to try to help offset our need to take pricing as much as possible, and I'm sure that will continue to be the approach of the company and the industry in general. So this is one more thing for us to manage our way through, and we'll talk about our 2013 outlook at the end of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on David's question on the supply chain. Does turning the corner there give you the confidence that you can begin to manage down that spending in the out years? And then just a follow-up, a separate housekeeping question. Have you finished the inventory adjustment and can you maybe actually give the quarter ending inventory level for the base business, excluding Pringles?","John A. Bryant","Let me answer your question on the supply chain. Our goal is to always be driving productivity to our supply chain. We see that investment of $100 million as a permanent step-up in the base. If we can do anything over time to reduce that spend, obviously we will. But we're looking at it in the context of running the total supply chain, not as $100 million in isolation. So our goal is to keep driving our productivity around 3% to 4%. That's our long-term aspiration. In terms of inventory, Ron?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. In terms of the inventory reductions, we will still see some inventory coming out over the back half of the year. So we'll have some adverse impact there. In terms of getting into the exact inventory for Pringles and what our balance sheet is, I'd rather not go into that level of detail.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess I have a detailed question, and then I have a question for Todd. The detailed question is, just coming back to the guidance. So I guess in a nutshell, the tax rate that\u2019s now 29% for the full year means your second half tax rate is what you anticipated it was going to be when you originally gave guidance earlier this year. It's just part of those Pringles net cost and benefits included a tax element that we weren't counting on before. Is that a fair characterization?","Ronald L. Dissinger","That's exactly right. That's right, Jonathan. That's exactly the way to think about it.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","As a question for Todd, you've had such success with the Snack program, and I think, yes, even going back to the Keebler acquisition and look at how you've executed against innovations there. What is the -- what were the costs and benefits be, like why is the decision not being made to integrate Pringles into that DSD network? And is that something that's potential for the future? And what I'm -- I guess, what are the aspects of that business versus the rest of your Snack business that make that the appropriate decision?  I mean, could that change?","Todd Penegor","Good question, Jonathan. We have a very efficient distribution model already in place for Pringles. So the key is for us to continue to drive that efficiency to get it to the back of the store. The opportunity then is how do we leverage all of our great in-store presence to drive incremental merchandising, like bundling some of our bigger programs to make it even better. And you\u2019re already seeing examples of that right now with the back-to-school program. And you saw the picture in the deck with the Pringles being integrated into our school bus program. So we're getting it up on display and leveraging the in-store sales force.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Leveraging the in-store but not the actual delivery component, is that right?","Todd Penegor","That's right. And we don't have an intention to actually change the way we get it to the back of the store.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Does that limit -- I mean, let me ask it this way. I mean, what -- does that limit -- does Pringles have more points of distribution in North America right now or Keebler? I mean, are you limiting Pringles distribution by doing that? Or is there -- is Pringles' footprint the same size and it's just there's no point in integrating the 2?","Todd Penegor","A similar footprint. I think the biggest opportunity that we see is Pringles acts a lot like Cheez-It, when you look at lift-top display. And what we want to do is just continue to drive the display element of it. It's got a different shelf life, so we've got more opportunity to grab inventory to pull from the back of the store and get it up into our bigger and better and integrated promotions going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So what other key regions and products that you will expect to see the biggest relative change in the brand building? Because you said it's going to build. Can you just talk about which regions and which products? And then secondly, are you surprised, given the significantly higher brand building, that volume in Latin America kind of fell 1.5%? If you could touch on those 2 points, that would be great.","John A. Bryant","Yes. If you look at the brand building investment in the back half of the year, it's going to go disproportionately against where we believe our longer-term growth is in the company. So Asia Pacific and Latin America are going to receive more brand building in the back half of the year. We have very exciting long-term growth plans there. And then to your question on Latin America specifically, I think we do have an opportunity to improve our volume performance in Latin America over time. In the second quarter, and even a little bit in the third quarter, you will see some trade inventory coming out of the Latin American business as we work down those inventories that did have a little bit of an impact on the Q2 volume performance.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And which products within Asia and Latin America do you expect to be spending the most behind? Is it certain brands or product categories?","John A. Bryant","Primarily cereal, as well as probably starting to open up the brand building on Pringles over time as well. I think one of our challenges or opportunities on Pringles is just to get additional capacity on line. We have a lot of growth potential, and as Todd said, we have a very excited U.S. Snack organization. One of our challenges is to open up more capacity so we can drive that business even harder.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just want to ask a few questions, John, about the Pringles. And just to understand the degree or the extent which you can sort reinvest back in that business now. I think as I understand, you have a pretty tight capacity for that business. I think you've got to bring on some more capacity. And then I also want to understand, in relation to that, again, kind of the investments you can make back into the business to achieve revenue synergies, whether it's selling the product in Mexico or it's selling more Kellogg products on the platform in Asia? It's a bit of a wide-range question, but can you give a better sense of when you can start to expect heavier investment in Pringles?","John A. Bryant","Well, I think we do have an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in Pringles. Day one, as Todd mentioned in the U.S., we are bolting on the Pringles to the in-store execution within our U.S. business. And so we're seeing some early response from that. And to enable us to supply those initiatives, we're going back","[Audio Gap]","our facilities and challenging the mix and challenging the opportunity to get more volume out of the current network. Going forward, though, we need to add to that network, and it's going to take us a year or so to get that capacity on line so we can really drive the business even harder.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about Latin America because it's clearly your main driver of growth internationally. I know the focus has been on Mexico historically. Your main competitor is about to close a pretty meaningful snacking acquisition in Brazil, and I just wanted to ask about your strategy for Brazil. Is Pringles going to give enough of a platform to start to roll out snacks products there? Or are there other alternatives that you will consider to get bigger in that market? Or is the focus going to continue to be Mexico?","John A. Bryant","Alexia, if you look forward over the next 10 years, we'd like to see more balanced profile for Latin America. We continue to have growth opportunities in Mexico, but we believe we have even stronger growth opportunities in the Southern Cone and in Brazil, in particular. We are the category leader in Brazil, and the category is growing strong double-digits, as are we. And we are actually investing more in Brazil this year. In fact, we will probably see more of that come through in the back half of the year. And we also believe that Pringles represents a long-term opportunity in Brazil as well.","Simon Burton","Okay, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. I'm joined here by John Bryant, President and CEO; and Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer. The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, February 10. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","Now I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. As you have seen, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2013 results today. Full year reported sales growth was in line with our previous expectations. Internal growth was a little lower than we thought, driven by the cereal category weakness in developed markets that was seen for much of the year. Better-than-expected results below the line offset this impact, and full year comparable earnings were $3.77 per share, in line with our expectations. And cash flow was $1,170,000,000 for the full year, toward the high end of our range.","We've been making very good progress throughout the quarter on Project K, our significant multiyear efficiency and effectiveness program. I'll give you some more detail on this in a minute, but I'll say that I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far, and I am encouraged by the plans we have in place.","And finally, we also provided guidance for 2014 today. This guidance reflects the realities of our categories and the work required to drive growth in the future. While Project K is just part of the solution, it is important as it will provide fuel for growth over the next 4 years. We will not only invest Project K's savings back into the business, but we'll also look to improve the effectiveness of our existing investment. Our goals for 2014 are to set realistic targets and to invest back into our categories and our brands. We've got a lot of work to do, but we also see a lot of opportunity. You'll hear more on this later today and at CAGNY as we turn Kellogg to profitable growth over time.","And now if you'll turn to Slide 4, you'll see an update on Pringles. Pringles posted high-single-digit internal net sales growth for the full year and double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada and Specialty Channels in the U.S. all posted double-digit growth in the quarter as innovation and core products drove results. As we've mentioned before, the integration has gone very smoothly, is on track and is largely complete. This has been a great acquisition for us. Sales and profit growth had exceeded our expectations in every quarter since the transaction closed. The integration has transformed our global snack business and significantly increased its growth potential. We now have category teams based in each of our regions to drive future growth.","We launched some exciting innovation in 2013, including Tortilla Pringles in the U.S. late in the year. We've been capacity-constrained since completing the acquisition, but we have more capacity coming online in 2014 in Europe and in 2015 in Asia, which will help us manufacture closer to demand and supply future growth. In addition, we also recently announced that we are planning to add capacity for Pringles in China with our joint venture partner, Wilmar. Sales growth in China has been good. The JV has been going well. This is an exciting step for us in this important region.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 and a quick update on Project K. We've made quite a few announcements over the last few months. We expect that more than half of the cost savings we will realize over the next 4 years will come from supply chain, and that's certainly been the initial area of focus for us. One of our goals is to optimize our supply chain network. And as a result, we've announced plans to close or reduce capacity in plants in large, developed markets such as the U.S., Canada and Australia. Also, we're continuing to focus on emerging markets, which is an important part of our corporate strategy. So we're increasing the snacks capacity at our plant in Thailand, and as we've already mentioned, we're also adding cereal capacity in India and capacity for Pringles in Malaysia and in Poland. To be clear, this is capacity we're adding to service international demand. It's not product that will be shipped to North America. In addition, we're also making good progress with our move to global business services. So we've got a lot underway, and we'll provide further update at CAGNY in a few weeks.","The primary goal of Project K is to enable us to invest behind the business, and Slide 6 shows a framework which highlights the various areas of this reinvestment. We think of the purchase model in 3 distinct phases: Desire, Decide and Delight. The first of these, Desire, is the area of investment we normally associate with our advertising investment. Decide is about winning in store and includes engaging consumers at the shelf, packaging, assortment and in-store merchandising. And Delight really closes the loop. This is about the consumer experience, and it's largely about our product offering and quality. Project K has been investing back into all 3 of these areas.","So first, let me give you some examples in Desire. We will invest back behind our brands and specifically, to address some of the category issues we see today. This is not about more money behind the existing work. It's about better allocating investment and adding additional resources as part of Project K behind an initiative design to re-stimulate category growth. We will do this by leveraging the strongest brand in the category worldwide, and that is the Kellogg brand itself.","Over the last 6 months, we've been working to create a calendar of initiatives, including a campaign to reinforce the values of cereal and the role Kellogg plays in bringing that to the consumer. We'll be initiating campaigns in our core markets by the second quarter under the idea of Kellogg's cereal breakfast. We are excited by these ideas and the work we've seen so far.","The next step is Decide, which is the conversion of the shopper in the store. This includes investment in things like packaging, shopper programs, mobile, in-store ads and display. We currently have brands that respond well to display and in-store theater, and we're working to improve our vehicles for better presentation to the shopper. We have some industry-leading in-store partnerships with ESPN GameDay, the Olympics and key movie properties. In addition, as part of Project K, we're increasing our investment in our coverage model for DSD in our U.S. Snacks business, including investing in better technology for our reps.","And finally, we will also invest back in our food to delight consumers. There are various ways we can do this. We realize the ground continues to shift rapidly in consumer sentiment around nutrition and the values being placed on food. So we will continue to develop new foods to address these evolving consumer requirements like Raisin Bran with Omega-3 and Special K Nourish with quinoa. We will constantly strive to maintain and improve the quality of our products. We'll do more with our packaging, and we'll develop new ideas like our new granola in resealable bags.","So as you can see the scope and scale of our whole path-to-purchase model and that we have an opportunity to drive significant growth through further investment in all these areas. I recognize that because we are planning to invest in advertising, in-store execution and in the design and quality of our food, it'll be more difficult for you to track the investment. However, each of these areas will help drive future returns and are the right places for us to focus. Again, we'll come back at CAGNY with more detail regarding what we're doing.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a review of our quarterly and full year financial results.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 7 shows our performance for the quarter and the full year and excludes charges related to Project K and mark-to-market for pensions and commodities. Internal net sales for the full year increased by 0.3%. We delivered solid sales growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific in the quarter and for the full year. But sales declined in our 2 key U.S. businesses, impacting both quarterly and full year revenue growth.","Underlying internal operating profit increased by 1.3% for the full year and increased by 8.8% in the fourth quarter. The strong quarterly result was largely due to net deflation in cost of goods sold, the timing of brand-building as we were lapping significant growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and a lower year over -- impact from our base upfront cost, excluding Project K. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, marked-to-market adjustments and Project K costs, were $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter and $3.77 per share for the full year, in line with our expectations. The comparable results in the quarter benefited from a lower tax rate due to some discrete items that concluded late in the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per share for the full year were $4.94. This included a substantial benefit from the mark-to-market accounting for pensions due to both asset returns and movements and interest rates. This was partially offset by $0.13 of Pringles integration costs and $0.42 of costs related to Project K.","Slide 8 shows the components of the full year and quarterly sales growth. For the full year, reported sales increased by 4.2% and internal sales growth was 0.3%. For the fourth quarter, reported net sales declined by 1.7% and internal net sales declined by 0.9% on top of a 5% comp. This was primarily due to the weakness in the U.S. cereal and snacks businesses I mentioned earlier. Internal volume declined by 0.5 point for the full year and 1.6% in the fourth quarter. While we experienced softer volume in some developed cereal markets and in U.S. Snacks, we saw strong volume growth in snacks outside the U.S. and in our U.S. Frozen Foods business. We also posted improvements in price\/mix in both the quarter and for the full year. And of course, Pringles is most of the 4.6% full year growth from acquisitions. The impact of currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.7% for the full year and by 0.8% in the fourth quarter.","Slide 9 shows our gross margin performance during 2013. As we expected, we saw good margin improvement of 60 basis points in the quarter. As we've discussed earlier in the year, our productivity savings built throughout the year and savings in the fourth quarter were approximately 5% of cost of goods. And we also saw a moderation in gross inflation to approximately 4% in the fourth quarter. So we experienced net deflation and benefited from the timing of upfront costs. We did see some offset from reduced operating leverage due to the sales softness in our U.S. categories. Full year gross margin declined by slightly more than 1%, approximately in line with our expectations. Net cost of goods inflation of approximately 1 point and lower operating leverage were key drivers of our performance, resulting in around 70 basis points of decline on a comparable basis. The full year impact of the inclusion of the Pringles business in the results was a decline of around 40 basis points.","Slide 10 shows the operating profit performance for each of the regions in the fourth quarter. The operating profit growth on the chart excludes charges for Project K. As I mentioned earlier, underlying internal operating profit for the total company increased by 8.8%. North America's underlying internal operating profit decreased by 2.9%, and this was primarily driven by sales declines in Morning Foods, Snacks in Canada. Underlying internal operating profit increased by 15.3% in Europe. This was the result of good sales growth and the impact of comparisons. Underlying internal operating profit in Latin America decreased by 4.7%. While we recognized solid sales growth in the region, we experienced some disruption to our product supply due to the difficult operating environment in Venezuela. This resulted in higher cost of goods sold and reduced operating leverage. And in Asia-Pacific, we saw a significant increase in underlying internal operating profit due to solid sales growth and a significant investment in upfront cost in the region in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Now let's turn to Slide 11, which shows our cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations before capital spending was $1,807,000,000 for the full year, in line with our expectations. This was an increase of $49 million over 2012, and remember, 2012 included a onetime benefit of approximately $150 million from the Pringles acquisition. So we're pleased with our cash flow generation in 2013, which was towards the high end of our guidance range.","Capital spending for 2013 was $637 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately $104 million. This was slightly more than 4% of sales. And you'll recall that we were expecting capital spending this year to be greater than the high end of our long-term target range as we invest in additional capital for Pringles and the new plant in India and because of some shift of investment we saw from late 2012 into 2013.","We purchased $544 million of shares in 2013. We do expect to go back to our normal share repurchase activity in 2014, and it will reduce the overall average share count by between 1.5% and 2%.","And finally, we have made progress on reducing debt levels since the acquisition of Pringles. In fact, we've decreased our levels of debt by approximately $900 million over the last 18 months.","Slide 12 details our guidance for 2014. We're giving pragmatic guidance for growth for the full year. Project K will provide some funding to increase investment in certain businesses and categories in which we compete. We expect that internal net sales will be up approximately 1% in 2014. This excludes any impact from integration costs, the impact of currency translation and this year's 53rd week. The 53rd week should add a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth. We continue to expect moderate material-related inflation in 2014. Total cost of goods inflation is estimated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. This is before the benefit from productivity, which we estimate to be toward the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 4% of cost of goods. In addition, we will recognize some savings from Project K in cost of goods sold.","So we expect a moderate amount of net deflation overall. As a result, we anticipate that underlying reported gross margin will increase by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, including the benefit we'll realize from Project K impacting our supply chain.","Underlying internal operating profit is estimated to be flat to up 2%. We expect that brand-building will increase faster than sales growth, including the reinvestment of savings from Project K. We also have a little more than 1 point of headwind from incentive compensation due to our performance in 2013. And we're planning for some impact from the new food tax in Mexico and a more difficult regulatory environment in the Latin America region.","Finally, on operating profit. The 53rd week should add approximately 1.5 to 2 points to reported operating profit growth for the year. We expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will increase at a rate between 1% and 3% in 2014. The underlying tax rate is estimated to be between 29% and 30%, and interest expense will be between $225 million and $235 million.","Our reported EPS was $4.94, including the impact of mark-to-market in 2013, and there's a walk in the appendix that shows all the components of our results.","Slide 13 shows our EPS walk for 2014. First, we have adjusted our 2013 base earnings per share to remove the upfront costs of $0.08 per share incurred in 2013. While we will continue to invest in productivity initiatives, we are bundling all of our upfront costs into Project K for simplicity's sake, and we'll exclude them from our underlying results. Earnings per share growth of 1% to 3% puts us in a range of $3.89 to $3.97 a share. We currently estimate that currency translation will not have an impact on results. Although it's important to note that this doesn't include the impact of any significant currency devaluations we might see during the year, for example, Venezuela. In addition, we estimate that the 53rd week will add approximately $0.08 per share. We expect 1 more year of costs related to the integration of Pringles, and we estimate between $0.07 and $0.09 per share in 2014, primarily related to our go-to-market model. This puts us more toward the high end of our original estimate for integration cost, but synergies have exceeded the high end of our $50 million to $75 million range, too. And we're expecting incremental savings from Project K will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the full year, approximately 40% of which will come from cost of goods. As John said, it is our intention to reinvest these savings in growth initiatives. Costs related to the project are estimated to be approximately $300 million to $350 million or $0.60 to $0.65 per share in 2014, with approximately 1\/2 in cost of goods sold. But I should point out that we could see initiatives shift between years as we progress through the project, and obviously, we'll update you if this occurs.","Our estimate is that total pretax costs over the life of the project will be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, and our estimate is that annual savings will be between $425 million and $475 million by 2018. Both of these estimates are unchanged from our initial guidance last quarter.","We expect the cash flow in 2014 will be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. This includes capital spending and additional cash required by Project K. This will be partially offset by an initiative in accounts payable to reduce our working capital. This is already underway.","We anticipate that total capital spending will be in the range of 4% to 5% of sales, as we mentioned last quarter, and this will include investment in Project K and the additional capacity for Pringles.","Last, a few comments on the first quarter of 2014. We expect that the sales trends we've seen in several of our businesses in 2013 will continue into 2014, and first quarter sales could be down slightly. We also expect that underlying gross margin in the first quarter will be flat to down slightly, driven by operating leverage and the timing of our productivity savings during the year. This will lead to lower underlying operating profit and comparable earnings per share, including currency, in the range of $0.95 to $0.98 per share. Of course, our guidance on operating profit and earnings per share excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, integration costs and Project K costs.","And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail on the operating segments.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Now let's look at Slide 15 and some more detail regarding Morning Foods. Sales declined by 4% in the fourth quarter, although we're lapping mid-single-digit growth, the most difficult comparison of the year. Consumption in the cereal category remained lower than we had initially expected as merchandising and display were down. The adult segment of the portfolio remained weak, and we saw lower year-over-year retail inventories, which had an effect on shipments in the quarter. We saw some good growth in parts of our portfolio. For example, Raisin Bran grew strongly, driven by innovation and advertising as part of our healthy dividends campaign. This program is aimed at baby boomers and highlights the health benefits of our products. It's a campaign that has resonated with consumers and is an example of the type of activity that we'll be doing more of in the future. We've got more activity planned in 2014, including new product introductions such as the new Special K Chocolate Almond, the Krave cereal, Touch of Fruit Mini-Wheats, Bear Naked granola and new Kashi cereals, including 3 varieties of Organic Promise, all of which are GMO-free.","You'll see on Slide 16 that we're very happy to be celebrating Pop-Tarts' 50th anniversary in 2014. This is an iconic brand that has just completed its 31st consecutive year of growth. Core and new products continue to drive this, and the brand feels as young today as it ever has. Pop-Tarts gained 0.6 point share over the last 52-week period on consumption growth of 3.4%, and full year category share was 84.4%. The 2 Peanut Butter Pop-Tarts we launched in 2013 continued to do well in the fourth quarter and also contributed to full year results. We have bigger commercial plans coming in 2014 as part of the Olympics program and the Crazy Good summer campaign.","And in some of the other categories in Morning Foods, we're following up last year's launch of our drinkable breakfast products with new Coffee House versions. These new flavors include chocolate mocha and vanilla cappuccino, and will make a great addition to our existing lineup. In addition, the new Special K Hot Cereals we launched last year have also been doing well.","Finally, for Morning Foods, we have a number of exciting commercial plans scheduled for 2014. These include the Olympics sponsorship I mentioned, which is underway now, a Share Your Breakfast program in March and Kellogg masterbrand category-building programs to come later in the year. Some of these, particularly the ones later in the year, will be part of the reinvestment program related to Project K. We expect that these category-related activities will improve the relevancy of the cereal category progressively over time.","Now let's turn to Slide 17 and our U.S. Snacks segment. Both shipments and consumption increased in the cracker business in the fourth quarter, and share remained essentially flat. We had strong merchandising during the holiday season, and Town House Pita and Cheez-It Zings, both of which were midyear innovations, continued to do well. Consumption of Town House crackers increased significantly due to both the innovation and share gains posted by the original variety. Cheez-It Zings also contributed incremental growth as base Cheez-Its also grew. Partially offsetting this growth were some weakness in the Special K Cracker business, as well as strong comparisons in the second half of 2012. We have some good innovation coming in this category in 2014. We have just launched Cheez-It Grooves, which is off to a good start, as is the cracker business as a whole.","The Keebler brand, in total, posted slight internal net sales growth due to good results from Fudge Shoppe in the fourth quarter. And we have some exciting new product news coming later in the first quarter on Chips Deluxe. However, the cookie business as a whole declined in the fourth quarter. This was partially driven by reductions in inventory, although we saw weakness in some of our brands, including Mother's and Murray Sugar Free.","In the wholesome snacks business, Nutri-Grain, again, gained share in the quarter, driven by Nutri-Grain Crunch, and we also saw good performance from Rice Krispies Treats. However, this growth was more than offset by weakness in other parts of the portfolio and lower inventories at retail. So we saw growth in the wholesome snack business, where we've innovated, but frankly, we've been disappointed with the performance of this business. So we're changing direction and are planning innovation and advertising that returns the core in both Special K and Nutri-Grain brands. And with Kashi, much like we're doing in cereal, we're returning the brand to its roots. So we're taking the right steps to drive improvement over time.","Finally, for snacks. Our Pringles business posted strong double-digit internal net sales growth as a result of good consumption and the shipment of the new Tortilla innovation I mentioned earlier. Pringles had a very strong year in 2013 despite some difficult comparisons, and we remain optimistic given the early results from the launch of new products and a strong commercial calendar. While we don't expect continued double-digit growth, we are excited by the potential growth of this great business.","So in summary, the snacks business had a difficult year in 2013, and 2014 will be a rebuilding year as we continue to focus on what's working and also on investment and innovation and better in-store execution. We recognize that we've got a lot to do in this business, and the team has been working hard on their plan.","Now let's turn to Slide 18 and the strong performance of the U.S. Specialty segment. Internal net sales growth was 5.1% in the fourth quarter and was 4.1% for the full year. In the 12-week consumption data, Kellogg gained share in the Convenience channel in the cereal, cracker and health and wellness categories. Innovation, distribution and pricing drove good internal sales growth in the fourth quarter and strong double-digit growth for the full year in the channel. Our Cereal in a Cup products have continued to perform well in this channel, as have breakfast shakes and our new launches in the cereal bar segment. Pringles also did well in the quarter and posted double-digit internal sales growth and share gains for the full year.","In Foodservice, we renovated a significant number of SKUs in the K-12 schools business, where we posted double-digit sales growth as a result. In fact, the overall Foodservice business outperformed the soft category to impart the good results from the Eggo brand.","Now let's turn to Slide 19, which shows detail regarding the North America Other segment. This segment, which includes the Canadian and U.S. Frozen Foods business, posted an internal sales decrease of 2.9% in the quarter against a double-digit growth comparison. In the fourth quarter, internal net sales in Frozen Foods business increased at a low-single-digit rate as we were lapping the most difficult comparisons of the year. You'll remember that we launched Special K flatbread sandwiches in the second half of last year, which contributed to the very strong double-digit sales growth we posted in both the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Our core Eggo business did well in the fourth quarter of 2013 as both the kid and family segments posted good rates of growth and we drove new brand-building activities. Special K flatbread sandwiches benefited from the launch of a new Deluxe Egg and Cheese version in the second half, which also contributed. A new bacon variety is going into the market now, and we expect that this and last year's innovation will both contribute to results in 2014. We also saw double-digit growth in the burger segment of our Morningstar Farms portfolio and momentum in the poultry segment, driven by new product introductions in the middle of the year. It's worth noting that we will take some SKUs out of the Kashi Frozen Foods portfolio in 2014, which will have an adverse impact on sales growth. And our Canadian business ended the full year with a decline in internal sales of less than 1%. This was partially due to comps later in the year, but we also saw weakness in the cereal category throughout most of the year, much like in the U.S.","Now let's turn to Slide 20 and our international businesses. All of our international regions posted internal sales growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year. The European business posted good results in the fourth quarter, with internal sales growth of 1.2% and double-digit operating profit growth. Internal sales growth for the full year was 1.7%. Pringles continued to post good results in the fourth quarter as it has full year. Broader competitive conditions in both the U.K. and on the continent remain challenging. The cereal category in the U.K. continued to be difficult, although our new Crunchy Nut Granola contributed to sales, and Crunchy Nut, Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes all gained share. Special K will remain a focus for us in 2014 in the U.K., and we have both new commercial plans and the introduction of Special K granola coming during the year.","The Pringles business in the U.K. gained 1.7 points of share as commercial pressure, good in-store execution and strong commercial plans all contributed. We posted mid-single-digit growth in our European emerging markets, which include the Middle East and Russia, and we are pleased with the results in these developing growth regions. However, Southern Europe remains challenging.","So we had encouraging results in Europe in 2013. We saw good rates of growth in various businesses, and Pringles was a significant contributor. And we achieved the top and bottom line growth we expected. We have some good innovation and commercial plans coming, and we expect to post top and bottom line growth again this year. However, the environment in the region remains very difficult, and we believe we have pragmatic expectations for the business in 2014.","Slide 21 shows this year's performance in the Latin American region. Internal net sales growth was 3% in the fourth quarter against a 9% comparison in the fourth quarter of last year. The cereal category in Mexico has slowed somewhat, particularly in the adult-oriented segment of the portfolio. Despite this, Kellogg gained 0.7 point share in the most recent quarter of consumption data. The snack categories saw declines in consumption in the latest data, but Kellogg, again, gained 2 points of share as a result of our mid-single-digit rate of sales growth. Also in the region, we saw good results in Brazil and in the Pringles business, which posted high-single-digit internal sales growth. Economic conditions continue to be difficult in Mexico, and the recently imposed tax on food and beverages could have a significant effect on sales in several key categories. Consumers are faced with a double-digit price increase on January 1. We expect that we will see more of an adverse impact in the first half of the year as consumers adjust to the new prices. And while we believe the team is planning appropriately, this and the continuing uncertainty in Venezuela will limit sales growth in 2014.","And finally, on Slide 22, is detail on the Asia-Pacific business. This segment posted internal sales growth of 4% in the fourth quarter and full year growth of 3%. The Japanese, South Korean, Indian, Southeast Asian and Pringles businesses all posted strong rates of growth in the quarter. In fact, the Asian business saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Granola has continued to do well in Japan. Pringles gained share in many countries. And both Special K Cracker Chips and Biscuit Moments, both examples of innovation that has traveled from other regions, have done well in Australia. The cereal category in Australia saw declines in consumption in the fourth quarter. We believe the category-building activity will also help to drive this business, and we are currently formulating plans that we believe will begin to address this issue. However, we remain cautious on cereal in Australia as we go into 2014.","And now I'll open up for questions before coming back with a brief summary.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","John, you talked about your plans to invest in Desire, Decide, Delight. Where do you think is the biggest gap right now? Where's the biggest opportunity to really move the business? And what kind of steps are the most promising to tackle that?","John A. Bryant","Thilo, there's a couple ways of thinking about that question, and I think the answer depends a little bit by business. So if we look at the cereal business, particularly in some of the large developed markets, I think it's primarily a Desire opportunity, a category relevance opportunity. And so you'll see us investing back more in our developed cereal business, in category-building activities, category-relevance activities in markets like the U.S., U.K., Australia and Canada. We'll also selectively invest back in Delight. There is some food investment opportunities there as well. If I go to the snacks business in the U.S., I think the opportunity in snacks is more in the Decide phase. It's more about in-store execution. And so what you're seeing us do there is invest back into our U.S. sales organization, invest back into the DSD system, specifically, and reduce the number of stores per route, so our people can spend more time in store and execute more effectively.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So on cereal, you're still not of the view that cereal in the U.S. is a structurally broken category?","John A. Bryant","No, absolutely not. If I step back and talk about the cereal category for a minute, and I'll use the U.S. as an example, the breakfast occasion in the U.S. is actually still growing. If you look at the range of food items consumed at breakfast in the U.S. in the home, it's actually up about 3% through the back part of last year. And in that context, cereal is the #1 item consumed at breakfast and has a very high household penetration. When we look at what's happening within cereal, we're losing people to other categories such as eggs, toast, peanut butter, yogurt, et cetera. We're not losing people to any one category in particular. And when we ask people why they're leaving, there's no one negative item, and in fact, there's no real negative item. In fact, when we talk to consumers about why they're eating less cereal, we call it an unconscious migration because the answer we get is generally \"I didn't realize I was eating less cereal in the week.\" So as we think about what we need to do on cereal, is we need to tell our story more effectively about the benefits of eating cereal for breakfast. One way to think about that is to move our model from a focus on winning in the cereal category, brand versus brand within cereal, to winning with cereal at the breakfast occasion and looking at the benefits and communicating the benefits of cereals to the consumers relative to some of the other alternatives at the broader breakfast occasion. And while the challenge for us to do that is to do that in a way that we own the outcome, we own the growth in the category. And we think we can do that by activating the strongest brand we have, which is the Kellogg brand. And to put that into context, Kellogg is the #1 food CPG brand as ranked by Interbrand. So we have strong insights and messaging around the benefits of cereal using the Kellogg masterbrand, and you'll see more of that category-building activity as we go through the middle of this year in some of these major cereal markets. And we believe we can absolutely win with cereal at the breakfast occasion.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- I've got 2 questions. The first one is on your inflation guidance. Can you guys just talk about -- I think you said gross inflation up 3% to 4%, and I believe that would build on top of the 5% in 2013. Can you just discuss the key factors that are impacting gross inflation for Kellogg? And then I have a follow-up question I'd like to ask on snack bars.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, David. On the gross inflation, so we're seeing inflation across a number of components of our cost of goods structure. First, we are seeing deflation in some of the key grades that you can see on the exchanges. But probably 80% of our material cost base, we're still seeing inflation. Things like packaging and energy are inflating significantly. That's having an impact on our cost structure. In addition to that, we've got increases in some of our factory investment and wages as well. So when you wrap it all up, we're still seeing around 3% to 4% of cost inflation. But remember, I said overall, we are expecting to see net deflation because of our strong productivity improvement programs and as well as some of the savings we get off Project K.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then on the snack bars, John, the Nielsen data on snack bars looks pretty bad. I mean, sometimes, I see down mid-teens on snack bars. Number one, is it -- it's a grain-based product. Is it related to the issues in cereal? Is it related to a lack of focus on granola? Is it just you're zigging when you should have zagged or something like that? Why such extraordinarily kind of negative results in a category that still looks like a good category?","John A. Bryant","David, I think we still believe the wholesome snacks business is absolutely a good category to be in. To be frank, we're disappointed by the performance of our wholesome snacks business. If we peel the onion back, Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats actually are still doing reasonably well in the category. We have some weakness specifically around Special K and FiberPlus. As I said in the prepared remarks, we need to focus back on the core within these wholesome snacks. And as we look at 2014, we expect this business to continue to be a challenge. But I think a big part for us to win in this business, strong innovation, brand building and in-store execution, and particularly the area of in-store execution, where I think we have an opportunity to reinvest back within our DSD organization and improve the execution in store over time. So we have a good core business. We probably had some innovation in that business that hasn't stuck in the marketplace. It's a bit of a drag on us, and we need to focus back on the core, improve some of the core food and improve the in-store execution as well.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And John, just comment, though, on the interaction, though, between the snack bar problems and the cereal problems. I mean, a lot of people ask me about carbohydrates. What's your opinion here on the issues, whether they are related?","John A. Bryant","I believe the wholesome snacks business, which we position largely as breakfast on the go, is still a category that can continue to grow as it meets the needs of consumers, more portable breakfast solutions. So I think that one has a good category opportunity. I think with cereal, we just have a lot of different alternatives to that breakfast occasion. And if you look at our share of voice, it's probably been declining over time at a category level relative to some of that competition. And we have an opportunity to sharpen our messaging, to increase our investment a little bit and drive the relevance of the cereal category back. So I see them as 2 distinct discussions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As we look at the measured channel data for the cereal category, I understand you're investing across the breakfast opportunity, trying to increase relevance. One of the things that I still find a little concerning is just the weakness. In a way, it seems to be concentrated in some of the core franchises, in some of the more enduring brands within your portfolio, like Special K, like Mini-Wheats. So on those brands, in particular, are there specific issues of merchandising or innovation timing? Have you held back ahead of the Olympics activity, or are you seeing anything -- any sort of broader pressure on those brands? And just on Special K, in particular, also if you could address the protein line extension and sort of whether that's proven to be incremental or not to the overall brand.","John A. Bryant","Thank you, Matthew. So I think if you look at brands like Mini-Wheats, you're actually seeing that brand strengthen over time. And if you look at brands like Raisin Bran, you're actually seeing good growth when we get behind a healthy dividends-type messaging. So when we have clear insights, good messaging, we can absolutely drive these businesses. And I think if you're looking within some of the more recent consumption data, say, some of the published data in January, I think you are seeing some timing of activity between our Olympics activity, which is more February, and our Share Your Breakfast activity, which is March as opposed to January. What I will say in January, on Special K, specifically, is we did not have as strong a resolution event as we would have hoped. And that is some short-term softness in Special K as a result in January. There is a broader macro trend against some of these weight management-type propositions, not just Special K in cereal but some other similar propositions in other categories. And there is some general softness in that. Special K remains a very strong brand. I think we need to re-amp the messaging and find another angle in with the consumers. We have some work to do on Special K in general. I think that is part of the weakness we're seeing in the category, not just in the U.S. but some of the other developed markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question about cereal again. Did you consider, John, making a deeper investment this year to try to rebound, to help the category rebound? When I look at how much you're actually spending incrementally, it really isn't that much. It sounds like it's more a shift in resources to more umbrella advertising for the Kellogg brand, a masterbrand strategy. Is that going to be enough? Did you consider making a bigger investment? And then secondly, on masterbrand advertising, I've seen the attitude towards that kind of wax and wane in consumer packaged foods. Campbell tried it and then shifted right back again. What makes you think that masterbrand can really work this time?","John A. Bryant","Well, Robert, we have not really activated Kellogg for a very long period of time. It's a very strong brand, so we're very confident that that brand has the capability of engaging consumers back into the category in a way that we can uniquely own. At the same time, being pragmatic, we haven't had these programs in market yet. So your question about whether we would double or triple down on the investment, I think we want to see it work before we drive a large amount of investment into it. And it's worth remembering to your point that while we are adding more brand building, we spend $1.5 billion a year in brand building. We have a lot of brand-building fuel in the engine. And if we find these programs really drive the business, we'll probably reorient money we already have as opposed to have to add a whole new money into the category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm interested in the thinking behind excluding upfront costs. Kellogg used to openly pride itself on keeping these costs in. They were a normal part of doing business. But now this thinking has been reversed, and I'm not sure why other than to, frankly, optically drive EPS higher. So my question is this. If these are ongoing costs, and they happen every year, and they've been similar in EPS impact most years, why should we exclude them? What's different about these upfront costs than the investments every food company does each quarter?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Ken, as you saw within the information that we shared on our guidance, we clearly stated the amount of upfront cost change in 2013 and added that back before we grew the 1% to 3% in terms of our guidance. We think it's simpler rather than trying to dissect our investments in upfront costs between base upfront cost and Project K. We think it's simpler and cleaner to just bundle everything together over the life of Project K and exclude them from our underlying results. So there's really nothing more than that. We do still have a small element of base upfront costs that we're including in our total project investment so that we can drive additional productivity investments and savings in the 3% to 4% base productivity that we strive to achieve each year.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, when you speak to the investment in your DSD system going forward and, I guess, some of the technologies there, are there certain competitive deficiencies that you've noticed in terms of technology execution? Is it part of the normal replacement cycle? Just any thoughts there in terms of your observations on DSD, either on isolation or versus your competitors.","John A. Bryant","John, as we look at that DSD business, we think we have the ability to be more effective by providing them with new tools. So we have new iPad-type based programs, applications to help them be more effective in store. In addition to that we are reducing the coverage rates, so we're going from -- each route being about 18 stores down to 12 stores, pretty meaningful move there. In terms of our competitive position, we have, quite frankly, the model is split [indiscernible] has occurred. That large sales organization is focused on a much smaller part of business, and that has been a competitive headwind for us, and we are looking to ensure that we have the right resources in store to drive that business forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the last comment, John. As you reduce the -- or improve the coverage rate, I guess my question is -- inherently, it makes sense, but how do you do that in a, I guess, cost-effective way? Because obviously, just the overall scale, right, of your DSD business versus that of Mondelez, I would assume makes DSD system, a pretty fixed cost-intensive system, that much tougher to start with, let alone the scale differential. I'm trying to get a sense how you do that, or does that just hit margins for a period of time here or reset the margin base? And then secondly, I'm just curious, and this is probably better asked to others, do you get a feeling that other players or a player in the U.S. cereal category will also try and kind of activate or help restimulate the category as a whole as opposed to, again, just a specific kind of brand versus brand type of stuff? Just from what you may see in the industry.","John A. Bryant","Well, Andrew, first, on the snacks investment, the investment is actually not as large as it might sound. We spend a lot of money getting the product to the store, and then we just need to have a little bit more resources activating it, actually, in the store itself. So it's not a significant investment as it might sound in terms of reducing the store coverage, as I said earlier. It is, however, important for us to win in store to make sure that we have the resources in place to build the displays and to get the activation going. On cereal, we're focused on driving our business, which will drive the category. I believe the dynamics we're seeing in the cereal category holds true for us as it does for other manufacturers. And as we look over time, what drives this category is health and wellness, brand building, great food, and we're focused on driving the business in a sustainable way that will grow the category. I can't talk to how other manufacturers will react and what their plans will be, but I believe if you look back over time, this is a very consistent message in terms of what has driven the category historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just let me get on a soapbox for 1 second. I disagree with Ken. I think everybody else has been -- most companies, Hershey, others have been excluding tons of charges. And so I think it's perfectly reasonable for you, too. Ultimately, it's what the cash cost is, not what the earnings is. So I don't have a problem with that. But looking at your -- kind of where 2014, and I recognize that things are challenging and it's a transition year, but it sounds like the $0.08 of upfront and the $0.08 of the 53rd week, plus you're going to be doing more buybacks of 1.5%. So is net income actually down here for the year, x currency, assuming that still is neutral?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Let me walk you through our guidance, Eric. First of all, we said approximately 1 point in terms of our sales growth. So that's driving, call it, around $60 million worth of profit accretion. And then we also said we have a little bit of net deflation. It's a little less than 1 point, and that includes Project K savings. It's driving our gross margin expansion. That's probably $60 million or so, also of profit accretion. From there, we're investing back in brand building at a rate faster than sales and advertising, also at a rate faster than sales. And then John has been talking about investing in capability, the sales execution, the category teams that we've put in place and some investment in R&D as well. And we've got a little more than 1 point, as I said, on incentive compensation headwind. We are growing operating profit and net income relatively flat as a result of the share repurchase program. So when you move to earnings per share going from flat to up -- to an operating profit up 1% to up 3%, we're getting about 1.5 to 2 points accretion related to the share repurchase program. And then we do have a little bit of headwind from tax expense. We had a lower tax rate in 2013 versus what we're expecting in 2014. So we're basically getting about 1 point of accretion below operating profit really attributable to our share repurchase program.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on a more, I guess, just operations standpoint, can you remind me of, like, what is on the DSD truck in terms of your brands now? And is there any consideration of what's going to shift? I mean, obviously, Pop-Tarts is doing well on its own, and that hasn't been on the truck. But is there shifts in what you're going to put through warehouse versus what's on the truck as part of this efficiency move?","John A. Bryant","So Eric, we have 3 big businesses that go through the DSD system. There's crackers, cookies, wholesome snacks. We have a fourth segment, which is part of our snacks business, which is Pringles, which goes warehouse. To answer your question, we have no plans to change that dramatically. We have a tremendous DSD system. It's an incredible execution machine. It's great ability to drive the cookie, cracker and wholesome snacks business. We just need to invest a little bit back behind that system and ensure it's set up for success.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Varun Gokarn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Varun Gokarn in for Jason. My question is on cereal. You mentioned focused advertising that communicates the benefits of cereal as an overall category, but much of the recent market share weakness that your brand is seeing has to do with promotional intensity from your primary competitor, which, in a recent Nielsen data we're looking at, you're not currently matching. So when you talk about reinvestment, how do you balance the need for tactical pricing adjustment versus advertising on overall category and versus innovation?","John A. Bryant","I sit back and look at the cereal category. It's always an intensively competitive category. And I don't believe it's any more competitive today or any less than it has been historically. So I think the category is fundamentally rational. When you look at what drives this category, again, it's health and wellness, brand building, innovation, great food. It's not constantly driving down prices. Empirically, you go back to 1996 and 2010, when prices came down in the category, the category did not grow. So we are focused on driving our business the right way. We are and will remain competitive in the category, and what you see from time to time is the natural ebbs and flows of competitive activity. So for example, we have a little bit less activity out there in January relative to January last year, but we have a strong Olympics program in February. So I'm not sure what data specifically you're looking at, but be careful not to overreact to short-term movements in data from 1 month to the next in the category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So there's been some commentary about Millennials being less loyal to big, established brands than older consumers. I'm thinking specifically in snack bars. We're seeing the rise of some niche brands in there, which is a reversal of previous trends over the last several years. Does that make it harder for Kellogg to gain share over time, and would you consider acquiring some of those niche brands to bolster growth over time and shift the portfolio into a faster-growing product?","John A. Bryant","So Alexia, I think we would look at that from all angles. Firstly, if there is something that is interesting to acquire, as you've seen in the past, we have done that. I think also, as I said before, in the Desire, Decide, Delight continuum, we have an opportunity to invest some more money back in the Delight side, in other words, invest more money back into food. I think what you're seeing sometimes in Millennials is not so much lack of brand loyalty as they're looking for different food values, and some of the pre-existing businesses don't always meet their needs. And so within our portfolio, we need to have choice. We have some great brands in the portfolio that do lean towards those Millennials, and I think in those brands, we need to ensure the food really is meeting their requirements.","Operator","Your final question will come from Chris Growe from Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had a question for you, John, in relation to your revenue growth in 2014. I guess as a global comment, do you expect cereal sales to grow? Or maybe I'm just trying to get the balance between cereal and snacks growth in '14 and maybe how those investments could benefit the cereal category throughout the year.","John A. Bryant","We will have elements of cereal growth throughout the year. So as I said, for example, in Asia-Pacific, we're seeing some good growth outside of the market, like Australia. As we think about the big, developed supermarkets, which is where we have our challenges right now, I think for very similar, consistent reasons, we need to talk more about the nutritional benefits of cereal to our consumers in those markets. While I'm excited about the plans we have for 2014, as we set the guidance we've set, we're going to be pragmatic that I expect those categories and, quite frankly, ourselves in those categories, to be down year-on-year slightly, low single digits. And because those big, developed markets are such a big percentage of the cereal business, that means it's going to be a drag on our cereal sales in the year. Obviously, we're driving to have a better performance in U.S. Snacks in 2014. And we are having tremendous success with Pringles, which will continue to help drive our snacks business, as well as some of wholesome snacks offerings we have globally. So I do expect a better performance out of the snacks business and the cereal business in 2014. Long term, I'm very confident in the potential growth of the cereal category and our cereal business, but I think it's best to be pragmatic as we look in 2014 around that business specifically.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just to follow on that, as you talk about these investments in the category and reiterating the category -- the important aspects of the category to the consumer, is that happening now, or is that more about in the future as you get these savings coming through? Are you making the brand message to consumer now is my question.","John A. Bryant","It's really more Q2, Q3 of 2014. And that's not due to savings. That's just due to when the programs are ready and the best time to put them into the year given other calendar events. For example, the Olympics is sitting right in February. So we need separation between activation, so we don't submerge and confuse the message to consumers.","And now if I could take a moment to make some concluding remarks. First, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We faced a difficult environment in 2013 in developed regions, and we expect that this will continue in 2014. However, as I've highlighted today, we have plans to address this. In fact, over the last couple of years, we've made significant strides with our broader strategy, which hasn't changed, and the plans we've talked about today fit in well with this strategy. We improved our supply chain organization. We completed the successful acquisition of Pringles, which has exceeded our expectations and has provided us with a global snacks platform. We announced and started to implement Project K, a 4-year efficiency and effectiveness program and the largest in the company's history. And we're developing and investing in ideas that will drive growth in the future. We recognize the challenges that we have, and we're taking meaningful actions that will begin to address them. This will be a journey and will require a lot of work, so I'm sure that we're making the right decisions now to drive growth in the future. And as we continue this journey, I'd again like to say thank you to all the Kellogg employees around the world. They will make all the difference, and it's their hard work that will drive our success. Thank you.","Simon Burton","Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining today. We'll be available for follow-up as you need us. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for a review of our first quarter 2013 results. I'm joined by John Bryant, our President and CEO; Ron Dissinger, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Huff, President of our U.S. Specialty Channels business. We've been highlighting different business units over the last year, and Brian is here to discuss Specialty Channels in a little more detail. In addition, due to changes in how we account for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, we've provided additional detail in this presentation and in the earnings press release. The press release and slides to support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kellogcompany.com.","As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. So for further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, May 6, and the call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","With that, I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.","We're pleased to announce a good first quarter and start to the year. Reported sales growth was strong at 12%. Internal net sales growth was 2.2%, broadly in line with our expectations, and most of our businesses around the world posted solid underlying results so -- as we will discuss in more detail later.","Underlying operating profit growth was also broadly in line with expectations as we faced the highest level of inflation that we expect to see all year. We're on track for the full year, and as Ron said in his guidance at CAGNY, there were a few items that we anticipated would have an impact on the first quarter. First, we expect around $80 million of COGS inflation net of COGS savings in 2013, and we saw more than $80 million just in the first quarter. So this obviously had a significant impact.","Secondly, the devaluation in Venezuela also had a meaningful impact and was larger than we expected. And finally, the process of closing a manufacturing plant in Australia continued in the first quarter, which led to higher year-over-year costs. So we expect more balanced results as the year progresses.","Now let's turn to Slide 4 and a review of Pringles. We continue to see very strong performance from the business in the first quarter. In fact, organic sales growth of the total Pringles brand was approximately 7%. In all the regions around the world, Pringles continues to do well. And as we've mentioned before, the commercial programs we've implemented since the acquisition have been very well received by consumers.","In the U.S. and Canada, we relaunched Stix, which is off to a good start. In Europe, we saw good growth in much of the region, and we saw high single-digit underlying growth in the Asia Pacific business as well.","The integration continues to go well. We have converted Asia and Europe to our systems, and the transition went very smoothly. We are currently in the process of conversions -- converting in the Americas. We're on schedule to complete the integration over the next few months, and we remain confident that we'll recognize the synergies we expected for 2013.","And talent retention has also been very good. As you saw at CAGNY and our Investor Day, we now have former Pringles employees in very senior roles within the organization. And finally on Pringles, we'll have some new capacity coming online in 2014, which will add to the excellent work that's being done to improve the capacity in our existing facilities. So we're on track to achieve our full year guidance.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for more details.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.","First of all, I'd like to point out that our underlying results exclude the impact of mark-to-market adjustments. Underlying internal results exclude the impact of mark-to-market adjustment, acquisitions, divestitures, integration costs and the impact from foreign currency translation. We're also providing details of underlying earnings per share excluding integration costs again this quarter. Slide 5 shows the first quarter's financial results.","Reported sales growth was 12.2%. Internal sales growth was 2.2% and included growth across all 4 geographic regions of the world. Underlying reported operating profit decreased by 3.5%, including Pringles integration costs. Reported operating profit was flat excluding integration costs. Underlying internal operating profit decreased by 5.8%.","As we told you previously, the first quarter included most of our net cost inflation for the year, which is why we had expected that underlying internal operating profit would be down in the first quarter.","Underlying earnings per share excluding integration costs was $0.99, broadly in line with our expectations. This includes an impact of approximately $0.03 from the devaluation in Venezuela. So without the onetime impact of the devaluation, our underlying earnings per share would have been $1.02.","In addition, we were lapping a $0.05 benefit in the first quarter of last year that resulted from the interest rate hedges related to the Pringles acquisition. Overall, our results are in line with our expectations, and we remain on track for the year.","Slide 6 shows the composition of the first quarter sales growth. As I mentioned, reported sales growth was 12.2% and internal sales growth was 2.2%. Volume increased by 1.4 points in the quarter and was broad based. We grew volume in every region of the world. We also recognized price and mix improvements of 0.8 points of the quarter, and we expect a better balance of volume and price mix this year.","On a global basis, we grew both cereal and snacks. In addition, the U.S. frozen and specialty businesses had another strong quarter. As you might imagine, the addition of Pringles made a significant contribution of 10.8 points to reported sales growth. And as John mentioned, the performance of the Pringles business has been consistently better than we had anticipated. Finally, as you can see, currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.8 points in the quarter.","Now let's look at Slide 7, which shows our cost of goods sold net inflation for the full year. We saw more than $80 million of net cost inflation in the first quarter, which is more than that total net inflation we expect for the full year. As you can see on the chart, we expect continued net inflation in the second quarter, and then net deflation in the second half. Obviously, this shaping had a significant impact on our gross profit and our gross margin in Q1.","Our underlying reported gross margin declined by 330 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the net inflation and gross margin performance were consistent with our expectations. We are more than 85% covered on commodities and have good visibility into our cost structure for the year.","The inclusion of the Pringles business continued to have an impact on margins. In the first quarter, Pringles lowered total company gross margin by 80 basis points. We are continuing our work to increase margins, and we have already seen improvement. Our current outlook on the Pringles business for the year indicates gross margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points. In addition, we have executed initiatives to increase capacity, which will also have a positive impact on margins over time.","Slide 8 details some of our brand-building activity. We continue to invest in advertising and other equity-building initiatives in the quarter. As you know, brand building, along with innovation, is at the heart of our sustainable growth operating model. We know that when we invest in the business and provide value through our brands and new products, consumers will respond. You can see on the chart just some of the activity that we're executing in the first half. This isn't all we're doing around the world, but it gives you an idea of the focus that we have.","We also strive to be more efficient and effective with our investment dollars. This includes shifting to digital media on brands where it is appropriate, leveraging co-branding opportunities and assessing and maximizing the return on investment on all the activities that constitute our brand-building investment. We have increased the way we leverage advertising copy across multiple markets. We've decreased redundancies between agencies, renegotiated some agreements and driven broad-based efficiencies in working media.","Looking forward, though, we expect brand building to grow in the second quarter due to the timing of our innovation launches. Slide 9 shows the quarterly internal operating profit performance for each of our regions. North America's internal operating profit decreased by 3.5%. We saw strong mid-single-digit growth in our Morning Foods, Specialty and North America Other segment, which includes Frozen Foods in Canada. And together, these businesses posted 6% operating profit growth. However, our Snacks business posted a double-digit decline due to sales performance and because it recognized a majority of the region's cost pressure. We are taking actions to improve our performance, including the launch of innovation. And of course, the effect of inflation will decline as we proceed through the year. Consequently, we expect that results will improve during the second half of the year.","In Europe, we saw good top line growth of 2.6% in the quarter and expect continued growth over the remainder of the year. But the region faced commodity inflation and made some investments in supply chain to relaunch new Special K food in key markets. As a result, internal operating profit in Europe was flat in the first quarter. Obviously, economic conditions continue to be difficult on the continent, and this also impacted our results.","Internal operating profit in Latin America decreased by 5.6% due to commodity inflation, timing of certain supply chain costs, as well as brand-building investments in the region. And this was on top of a strong 11% comp in the first quarter of last year.","And Asia Pacific posted a decrease in internal operating profit of 30.6% in the quarter. But as you know, we have a project underway in Australia to close a manufacturing plant.","Slide 10 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Cash flow from operations was comparable year-over-year. Capital spending in the quarter was $102 million, up nearly $40 million from last year. You may recall that I mentioned on our fourth quarter conference call that we saw some capital spending shift from 2012 into 2013. So free cash flow was $236 million, a decrease versus the first quarter of last year due to the shift in capital spending.","Share repurchases this quarter were $44 million, lower than proceeds from options which were $259 million. And as we have said, we expect to repurchase shares to the extent of options proceeds.","Now let's look at Slide 11, which shows our guidance for 2013. And our outlook for the year remains consistent with previous guidance. We still anticipate that reported net sales will increase by approximately 7% and that internal net sales growth will be approximately 3%. As we told you last quarter, our internal net sales growth depends on the phasing of Pringles sales across the first and second halves. Our latest outlook is consistent with our original guidance.","Our estimates for cost inflation are unchanged at approximately 5%, and we continue to expect cost savings of around 4%. As I mentioned earlier, we saw the majority of the year's net cost inflation in Q1, but we will also see inflation in the second quarter, and we expect the third quarter and fourth quarters to be deflationary. We are largely covered on our commodities for the year and have good visibility into our cost structure. It's also important to note that our productivity savings rate increases as we progress through the year, with less than 4% in the front half and more than 4% in the back half. We continue to expect that reported operating profit growth will be slightly higher than reported earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. You'll remember that this is because of some favorable onetime items below operating profit that benefited earnings per share growth last year. Also, recall that our guidance provided on the fourth quarter call included a $0.02 headwind from currency translation.","Currency rates were volatile in the first quarter, and we saw as much as a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind for the year. And the Venezuela devaluation was slightly more than we thought for the year. The impact of dilution is also a little greater than we anticipated as the result of the strong share price.  Now depending on what happens over the rest of the year, these 2 items could put pressure on our outlook. However, we have plans below the line to offset the impact.","Obviously, currency translation will remain volatile, so we'll update you regarding the effect of the year as it progresses. The underlying tax rate for 2013 is still expected to be approximately 30%, and our estimate for interest expense is between $230 million and $240 million.","Turning to Pringles, we still anticipate $0.12 to $0.14 of integration cost for the year, and we remain on track to deliver synergies of $50 million to $75 million in 2013. Annual cash flow is expected to be between $1.1 million and $1.2 billion, with capital spending still anticipated to be slightly more than 4% of sales. As some of you have asked, I'd like to remind you that this does include the capital investment in the Pringles business we discussed with you previously.","Finally, just a quick word on the second quarter. We expect strong reported sales growth and solid comparable sales growth, but we do anticipate that there will be a continued impact from the softness in the U.S. Snacks business. And we believe that we are not likely to gain traction until the second half of the year. We continue to expect good reported operating profit growth, including the benefit of 2 months of Pringles profits, but the shape of net inflation combined with investment to support innovation launches and the softness in the U.S. Snacks business could result in internal operating profit being relatively flat in the second quarter. We expect better profit growth in the second half due to the net cost deflation and the Pringles synergies I discussed earlier.","As was the case last quarter, our guidance for operating profit and earnings per share excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments.","And one last housekeeping matter. Our Kashi business was previously reported as a component of our U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi operating segment. Earlier this year, we folded the respective Kashi cereal and Kashi snacks businesses into our Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks operating segments to better align strategy and execution. The changes to results are not material, but we have provided comparable 2012 data in Appendix 6 of this presentation.","And now I'll turn it back over to John for a discussion of our segment.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Slide 12 shows the internal net sales growth performance of Kellogg North America. As you can see, the first quarter's results remained solid at 1.7% growth.","Slide 13 shows the performance of the U.S. Morning Foods segment. Internal sales growth was 1.6% in Q1. Our cereal business gained 0.3 of a point of share in the first quarter. This was driven in part by Special K. We've had good innovation on the brand, including Chocolatey Strawberry and a restage of Special K Protein. All of this led to a very successful resolution program. And in fact, during Q1, Special K saw increased share, consumption and household penetration.","Other brands also did well, including Mini-Wheats and Frosted Flakes, both of which gained share on strong rates of consumption. Although category growth improved sequentially during the quarter, it has been a little bit slower than we would like in recent periods. While the kids segment has been doing well, the adult segment has been lagging. Special K activity, I mentioned, is helping, and we're also doing our part with innovation. We have a lot of activity planned for the middle of the year that will address this further and which will be supported with brand building. The new products include Raisin Bran with Omega-3, Multi-Grain Special K, Kashi GOLEAN Vanilla and Kashi Cheer Heart to Heart, some of which are pictured on the slide.","In addition, we're also expanding the definition of our categories. In the breakfast segment, the drinkable breakfast products you saw at our Investor Day in November are now expanding distribution, and we've also got hot cereal planned for introduction at midyear. These are both exciting steps for us and should also help drive adult consumption in the broader category.","And finally, Pop-Tarts again had a strong quarter, with nearly 5% consumption growth and share growth. We also have some great innovation coming with 2 varieties of peanut butter-flavored Pop-Tarts launching in June. These are great products, which we are sure will contribute to the brand's continued success.","Now let's turn to Slide 14 which details the internal net sales performance of the U.S. Snacks segment. The business posted an internal sales decline of 1.7% in the quarter. The cracker business posted a slight net sales decline, although the 4 main brands, Cheez-It, Town House, Club and Special K in combination, posted low single-digit sales growth. And remember that crackers were lapping a difficult high single-digit comparison in the first quarter last year. The sales performance this year was also partially driven by the timing of innovation. We've got increased innovation launching later in the year and expect this to drive better performance.","The cookie business declined in the first quarter, due in part to a decline in 100 Calorie packs and the timing of promotions. The wholesome snacks business posted 3% sales growth, and we saw good growth in the business from innovation, including Special K Pastry Crisps and Nutri-Grain Fruit Crunch. In fact, the whole Nutri-Grain brand is growing as a result of the effective support, and we've got good commercial plans and more innovation planned for the whole segment at midyear.","As you know, our Pringles business is not included in internal sales. If we'd owned Pringles during the first quarter of last year, net sales for the total snack segment would have been approximately flat due to the strong performance of Pringles. We gained nearly 1 point of share in the potato chip category in the quarter, as we benefited from strong commercial activity.","Sales increased at a double-digit rate driven by distribution gains and good advertising, and growth was broad based. The Pringles brand is very responsive to investment and activity, and we've got more planned for the balance of the year. So we're not happy with the recent performance of the Snack business. Some of the weaknesses is due to timing, but core results could be better. The team is working hard, and we have plans for improved innovation and support. The business will likely remain challenging in the first half, but we're optimistic that results will improve over time.","Slide 15 shows the performance of the North America Other segment, which includes the Canadian and Frozen Food businesses. The segment posted 7.4% internal net sales growth in the first quarter. In Canada, we saw low single-digit internal net sales growth. Cereal, crackers, frozen foods and the new breakfast beverages all contributed. Special K also gained share in Canada in Q1 due to a strong New Year's resolution program and good innovation, much like we saw in the U.S. In addition, other innovation contributed to sales growth such as Krave, Special K Granola, Nutri-Grain Bakes and Special K Crisps all did well.","In the Frozen Foods business, we saw very strong double-digit growth in the frozen breakfast segment due to good results from innovation and gains in distribution. The new Special K Flatbread Sandwiches are doing very well and are driving most of the growth in the segment, and Eggo waffles also grew in the quarter.","We also saw growth in the veggie category in the quarter. Last year, we advertised Morningstar Farms in the important summer season and saw good lift as a result. Because of this, we're beginning the support even earlier this year and have strong innovation planned.","Slide 16 shows the net sales performance of the U.S. Specialty segment. As you can see, we posted 3.4% growth in the first quarter. We're fortunate to have Brian Huff here today to discuss the Specialty Channels business in more detail. You all know Brian from last year's Analyst Day. Brian is a 22-year veteran of Kellogg. He started with the company in 1991 in sales and became President of our U.S. Specialty Channels business in 2009.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to give you more detail.","Brian Huff","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.","I wanted to start today with a few slides to provide texture regarding the Specialty business and how we leverage and manage our portfolio across diverse channels. Specialty Channels is comprised of several distinct channels in multiple business segments representing over $1 billion in annual net sales. The 2 largest components of the business are Foodservice and the convenience and gas channel, our go-to-market model focused on business-to-business channels, specifically venues and customers catering to away-from-home consumption.","As you can see on Slide 18, we have a tremendous foundation for growth with the largest share across most of our key categories and channels, including Foodservice, Convenience and Vending. This solid foundation provides us great potential for further expansion and growth.","If you'll turn to Slide 19, you'll see the detail of the categories in which we compete. As you might imagine, we compete in the cereal, snacks, veggie food and hot breakfast categories. Kellogg's  strategy is to focus on the unique characteristics of the various Away From Home venues and to adapt and innovate across our portfolio to bring our brands and food to life. It's this combination of a strong and diverse product portfolio and channel focus that provides us with the ability to better serve our customers.","Slide 20 provides a brief history of the Specialty Channels business. As you can see, our Specialty business has evolved over time through a combination of acquisition and innovation. This progression has broadened our base and provided expansion opportunities across categories and venues. Our 2008 acquisition of Gardenburger in combination with Morningstar Farms was pivotal, as it provided us a \"center of the plate\" offering that is important to success in Away From Home venues. Most recently, our extensions into savory snacks and beverages will provide substantial opportunity for growth and expansion across all of these channels.","Now let's turn to Slide 21. At the core of our strategy is the expansion of reach and brand impressions across the consumer landscape. The channels in which we compete provide Kellogg with significant opportunities to do just that, with over 2 million points of consumer intercept. We see opportunities in many of the venues and believe that our expanded portfolio of brands and Kellogg's unique offerings have great consumer relevance in these locations.","Slide 22 shows the longer-term sales performance of our business, and you can see we've experienced good and consistent net sales growth over the past several years. Some of the key business drivers of this success have been excellent volumetric growth in the Convenience and Foodservice segment; robust innovation across the business; winning in K-12 schools; growth in the frozen breakfast category; expanding the footprint of our veggie foods business; and driving our largest brand, Special K, in single-serve options and offerings.","So starting with Slide 23, I'd like to discuss some of the opportunities that we see in the business and some of the ways in which we think we'll drive future growth. We see significant opportunities for expansion into new categories for us, specifically savory snacks and beverages. These 2 categories represent huge revenue across the industry and are currently underrepresented at Kellogg. Bringing great brands such as Pringles, Kellogg's and Special K is a huge opportunity for us as well as our customers. We will continue to drive revenue growth by focusing on 3 key areas: by driving and expanding our core brands through incremental marketplace reach, establishing a single-serve beverage business and driving increased placement of savory snacks.","While all of those opportunities are exciting, Slide 24 details some of the potential that we have as a result of the acquisition of Pringles. Pringles has been a great addition to our brand lineup and provides a strong anchor in a sandwich accompaniment that is critical in Away From Home venues. In combination with Special K and Cheez-It, these 3 strong brands bring diversity and variety to the category and provide accretive revenue growth for us and our customers.","Pictured on Slide 24 is a merchandising display that features all 3 brands in single-serve packaging. We utilize this in multiple venues, including healthcare, convenience, college university and business and industry.","Slide 25 highlights our convenience and gas channel, which, as you can see, is one of the fastest-growing channels in North America, which is fueled by product expansion and innovation. The channel continues its transformation and is improving its food offerings. This aligns extremely well with our brands.","Special K is our fastest-growing brand in this channel, with excellent growth in protein bars, chips and beverages. In the future, our strategy will continue to focus on expanding our core portfolio and reach and investing in innovation to drive continued category growth.","Now let's turn to Slide 26 to review our K-12 school business. Keeping our brands relevant and available to the 55 million K-12 students in the U.S. is a priority for Kellogg. We continue to invest in innovation and renovation of our brands to meet and even exceed USDA guidelines. Our recent success in this channel has been our Eggo mini pancakes and waffles. These products have allowed us to expand in the frozen breakfast category and bring one of our best-selling equities to K-12 schools. We know that children who start their day with breakfast perform better in school during the day, and we're committed to this important business and the role our brands can play.","Slide 27 shows the opportunities that we have in veggie foods across the Away From Home channels. Center-of-the-plate offerings are critical to this business, and we have 2 powerhouse brands in Gardenburger and Morningstar Farms that have been doing extremely well.","The veggie category remains on trend with consumers and offers us long-term sustainable growth and is currently underrepresented in Away From Home outlets. Consumers continue to seek meat alternatives, and we have terrific foods and brands that fill this marketplace need across our channels. Many growth opportunities remain in both commercial and non-commercial locations, and our strategy centers around the expansion of distribution and reach in both of these areas.","So in summary, on Slide 28, I'd like to say that we remain very committed to and excited about our great Specialty Channels business. We have a long history of strong growth, and we've seen acceleration in recent years. We have #1 share positions in most of our businesses and categories. We've now got the power of the Pringles brand, and we've got great products in exciting new categories like savory snacks and beverages. And we have more great innovation planned for introduction in this business, which have great economics. I am very proud of what the team has achieved and would like to thank them all for all of their hard work. Our success is due to them, and we're all committed to continuing our focus on these important channels, businesses, customers and consumers.","And now I'll turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Brian.","Now let's turn to Slide 29 and our international businesses. The European business posted internal net sales growth of 2.6% in Q1, which continued the improved results we've seen since the back half of last year, and we gained category share in a number of countries in the region during the quarter.","We saw excellent growth in the U.K., the largest business in the region, as we gained cereal category share and posted strong double-digit sales growth in the Kellogg's snack business. Our Crunchy Nut brand saw a very good performance driven by increased media and innovation. Other innovation also contributed, including Special K Cracker Crisps and Biscuit Moments.","On the continent, our French cereal and snacks businesses performed well and grew share, and we saw improved performance in Italy behind the restage of our Special K cereal brand. This initiative will roll out across the rest of the region in the coming months. However, Spain continues to be the most difficult country in Europe for us, driven by economic conditions. We are taking a number of actions in this business, including increasing commercial activities and changes to packaging and pack sizes. This business will remain challenging, but we're optimistic regarding its long-term potential.","Like most regions around the world, Europe posted strong Pringles consumption growth in the quarter, and this was achieved while the business was executing the integration into Kellogg's systems. So a very good performance from the team in Europe.","Internal net sales increased by 0.3% in Asia Pacific in the quarter, although we saw strong 4% growth in consumption across the region. The difference was driven by a trade inventory reduction in Australia. However, underlying performance was strong in Australia, where we gained 2 points of category share in cereal and 1.5 points in snacks. We launched breakfast drinks in Australia earlier than we did in the U.S., which also contributed to the business's sales growth.","Sales in India and Southeast Asia both increased at a double-digit rate, and Pringles also posted strong growth in the region, with underlying sales up at a high single-digit rate. We saw some softness in results in South Africa due to timing and in South Korea due to the competitive environment, but we're pleased with the underlying performance in the region and expect good results across the balance of the year.","The Latin American business posted 7.4% internal sales growth as a result of strong price\/mix gains and better volume performance. Most of the businesses in the region contributed to the overall growth. Sales growth in Mexico lagged the average in the quarter, but cereal consumption in Mexico was strong and regained share in the quarter. You'll remember that we were lapping an inventory build in the first half of last year in Mexico, which made comparisons this quarter more difficult. We also face difficult comparisons in the second quarter, but they'll get easier in the second half of the year.","We also saw good growth elsewhere in Latin America. The Brazilian business posted good sales growth as a result of both price realization and improving volume performance as we increased distribution. The Venezuelan business also did very well in a difficult economic environment.","Now let's turn to Slide 30 and the summary. The first quarter was a good start to the year with good overall sales growth. Overall operating profit results were also as anticipated and include the most significant net inflation we'll see all year. We saw continued strong performance from Pringles in most regions of the world, and the integration continues to go smoothly. And we are on track for the full year. So finally, I'd like to thank the 30,000 Kellogg employees around the world for all their hard work and dedication.","And we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of what level of upfront costs you're expecting for the full year. Given that you're coming off a year of slightly below-average investment there, should we expect to see an above-normal level of upfront cost this year, particularly with the benign inflation outlook you're guiding us to in the second half?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Matthew, our upfront costs are very consistent in 2013 with what we spent in 2012. So we're somewhere in the range of $0.10 to $0.12 of upfront cost for the year.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just one follow-up on Europe. I believe in the prior year, you had a business disruption in the first quarter, which was quickly resolved, and I'd assume that comparison flattered this quarter's results in Europe to some extent. As we're revisiting our assumptions for Europe for the balance of the year, can you give us a sense for what underlying trends would have been in Q1, excluding this factor?","John A. Bryant","We feel very good about our performance in Europe in the first quarter. It was actually in line with our expectations, if not slightly ahead of what we had expect to deliver in Q1. If you look in the U.K., we actually did see some strong growth and see share gains in both cereal and in snacks. Same is true in France. We saw gains in cereal and snacks share. We do have some softness in Southern Spain -- sorry, in Spain and Italy continuing. Even though we gained share in Italy, we continue to see weakness in Spain. So if you look at Europe in the first quarter, it was very much in line with our expectations. The operating profit margin is very similar to what we expect to see for the entire year. We're still tracking to grow sales and profits across 2013, and we're happy to say that Pringles integration is continuing to go very well also. So while I agree it's a weak comparison, we're actually tracking right where we thought we would track and on target for the year.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You portrayed the input cost inflation being a picture of 2 halves, with the second half of '13 being down, and it seems to mirror the grains inflation that we would suspect many food companies will be experiencing. Is that -- does that seem to be setting up -- barring some sort of major weather shocks come from -- in this grain crop coming up for a down into '14 picture? And if so, if this feels a lot like the second half of '09, where all participants and even the retailers are sensing that this is a rather benign period, how do you see the competitive picture shaping up? And do you see participants sort of dialing up their promotions, or perhaps people are acting more rational than they did this time in the cycle last time?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Matthew, first, on the grains. It's a bit difficult for us to predict into -- or sorry, David, on the grains, difficult for us to predict on the grains going into 2014. We've got 2 crops that will need to be planted and harvested. We do have good visibility, though, to 2013. As I mentioned, we're largely covered across our grains at this point in time, so I feel very comfortable with our outlook on input inflation for this year.","John A. Bryant","David, I can't talk to what the competitive environment might be in the future, but if you look at our results over the last few years, we've come under pressure from increasing commodity prices. So as we go into a more benign environment, we'd hope to see margin improvement as we go forward from here.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just one quick question on cereal. I think you mentioned adult cereal being a little bit more sluggish than you would have liked. Is your thinking about that category and the weakness that has seemed to persist -- are you getting any further thinking about why that category may not be as strong as one would have hoped this time in the pricing cycle?","John A. Bryant","Yes. I think if you look at the cereal category, it is a little softer than what we would like it to be. But you break it apart in different segments. So kids, we're actually growing in kids, and the category is growing in kids. In all family, we're growing, but the category is a little soft, but we feel okay about where all family is. It's really adults where the category and ourselves are both down about 5% in the first quarter, and that's where the opportunity for future growth lies. What is also interesting, David, is if you take the category and you break it up by income, the category is actually growing with low-income consumers but is actually declining a little bit with high-income consumers. So you boil it all down and say the big opportunity in the cereal category right now is high-income boomers. And so what are we doing to address high-income boomers? We have innovation coming out this year around Raisin Bran Omega-3, Heart to Heart Cheer, Special K Multi-Grain. So we have a range of innovation targeted at those adult consumers, plus we think we have a very strong adult portfolio between Special K, Kashi, Bear Naked. And if we can get those brands all driving on all cylinders, I think we can really drive all the adult consumption in the category.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask the flip side of the question on grains because -- I know it's early, but we are seeing the latest plantings of corn in history, really, at this point. So on the one hand, it's early, right, and there's not much of a correlation between late plantings and higher corn prices and yields and so forth. But on the other hand, we're getting to a point where most analysts, I think, who are looking at corn say we have about 2 weeks left before it's time to get really concerned. So I'm just wondering, Ron, what are your people seeing? What is your take on that? I know it won't affect you at all until 2014 at the earliest, but when do you start maybe worrying about the late plantings and how that might affect your longer-term commodity outlook?","Ronald L. Dissinger","It's difficult to predict. Some of our folks have told us that years previous, when there have been late plantings, we've actually seen record harvest. So it's difficult to predict, Ken, at this point in time. Obviously, we're going to continue to watch the markets. And as you know, we use -- take appropriate coverage when we think it's the right time. So we'll provide guidance as we get into the fourth quarter call in 2014.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Nothing that you're overly concerned with yet at this point?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Not at this time. No.","Operator","And next we have a question from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I actually had a question for Brian. Brian, you showed a slide in your part of the presentation with joint marketing or displays for products like Pringles and Special K. Can you talk a little bit on how such a display is actually driving sales for the brands? Because in my view, the Pringles consumer and the Special K consumer, they're different people. The products have different brand equities, different attributes. So I'm just trying to understand how this sales boost really works?","Brian Huff","Yes. No, thanks for the question, too, by the way. As we're looking at it, it's fairly early in our stages of -- with our Pringles integration and our strategy, which truly is about ubiquitous distribution as we're looking at our business and building our commercial plans. But as we've seen here in the short term, we're getting significant growth and revenue from not only the Pringles business, which, in the first quarter, was up over 30% on an organic basis, but also the halo effect that, that's having on Special K as well as our Cheez-It business. And truly, it all comes down to choice and consumer choice. So we're very excited that we have a great diversity and variety of product out in the marketplace that really do help drive that consumer choice and meet multiple consumer needs.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So is the benefit coming from the halo effect or just from the fact that you have an -- for lack of a better word, an excuse to put up these displays that are more prominent in the store?","Brian Huff","Well, we're always looking for excuses to put up more displays and showcase our brands. But what I will tell you is a big piece of what we're seeing is having our brands out there in front of the consumers. We have dynamite brands. And the strength of Pringles, Special K, as well as our Cheez-It brands, the more that we can showcase and focus them to the consumers, the better off our business performs.","Operator","And the next question is from Greg Hessler of Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is just on future capital allocation, given the buyback announcement today. It looks like you're reducing debt through the quarter. Are you planning for further debt reduction? And if so, how do you expect to balance this with the buyback plan? And then I have one follow-up.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure. In relation to the billion-dollar buyback plan that we just announced, I wouldn't read anything into that. Our expectations for 2013 are very consistent with what we've communicated previously. We intend to buy back shares to the extent of options proceeds. The billion-dollar authorization does give us the opportunity to, in 2014, buy back shares. The authorization goes through the end of April at this point in time. So our capital allocation remains the same. From the end of the second quarter last year, around the time that we purchased the Pringles business, we reduced our debt by about $700 million by the end of the first quarter here. So expectation is very consistent with what we've previously communicated.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then it looks like leverage is still somewhat elevated relative to pre-Pringles levels. Is it the company's goal to continue to reduce debt and try to hold on to the high BBB credit rating? Or are you kind of looking at it and, with rates where they are today, maybe a mid-BBB is a better target? How do you guys think about the overall credit rating?","Ronald L. Dissinger","At this time, we like our BBB+ credit rating, and our intent is to try to maintain that credit rating and pay down our debt associated with the Pringles acquisition.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick clarification and then a broader question. Ron, on the underlying gross margin down 330 basis points, is that putting the mark -- is that impacting the mark-to-market impact all in gross margin? Or is it broken between gross margin and SG&A?","Ronald L. Dissinger","The mark-to-market impact -- first of all, we mark-to-market on pensions at the end of the year; and commodities, obviously, we'll do quarterly. We did see some hangover from the mark-to-market on pensions that carried into the first quarter. There's a portion of that, that relates to our manufacturing facilities. It gets capitalized into inventory, and it comes back out in the first quarter of the year. Very consistent with what happened in 2012. In terms of the impact to our gross margin performance, the mark-to-market really had very little impact. The 2 key items that impacted our gross margin performance, Andrew, were the net inflation. That was more than 200 basis points of impact. And in addition to that, the dilution from the Pringles acquisition, having that for the 3 months of 2013 versus it not being in our numbers last year. There were a few other small items that related to upfront costs in our Asia Pacific region, and I talked about the investments in supply chain to relaunch Special K in Europe as well. The margin performance is very consistent with our plan. The other thing I would mention, our outlook for the entire year also is very consistent. So we communicated previously that we expected for the year to be down around 50 basis points. That's essentially driven by the dilution from Pringles. Our underlying or base business gross margin is expected to be flat in 2013.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, John, if we look at just the organic sales growth in Morning Foods in the quarter, I think it was up 1.7%. And I think in the fourth quarter, it was up a little over 6%. And I know some of that was a buy-in in the cereal arena. But it certainly, at least sequentially, decelerated despite pricing coming in quite a bit relative to where it was in the fourth quarter. I guess the big sort of industry thesis, but I like as well, is as pricing wanes, volume kind of starts to come back, and that was the big impact last year on volume. I guess -- are you concerned that we're either not seeing that play out or just not seeing it play out as dramatically as I think everyone, including the industry, would like to see? Trying to get a sense of if I'm reading that right.","John A. Bryant","Well, if I look within the cereal category, as I said before, we're actually seeing strength with low-income consumers, strength with kids. We're doing well in all family categories also. It's really adult where we are seeing weakness, it's high-income adults. I don't think they're really that price-sensitive. It's not about -- as prices come up, we'd normally expect volumes naturally to follow with high-income boomers. I think the real issue there is our innovation, and the innovation in the category needs to be more nutrition and benefit-oriented and, quite frankly, less about pricing and merchandising. And that's the opportunity, I think, we have as a company; I think the category has as well. And I think the more we drive into that, the more we're going to grow the business. And in addition to that, when you think about the weakness in the cereal category, we're also doing things to give people the benefits of cereals outside that normal definition of ready-to-eat cereal. So we have Kellogg's To Go Shakes, and we have the Breakfast Biscuits, and we have also hot cereal in there as well. That's also all driving our cereal consumption but not getting captured in the uptake  [ph] data. If you look in Q1, our Morning Foods sales growth was up 1.6%, 1.7%, and the consumption for cereal is actually down. Our cereal sales are actually down a little bit in Q1, and the difference there is very strong Pop-Tarts performance in the first quarter. That's what's driving the difference between consumption and shipments in Q1.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So within the U.S. Snacks business, I think there was a comment that there were some timing issues and the core results were somewhat weak. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of an elaboration on that? And is that likely to persist into the next quarter?","John A. Bryant","Yes, Alexia. Snacks' top line was down 1.7% in the quarter. If you dig within that, look at the different businesses, wholesome snacks actually performed pretty well, with shipments up about 3%. We held share, and we had some good strength behind Special K and Nutri-Grain, both up double digits. So we feel okay about wholesome snacks in Q1. On crackers, the sales were down slightly, but we were lapping a big 9% growth in the first quarter last year. We had a huge Special K Cracker Chips resolution program. As you look in 2013, our innovation is more in the second quarter, and we have 2 large new products coming out with Cheez-It Zings and Town House Pita. So we expect a much better cracker performance in Q2 as we go through the year. So that's really more of the timing, if you like, within crackers. The one business that's probably softer than we'd like is cookies, where consumption was down about 5.5% in the first quarter. Within that, we do have more innovation coming out in Q2. We have 2 \"simply made\" SKUs coming out, a butter cookie and a chocolate chip cookie, which are basically just 8 ingredients, more homemade. Plus we have a new pack design, and we have improved merchandising plans. So I think we've got programs in place on cookies. That's the one area where we're a little weaker than we would like to be from a consumption perspective. The good news is Pringles continues to do extremely well. In fact, the Pringles consumption, when you include Stix, was up 13% in the first quarter. So a very strong performance there. To answer your question about phasing in the year, probably a little bit better in Q2 and much better as we go through the back half of the year, because that innovation will start to hit towards the back part of Q2.","Operator","And next we have a question from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess just kind of following up on Alexia's question. You said, I think, Ron, that the bulk of the impact of inflation in the quarter was in snacks. Did that limit your competitiveness to the extent that Mondelez is getting more aggressive in cookies and crackers?","Ronald L. Dissinger","No. We did see more input inflation in Snacks in the first quarter, but that didn't have any impact on our end-market plans necessarily, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just another question. You answered -- I guess it was more of a bond-oriented question around the buyback as being nothing different. But you also indicated that if currency in general and the hit from the Venezuelan devaluation, as well as -- I guess it was somewhat higher shares due to the stock price and the dilution, that you could offset that and had some flexibility? Doesn't that go against what you just said about the difference in the repo?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Not necessarily. I mean, we're buying back shares to the extent of options proceeds. So what I talked about was potentially a little bit more volatility in the currencies. We said we'd seen as much as $0.03 to $0.05 of headwind, but it depends upon how that plays out for the balance of the year. And yes, we are seeing a little bit more dilution as a result of a higher share price. But we have plans and are working on items below the line to improve our performance. Those items include tax and interest costs, Eric. So when you look at our tax rate, I communicated we might be at approximately 30%. That could come down slightly based on the plans that we're working on. And same with interest costs. I communicated we could be in a range of $230 million to $240 million. We could be more towards the low end of that range based on the things that we're working on if we saw currencies continue to stay adverse. Now what we've seen just over the past couple of weeks is currencies have -- international currencies have actually started to strengthen.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So what's the right share count that we should use for the year, given your plans at the moment?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We're still seeing 1 point to 2 points of impact from share dilution.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a last question; I'll pass it on. John, I guess you've got this -- hopefully, this bucket of deflation that will give you some flexibility in the second half. You've put a lot of money back into the business in the last couple of years, whether it's on the supply chain side or on the advertising and new products side. I mean, what's your sense in terms of putting that into promotion to drive sales or seeing a balance with a greater EBIT growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that, and I'll pass it on.","John A. Bryant","Well, Eric, I think what we've said today is we're on track for our guidance for the year. So we are looking for -- to deliver that guidance, which has some margin expansion implicit in it, particularly within the back half of the year. And within that, obviously, we continue to be committed to driving our brands. As I said before, talking about the cereal category, I think it's more to do with benefits to the consumers and in communicating those benefits rather than additional promotional activity or pricing and so on. That would be an alternative way of investing the money.","Operator","And our next question is from Jonathan Feeney of Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","John, you mentioned the opportunity here is in innovation at the high end. I can't argue with that if you're having success at the low end. But when I look at your volume over the past 5 or 6 years, it's down both in North America and globally at a time when pricing was up about 20%, 18%, respectively, for those regions. And I'm just going off the organic numbers you've given us over that time. So correct me if I'm wrong, but gross profit has to be way up. And I guess I'm wondering, does -- gross profit per unit, I'm talking about. Do you -- I guess, do you -- has that been consistent that the low end has been doing better than the high end over the past couple of years? And is it possible that you could accelerate even more by taking pricing down? Or is it really just that you haven't done enough on the high end and messaging?","John A. Bryant","Yes, Jonathan. I think if I go back to when we were really doing well in the 2000s, we were driving Special K and Kashi very aggressively and were seeing good growth in that business, and that, in turn, then drives the category performance. I think that's an opportunity as we go forward here.","Operator","Our final question will come from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions for you. I wanted to ask, first of all, in relation to the gross margin performance, you indicated around -- over $80 million of net inflation if I heard that correctly? Meaning that, that comes through the majority of your gross margin decline for the quarter? Pringles, I assume, also was a bit of a drag on the gross margin. So I know it's not fair to call it underlying, because the inflation is part of the business, but it would sure seem like the underlying business, if you will, kind of getting past that inflation, was pretty solid in the quarter. Would you agree with that viewpoint?","Ronald L. Dissinger","That's a very fair statement. So more than 200 basis points of the gross margin impact was this net inflation impact. And then as I mentioned, 80 basis points from Pringles. So the underlying health in the business really was quite strong.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a question regarding promotional spending overall. You had positive price realization. I'm just curious how -- if you could characterize promotional spending in your categories and how Kellogg's promotion was in the quarter. I know there's been a couple of questions around this, I wasn't clear on how -- if your promotion was up in the quarter or down versus the price realization.","John A. Bryant","We always compete in intensely competitive categories. And I'd say that all of our categories, while they were competitive, they're reasonably rational. So I think that we continue to operate according to our plan, and our plan comes back to really brand building and innovation and driving and exciting the consumer. So we're staying competitive out there, but I -- and I'm not seeing any increasing competitive pressures that overly concern me.","Simon Burton","Okay. Thank you, guys, for joining us.

Welcome to the Kellogg Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick","Thank you, Gary, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our review of our second quarter 2019 results and an update of our full year 2019 outlook.","I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer.","Slide 3 shows our usual forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements, actual results could be materially different from those projected.

A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, August 8. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","As always when referring to our results and outlook unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on a currency neutral basis for net sales and on a currency neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.","And now I will turn it over to Steve.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, John and good morning everyone.","In a business turnaround, there is nothing more important, - to continuously report back to our share owners that we are executing our strategy as planned and that we are delivering our results as planned and that's exactly what I had the opportunity to do here today.","There is no more compelling evidence of this than in our organic net sales growth, which is shown in Slide 5. Ever since we pivoted in Q4 2017 from our cost reduction phase and into and invest for growth phase, we have been committed to and demonstrating a gradual improvement in organic net sales growth.","This is absolutely critical for long-term profit growth. It has required heavy lifting, we had to exit DSD and free up resources. We had to revitalize brands through repositioning and investment. We had an innovation pipeline that had to be refilled. And we had to shift our portfolio to faster growth categories and markets.","And it's working. Q2 was the purest example of this with organic net sales growth of more than 2% and it's not just that this is our best organic growth since 2016 or even since 2012 if you exclude the inflationary benefits of Venezuela in prior years, it's the fact that this growth was broad based with all four regions in growth.","It's the fact that our enhanced capabilities in revenue growth management are yielding improved price realization in a year of notably high cost inflation. It's the fact that our innovation launches are off to a great start and it's the fact that we are holding or gaining share in more of our categories than before.","And what may be a surprise to many of you, it's the fact that we can post this kind of growth for the total portfolio even in a quarter when our closely watched U.S. cereal business declined meaningfully amidst a pack size harmonization. This organic net sales growth is the truest sign that we're making strong progress in deploy for growth. But it's not only sign of progress in Q2. Slide 6 shows some more elements that you should be aware of.","First, we've continued to reshape our portfolio. Just this week, we closed on the divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crust and ice cream cones businesses. It's never easy saying goodbye to colleagues, but these brands are going to a more suitable home and Ferrero is truly a world-class organization.","For us the closing of this divestiture means we now have a portfolio that is more focused on our most advantaged brands and categories with a better growth profile and higher profit margins. Meanwhile, we continue to expand in emerging markets, particularly through snacking not only because of successful acquisitions and partnerships, but also from geographic and product line expansion.","We posted another quarter of good growth in Russia, we grew double digit again as we expand in West Africa and the Middle East and we continue to grow strongly in Brazil, led by our parity business.","Second, we've seen improved in-market performance in developed markets as well. In particular, we are pleased to see the momentum in key snack brands that we knew we had to revitalize, we'll talk more about these later.","Third, our improved innovation pipeline is bearing fruit as we told you our net sales from newly launched products in 2019 will be the highest in at least four years. But more importantly they're doing well, particularly on new food platforms like Cheez-It Snap'd.","Fourth, we've continued to grow on the go offerings, remember this was a key priority for us as we take advantage of this growing occasion. We had another strong quarter of consumption growth in key U.S. snacks categories and we continue to use single serve to reach affordable price points in emerging markets.","Fifth, we've realized price as I mentioned, this was important in an environment where we are facing our highest cost inflation in years, but it also gives you a read on how much we've improved our capabilities in revenue growth management.","And lastly, we've realigned our business I touched on this earlier, but it bears repeating, because this isn't easy. Extracting stranded costs requires a complete re-arranging of organization and processes and you should feel good that we are proactively and immediately addressing this.","We also took the opportunity to restructure our European business, both should add to the agility and speed we have been seeking to enhance. So another eventful quarter with continued progress, the profit will follow, particularly as we get past the initial heaviest investments as we start to surmount our accelerated cost inflation in challenging cost comparisons, but we're building for the long term and we like where we're headed.","With that let me turn it over to our new CFO, Amit Banati who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Amit?","Amit Banati","Thanks, Steve and good morning everyone.","First, let me start by saying that it's an honor and privilege to be here today on my first earnings call as CFO. I look forward to working with you all.","Our Q2 and first half results are summarized on Slide 8. Context is important here. Since late last year we've been telling you how 2019 would play out. We said that organic net sales growth would improve gradually as revitalized brand sustained momentum as price realization improves and as Multipro anniversaries and starts to contribute to organic growth. That is certainly playing out as Steve just discussed.","We said the gross margin would be down year-on-year, especially in the first half, owing to tougher input cost comparisons and the fact that our On the Go pack format margins remain a year-on-year negative until major corrective actions kick in during the second half. But we told you we would see gradual sequential improvement in gross margin and that's exactly what we saw again in quarter two.","We said that the result of these factors would be year-on-year decreases in operating profits during the first half, returning to growth in the second half, excluding any divestiture impact. If anything, our operating profit declined less than expected in both Q1 and Q2 affording us the ability to better balance what was already a back weighted plan.","And we noted particularly difficult year-on-year comparisons for tax rate during the first half. Further, adding to this first half, second half disparity on earnings per share. And again through the first half we are actually a little ahead of our EPS expectations.","Finally, on cash flow, we said that we would likely be flat year-on-year before any divestitures or related business realignment charges and outlays. Through the first half we are ahead of last year on cash flow.","So our Q2 and first half results are clearly in line with our stated plan and they give us increased confidence in our full year outlook. Let's now go into a little more detail.","I'll start at the top of the P&L, with net sales growth and Slide 9. Steve covered this pretty well already pointing out that this Q2 performance was our best organic growth in some time. I'll just point out a few other items to consider as you model us. One, the organic growth was broad-based. As already mentioned, we generated organic growth in all four regions, among our categories globally, snacks led the growth, but we also grew in frozen and in noodles. Cereal was down, mainly because of our U.S. business but it continues to grow in emerging markets. So we feel pretty good about our foundation for growth.","Two, we have executed revenue growth management actions across the globe and across categories over the past two to three quarters, including in quarter two. So there is a near-term relationship between the decline in volume and our positive price mix. We would expect them to balance out a bit as we get into the second half.","Three, Multipro's consolidation which we treat like an acquisition from a reporting standpoint anniversaried on May 2nd during Q2. So that is now in our organic basis net sales. Starting in Q3, we will start to see the impact of our divestiture which depending on seasonality will reduced reported net sales by roughly 4 to 5 percentage points in Q3 and Q4.","And four, currency translation has been more negative than we anticipated, though this pressure should moderate a bit in the second half as we start lapping last year's U.S. dollar appreciation.","To wrap it all up and we are up 1.3% year-on-year on an organic basis through the first half, which should give you confidence in our full-year forecast for net sales growth of 1% to 2% both on a currency neutral basis and on an organic basis.","Now let's turn to our gross profit margin on Slide 10. As we have communicated previously, we expect our gross margin to decrease year-on-year in 2019 but for this decline to moderate as the year goes on. That's what happened in Q2 when our gross margin decline moderated from Q1's decline. Let's look at each of the three buckets, we've been using to explain this margin pressure.","The first is mechanical. About 40 basis points of this decline was simply the mechanical impact of consolidating Multipro for one month in the quarter in April, in which we were not yet lapping the consolidation last year. As we get into the second half, our divestiture provides a small positive benefit.","The next bucket is what we call growth related. As in recent quarters, this bucket was negative year-over-year. Once again, most of the growth-related impact in quarter two was related to the mix and cost impact of our shift towards emerging markets and notably toward On the Go pack formats in our North America snacks categories. As you know, we have taken some steps to mitigate this impact such as SKU rationalization and revenue growth management and we did see sequential improvement.","But the big results such as centralized packing centers and repatriating some co-pack volume don't begin to yield benefits until the second half. That's why we expect to see less negative impact to this overall growth-related bucket in Q3 and maybe even a positive swing by the fourth quarter.","The final bucket is what we call ongoing. As we've discussed previously, we not only have higher input cost inflation in this year, but we also comparing against notably favorable hedges last year, especially in the first half. This too is a pressure that is expected to moderate slightly each quarter.","Again, none of this is new news. And we expect continued sequential improvement in gross margin performance. Multipro's negative mechanical impact is behind us and will be replaced by modestly positive mechanical impact of our recent divestiture.","The revenue growth management actions that commenced in quarter four 2018 have been fully implemented and actions to restore profit margins on our On the Go pack formats are well underway and input cost inflation gets slightly less negative.","Now let's move below the operating profit line turning to Slide 11. As we have discussed previously, we faced some headwinds on these below-the-line items in 2019, particularly in the first half. So that's what we saw again in quarter two.","Interest expense, for example, was a modest year-on-year headwind because the year ago quarter did not have a full three months of borrowings for our additional stakes in Nigeria. Other income is down year-on-year as we had indicated because of the impact on pension expense, mainly due to a pension asset base that declined sharply with the financial markets last December. Once again, the biggest year-on-year headwind was on tax rate.","Our effective tax rate in Q2 and in Q1 was in line with our full-year guidance of approximately 21%. However, because of a sizable discrete benefit in the year earlier quarters this was a significant drag on EPS in both Q1 and Q2. This becomes less of a headwind in the second half. So again, none of this is new news and it's coming through as anticipated.","Before we get into our guidance for the year, let's discuss our recently completed divestiture shown on Slide 12. With the completion of the transaction, we continue to forecast a net negative impact on our full-year 2019 operating profit of about 4% to 5% from the absence of the divested business. As you know, we sold these businesses for $1.3 billion, or roughly $1 billion net of taxes.","As previously disclosed, we are using the net proceeds to reduce debt and we recently announced a tender offer for this purpose. This reduces our leverage and enhances our financial flexibility. Though the cost of the tender will largely offset the savings on interest expense this year. More important than how this transaction impacts our 2019 P&L is what it does for our overall growth for our overall growth and margin profile going forward, not only were these lower growth and lower margin businesses for us, but we can now focus more attention and resources on our best categories and brands.","So let's move to our 2019 full-year outlook and guidance which is shown on Slide 13. We are making no changes to our full-year guidance for net sales, operating profit and earnings per share and updating our cash flow guidance for the divestiture impact.","Let's take a look at each currency-neutral net sales are still expected to be 1% to 2%. Just as we guided last quarter, in effect, the five months of divestiture in the second half offsets the four months multiple acquisition in the first half. Meanwhile organic net sales growth is still forecast to be 1% to 2% as well.","Currency neutral adjusted operating profit expectations continue to be in the negative 4% to 5% range as we communicated last quarter because our operating profit finished ahead of our first half outlook. We can now re-balance what had been a back-weighted plan.","This includes adding back investment to quarter three that was delayed from the first half as we brought on additional capacity and work through organizational changes and the divestiture and currency neutral adjusted EPS is still expected to be down 10% to 11% with debt redemption costs in Q3 largely offsetting interest savings. So no change to our full-year P&L guidance just increased confidence based on first half performance and clear or visibility on the recently closed divestitures impacts.","Slide 14 looks at our cash flow guidance, from a cash flow perspective you may recall that last quarter we told you it was too early to call, given the uncertainties around the timing of our divestiture, the transition services plan and business realignment to address stranded costs.","Now with the benefit of the divestiture transaction has been closed. We have increased visibility into cash flow expectations for the full year. From an accounting standpoint $1.3 billion of gross proceeds from the divestiture will show up outside of cash from operating activities, but the taxes paid on those proceeds are in cash from operating activities, that's approximately $260 million.","We'll also have the absence of the divested businesses cash flow for the remainder of the year and we will incur upfront cash costs related to the transaction and business realignment and restructuring. The net of all of this is that cash flow in 2019 temporarily dips to about $0.5 billion.","The key thing to note is that the outlook for cash flow for our base business has not changed meaningfully. If anything, we are tracking towards the higher end of our previous base outlook range. Thanks to discipline on working capital and prioritization of capital expenditure.","At this point, we'll run through each of our businesses. Before I turn it back to Steve, it makes sense for me to go ahead and take you through our performance in AMEA.","Our Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa business is shown on Slide 16. AMEA had a particularly strong quarter in addition to one month of Multipro acquisition benefit, the region posted its strongest organic growth in a long time, up nearly 9% year-on-year. Multipro's continued growth had a lot to do with this as it became part of our organic growth in May.","This business again posted double-digit growth in the quarter. Even more important for AMEA in the quarter was our Snacks growth led once again by sustained momentum and Pringles. This brand gained share collectively across the region and its net sales increased at a strong double-digit rate, led by growth in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey sub region as well as in more developed markets like Australia and South Africa.","Cereal, sales were up across the region with the exception of Australia where shipment timing resulted in net sales being off slightly, but consumption remained in growth in Australia. Outside of Australia, our cereal net sales growth was broad based with growth in markets ranging from Japan and Korea to India and Southeast Asia.","Importantly, in a rising cost environment, our price realization in AMEA was strongly positive in the quarter, reflecting good execution of revenue growth management so we saw good overall momentum in AMEA in the first half and we expect good growth in the second half as well.","Let me now turn it back to Steve who will walk you through our other regions.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks Amit.","Continuing with our international businesses, let's discuss Europe shown on Slide 17. Europe continued to grow in Q2 its seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year net sales growth and its growth was fairly broad-based across the region, even despite some developed markets with challenging retailer environments growth was led by momentum in Pringles whose consumption growth remained particularly strong in the U.K. and France benefiting from our Rice Fusion innovation and an effective commercial program around electronic gaming.","This growth more than offset modest declines in wholesome snacks and cereal. Wholesome snacks, you'll recall is a business we set out to transform this year following a declining trend, while sales were flat in Q2 they are up year-to-date and innovation is performing well.","So we like where this business is heading, particularly around Rice Krispies Squares. In Cereal, we continue to make sequential progress with only a small net sales decline in Q2 and even a return to growth in the key U.K. market.","Consumption in that Cereal market and across the region is stabilizing. Europe in Q2 also featured in another key element of our strategy. Growth in emerging markets. We recorded another quarter of double-digit growth in Russia and we continue to expand elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. So another solid quarter for Europe.","Latin America posted another quarter of net sales growth. As shown on Slide 18, growth in the quarter was led by serial who sales remain strong and was again led by continued momentum in Mexico consumption and share. We continue to execute well in this key market.","Our Parati business continues to perform well, despite market softness in Brazil, we gained share in biscuits, and other key categories and we generated strong price realization. We couldn't be more pleased with the synergy progress we're making, both on the selling and the supply chain fronts. Pringles continues to outpace the category in Mexico.","However, we saw continued decline in Argentina related to economic and currency weaknesses and some temporary softness in Caribbean, Central America related to economic conditions and a distributor transition, but the brand remains in very good shape in most of the region.","Profit was pressured a bit in the quarter by input costs, transactional foreign exchange and investment in capabilities, but we feel good about how this region is performing particularly on the topline. So we expect continued growth in Latin America in the second half.","Let's now turn to North America and Slide 19. It's not a small thing that we can show you net sales growth in our biggest region after several quarters in which improvement was masked by DST price adjustments, a product recall and even shipment versus consumption timing. We're past all that and what you're seeing in Q2 is the underlying growth showing through.","Some important elements to note about this net sales growth, first, shipments were right in line with consumption this suggest that last quarter's imbalance was really just one of timing. Second, price realization came through price mix was up nearly 3% year-on-year in North America, reflecting a full set of revenue growth management actions we started implementing in late 2018 in order to offset some of the accelerated cost inflation we are experiencing.","Third, we grew even though our highly visible cereal business did not. This is true of net sales and consumption in the quarter and shows just how important our growing Snacks and Frozen businesses are to our North American portfolio.","And fourth, we're generating growth in our specialty channels. We are competing well in key categories, channels and customers. And there is plenty of opportunity here as we lean into putting our brands in key consumer occasions.","North America's profit remained pressured as expected by higher input costs and continued if moderating drag from On the Go pack formats and other mix shifts. However, North America's Q2 sales performance should give you the clearest sign yet that our strategy is working in this key market, just as it is internationally.","We've launched better innovation, we've revitalized key brands, and we've executed revenue growth management actions. And we've done all of this amidst a major reorganization and divestiture.","Let's discuss each major category in a little more detail. We'll start with Snacks on Slide 20. Once again, we generated strong growth in our five biggest snacks brands, the brands we revitalized with increased investment last year, an innovation that is shaping up to be our biggest launch here in a long time.","The U.S. consumption growth is shown on this slide. Cheez-It posted another quarter of double-digit consumption growth. The brand's core SKUs are growing and its on-the-go offerings are growing. A highlight for the brand has been the success of our exciting new platform, Cheez-It Snap'd whose velocities are just as good as the overall brand and showing strong signs of sustained growth. Pop-Tarts is also sustaining its double-digit consumption growth in quarter two.","This brand continues to grow its base business paired with a very successful innovation Pop-Tarts Bites, whose velocity is even exceeding that of the overall brand. Rice Krispies Treats returned to double-digit consumption growth aided by core SKUs and new poppers innovation. Added capacity has been a key enabler as we are no longer supply constrained. Pringles continued its growth in consumption, even as it laps strong year ago gains.","Growth has been aided by expansion of On the Go pack formats and our new wavy innovation. And RX has surged back into strong double-digit consumption growth restoring its distribution. These aren't just any brands. Collectively, they represent over 60% of our U.S. measured channel consumption for snacks, a figure that goes up to nearly 75% when we exclude our now divested cookies and fruit snacks categories. So clearly, we have our North America snacks business in very good shape.","Let's now turn to cereal and Slide 21. As we've discussed previously, our pack-size harmonization was a strategic priority this year for what it does for making our aisle more easily shoppable for enabling us to cross promote our brands and for revenue growth management. We knew it would create some disruption for us in the first half, though for competitive reasons we couldn't talk too much about it publicly, particularly since it involved pulling back on promotional activity.","It did impact consumption during the first half. On this slide, you can see how our promotional activity had to be pulled back in Q1 for our Taste-Fun segment brands, which were in the first wave of harmonization.","In Q2, their activity stabilized and their consumption improved led by our key Taste-Fun brands, Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. At the same time during Q2, you can see how we pulled back on promotion behind our Adult and All-family brands. A more recent four-week data show that we are already starting to restore normal activity. The good news is that this is now behind us.","As we get into the second half, we have a return to more normal brand building and in-store promotional activity and we like our plans. Frosted Flakes gets a new media campaign at the Special K. Honey Smacks re-launches with new food and new Pop-Tarts cereal gets expanded distribution.","And we are relaunching Kashi Go and continuing to support Raisin brand. So we expect to see the declines in net sales moderate for North America cereal in the second half. And we will finish with frozen foods on Slide 22.","This business posted solid net sales growth in Q2 led by our veggie foods business. MorningStar Farms grew consumption in measured channels despite lapping a notably strong year ago performance, while also continuing to expand in unmeasured specialty channels.","In Q2, we accelerated growth on our Chick and breakfast meat portfolio supported by increased media. This year's innovation, including the first ever Vegan Cheezeburger, as well as mini Corn Dogs and popcorn chicken offerings demonstrate how we are extending into more consumer occasions, from center plate options to snacking.","We fully understand the opportunities and dynamics emerging in this category and we are very excited about what we have in the innovation pipeline. Meanwhile, Eggo also grew consumption and net sales in Q2, despite tough comps. Growth in this strong brand has been aided by recent premium launches in French toast, as well as a new high protein offering in waffles called Off the Grid.","In specialty channels, our new Confetti Eggo Innovation drove share gains in our K-12 school segment. So we feel good about our frozen business as well and expect to see continued growth in the second half.","So let's summarize on Slide 24. We are on strategy, deploy for growth, had us thinking differently, and investing differently. We have today a much different portfolio than we did, even just a couple of years ago, one that is shaped more toward growth. We have revitalized our Snacks brands and we continue to expand in rapidly growing emerging markets. We are doing what we said we would do. We're also on plan.","Let me re-emphasize the point I made earlier. The deploy for growth and the investments behind it were intended to bring us back into organic net sales growth. As you can see on this slide, it's clearly working. We're seeing a return to organic growth in each of our four regions. And the profit and cash flow will follow.","Our top line is back in growth. We have realized price. We are addressing costs that have weighed down our gross profit margin and we expect to see continued sequential improvement in that key metric. We are now lapping the strong ramp-up of investments that started in late 2017 and we are so important for revitalizing key brands and enhancing capabilities.","We'll have a divestiture impact that will mask some of this improvement but our underlying profit performance will improve. And with this improvement will come higher operating cash flow and return on invested capital. We are also strengthening our balance sheet by using the divestiture proceeds to reduce debt.","In closing, I want to be sure to thank and praise our employees. It has been a period of incredibly heavy lifting and their expertise, hard work, passion and creativity, are what is turning around this great company.","And with that, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Could you just touch on how conservative you think your full year guidance might be? You mentioned obviously that it was - your first half was ahead of expectations. But you also touched on some spending shifts. How should we think about - are you airing on the conservative side in the second half? And also what if anything - are you factoring in for your assumptions on something like Brexit?","Steve Cahillane","I would not characterize our guidance for the back half of the year as conservative. I would characterize it as prudent. And it was always back weighted if you'll recall. So there is a significant shift in our profile from the first half to the second half. What gives us confidence is the return to organic net sales growth across all four regions and the fact that the investments that we put in place are working. We did have a lot of disruption in the first half that we were anticipating.","So if you think about what we've achieved despite a divestiture, despite a major reorganization in both Europe and North America, we are very proud and pleased with the performance of our people.","But it gives us the ability to look at the second half and some of the investments that we didn't put in Q2, we are putting into Q3 to sustain the momentum but we believe it gives us a very good chance to achieve exactly what we said we would achieve but I wouldn't characterize it as conservative, I would say it's straight down the middle.","Then in terms of Brexit, obviously Brexit is - it's still out there. We can't predict any better than anybody else exactly what will happen. There is a new Prime Minister, who seems very committed to Brexit and we continue to make the type of contingency plans that we've talked to in the past, but nothing new to report on that matter.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.","Tim Ramey","I know the debt will be going down as a result of the divestiture but have you modeled what that should do to debt to adjusted EBITDA?","Amit Banati","Yes. So I think you know, firstly a couple of comments on that. One is the tender - so from a 2019 standpoint, the tender costs will offset the interest savings. So from a P&L standpoint we expect it to be net neutral. I think from a debt-to-EBITDA level, it will get us in the four range.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Palmer","It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for the question. You had a sizable step-up in price mix this quarter versus last quarter, it didn't really seem to translate in full to the gross margin line as much as the magnitude of the step-up might have suggested. Why was this and should we expect a clear flow-through of this pricing to the margin line, as we progressed through the year?","Steve Cahillane","I'll start and then Amit can build on it. We are still - the things that we've talked about in the past in terms of input costs and a strong inflationary environment, as well as mix continue to be the issues that we're facing.","And as we've talked, we're going to see sequential improvement as we go throughout the quarters with the best performance in gross margin being in the fourth quarter and then entering into 2020. And so that hasn't really changed all that much we've had to shift some of our CapEx investments into capacity and away from On the Go, just as we stay agile and pivot based on strong demand and things like Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It and so forth to make sure we have the right levels of capacity. But you will see - continue to see sequential improvement in the gross margin as we've discussed as we - as we get into the back half of this year and into 2020.","Amit Banati","No I think Steve you've covered it. I think the mechanical impact as I mentioned in my prepared remarks will turn favorable as we get into the back half, so that drag goes away. And then I think you know some of the actions we will have better comps versus a year ago and then some of the actions on the On the Go formats, such as the repacking centers, et cetera will come into play in the second half. So I think the combination of all of that will result in an improving trend in gross margins as we go through the year.","Tom Palmer","And just to follow up on that and thank you for the color. A quarter ago you said you expected to exit the year with year-over-year gross margin growth. Is that still the case?","Amit Banati","Yes, I think that would still be our expectation. I think you know; we remain on track with our major initiatives.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","As you look at the - the cereal promotional activity for your business obviously it was up and down and down during most of the first half. I'm just curious to know your expectations for the category. And if the category needs to improve or do you expect the improvement to come from, say, market share gains, get back like a normal operating environment for your business.","Steve Cahillane","Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Clearly, we did an awful lot in the price package harmonization efforts in the first half of this year, a very consequential redo of our price package architecture. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we couldn't really talk too much about this and tip our hand in terms of, you're not going to go public and say, we're going to stop promoting.","The category is currently running at about minus 1%. I think that's a reasonable forecast. We have been losing share as we've gone through this price package harmonization because of our significant pullback on promotions as we went through it. We are not in the shared donation business. So we would expect to be back exactly where we would like to be, which is at a minimum growing with the category or staying right at the category at a minimum.","But what I would tell you is just to kind of re-emphasize, despite the challenges and headwinds in the U.S. cereal, the fact that North America was able to post a solid 1% growth despite this, we're very proud of the team and what they've gone through and what they did to deliver that type of result.","And I think it really again shows the strength of the Snacks portfolio, the Frozen portfolio, the Specialty portfolio and the different balance they were achieving in North America and indeed around the world.","Chris Growe","Thank I just had one other question. You've talked about pushing some investment into the second half of the year, we had modeled some in the first quarter, they have kind of got pushed to the second quarter, it sounds like some of that is getting pushed to the third quarter now. Do you have any frame of reference for how big that might be? And I guess really where that's focused as we have lots of interest.","Steve Cahillane","Not really a frame of reference, but I think the focus would be on Q3 because it's about what we've heard from the first half of this year into the second half. We've got really good momentum in the top line. We definitely plan on sustaining that. So from a brand building standpoint, we'll be looking at the third quarter as a good opportunity to take some of that shift from the first half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","I had a question about the transition services guidance here and how it continues into 2020. Amit, does that mean that you're getting TSA income in 2020 and that will continue, or does that phase out eventually in 2020 and create more dilution in 2020? I'm trying to - I know we have dilution this year. I'm just trying to figure out how much to expect in next year and how it relates to that transition services?","Amit Banati","Yes, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we forecasted a negative 4 to 5 full year OP impact, operating profit impact, as a result of not having the divested brand profits for 5 months. This impact may seem a little high but remember this was a very well-integrated business and much of the indirect expense stays with us during the initial transition period, before we can start reducing that trade. We're not going to give guidance on 2020. There will be an impact, neck in 2020. But we are working through that as we finalize the TSA agreements.","Robert Moskow","One quick follow-up. Promotional spending on cereal, you say you want to put it back to normal, will that put any pressure on your margins in the second half?","Steve Cahillane","No, I wouldn't expect that puts pressure on our margins. There is a lot of noise in the first half because again it was such a consequential redo of our price package architecture. But you can think about us getting back to normal competitive levels and obviously for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into great detail around exactly what we're going to do.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Real quick housekeeping, I missed your answer to how much income you're generating on TSAs per Rob's question?","Amit Banati","Yes. So I think - like we said for this year, right, the overall impact would be 4 to 5 on operating profit dilution of 4 to 5 and that includes whatever benefits we're getting from the TSA this year.","Steve Cahillane","Which are very small.","Jason English","Okay, so they're negligible. The TSAs are negligible. All right. And going back to another question in terms of the cadence of investment, I know last year was framed as an investment year, this year was framed again it's an investment year to get the top line working. Congrats on getting the top line working by the way, it's great to see the sequential improvement and building momentum there. I just, it's unclear to me where the investments are, with SG&A coming in substantially lower than last year and the same thing last year we had SG&A coming in light. What's driving the SG&A efficiency? What's happening with your brand marketing expense and where is this investment going into?","Steve Cahillane","Yes, thanks, Jason. I'd say a couple of things. First, we are lapping a significant step up that started in the back half of 2017. And as I've said in the past, we feel pretty good about where we are from a brand building investment as a percentage of sales and will remain agile and we'll do the things necessary to put the right level of pressure behind the brands, but remember we're lapping a significant double-digit increase from two years ago and so that's got something to do with the SG&A efficiencies. We've also got a reorganization that's coming through. We've got overall really good zero overhead growth practices and good strict, we've good disciplines around overall cost. And so that's driving good SG&A efficiency.","And as I said, some of it is deferred into the third quarter as well, but if the question is do you have enough brand building and how do you like where you're at. I think we can point to our organic sales growth in all four regions and say that doesn't happen by accident, obviously it happen because we put the right capabilities in place, we put good pressure against good commercial ideas in place and you're seeing the type of results flow through on Cheez-It on Pop-Tarts on Pringles and RXBAR and so we'll continue in that vein.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Grande with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grande","Well just to pursue a bit on the last question, so you had actually in your prepared remarks the momentum building for brands like Pringles, Cheez-It and some others. What are the key drivers of that momentum in your view? I mean is it execution, more marketing, did you gain in penetration or repeat purchase? I'd like to understand this better to better assess the sustainability of that momentum. Please. Thank you.","Steve Cahillane","I would say it's all of the marketing mix coming together in a really meaningful way underpinned by excellent execution. So if you take a couple of examples of that. Pringles in Europe, we are lapping the World Cup from two years ago, it would take a very good commercial idea to make that come to life and they came out with Rice Fusion as an innovation and gaming as a commercial idea and executed incredibly well and lapped growth, on growth and talking about lapping strong double-digit growth. Cheez-It in the United States.","You have Snap'd as a terrific innovation backed with very good commercial ideas coming through and you know and it's the right brand building that supporting those brands as well as innovation and then the On-the-Go offerings, which we always said, we're very under-indexed in, so it's targeting new channels in new occasions with the right commercial idea is the right innovation all bolstered by strong execution.","And so, we've done that in a lot of our portfolio and much of it is showing through in all 4 regions. We recognize, we still have work to do. The number one item under construction is U.S. Cereal, but we're taking a meaningful and purposeful approach to that through the price package architecture and approaching it the same way that we've approached all those other big brands that I just mentioned.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson","So just quick question on trajectory of the North America organic sales growth into the back half. I guess, obviously, while we appreciate the result in Q2 was great, right year-over-year. I think we do need to note that the year-ago compare was obviously materially, a little bit easier in Q2 relative to Q1. So as we get into Q3, right. If you have a little bit more brand support, maybe a little bit more innovations being pushed are kind of back on track in Cereal, so to speak. Like is the - should we all be thinking that this kind of 1% or low-single digit positive growth trajectory should continue into the back half in North America or should we also be taking under consideration just kind of what the compares are relative to Q2. And that's it.","Steve Cahillane","We're not going to give any guidance on the regions. And I would just re-emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our 1% to 2% reaffirming that top line guidance, we feel very good about the North American business, what's happening in Snacks, what's happening in Frozen, the RTEC we're past the big disruptions in the first half. And so we feel confident that the North American team is delivering and feel very confident that they'll continue to deliver.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Just two questions, I guess relative to cash flow. One is just the base business outlook for this year is now at the high end. So $1 billion and I know there's a lot of sort of transient issues that will knock that down for this year, but is that $1 billion still a decent sort of baseline that we should think about as we're looking forward. And I guess, second to that, just I don't know if I saw it or not, but just how CapEx changes now with the divestitures?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. So I think. I think that the $1 billion, is a good baseline and going forward, and I think on CapEx you that we do the ongoing prioritization of CapEx that you would expect us to do, I think, Steve mentioned, we think good demand in some of our, in some of our areas, and so we are prioritizing capacity to service the demand, but nothing, nothing really significant in change from a CapEx standpoint.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","So question on two of your larger acquisitions from the past 2 years in Multipro and Parati. How do we think about what Multipro is growing and it was only a month of inclusion organic sales calculus, but it appears like that must be growing at least 20% percent right now? And then what is really the strategy for growing Multipro and Parati in the respective markets that would be helpful.","Steve Cahillane","Yes, I'll start and turn it over to Amit who obviously is close to Multipro as you can get. We're not strip out guidance or our results on those, but we're talking about strong double-digit growth. And what it really unlocks the similarity between Parati and Multipro is, it really gives us access to a broad based distribution with affordable locally relevant foods that resonate with the consumers there allowing us to build our portfolio on top of that.","So that's the similarities between those two. And the other similarities are both outstanding countries to be in Nigeria, with 200 million consumers growing middle class, vibrant economy and Brazil obviously also a very, very attractive emerging markets.","So we like both of those acquisitions. We think both acquisition - we don't think we are confident in both acquisitions; we'll continue to do well. They have done well. I don't know if there's anything you want to add?","Amit Banati","Yes, just to give you a little bit more color on Multipro. I think if you kind of step back and look at it at our Africa strategy we decided the top 3 economies in Africa, Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt and we've made investments in all three, that places us really well in terms of the Africa opportunity going forward.","So I'd start with that, I think you know within Nigeria which is the largest economy in Africa we've made a number of investments. So Multipro is the distribution arm and the activation arm, we've also made an investment in Dufil, which is a leading food company in Nigeria. It's the number one player in Noodles which is the number one package foods category in that country and we have close to an 80 share in Noodles.","We've also set up a joint venture for Cereal and Snacks. We've launched Kellogg range of Snacks. We've put in a new manufacturing facility in Nigeria and that's off to a very strong start. We see a big opportunity on snacks in that market. The Snacks category is still forming and again we are well placed with the distribution that Multipro brings as well as our global snacks portfolio to shape that category in the next decade. So Multipro is one element, a critical element of our overall win in Nigeria and win in Africa strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","I know we're running tight on time. So maybe just quickly Steve, if you could just remind me, because I know you've probably explained it before, just the benefits that you anticipate coming from the cereal pack harmonization, is it top line benefits, is it profitability, is it to the change the relative price points relative to sort of competitors or is it - and is it part of the revenue growth management benefits that you're seeing or is it really completely separate from that. Thanks so much.","Steve Cahillane","I'd tell you a couple of things. It's really, it's starting with the consumer-first approach and aisle shopability and shelf shopability. Prior to the transformation, we had a very large number of different sized SKUs could not ship on the same pallets, could not display on the same pallets and looked awkward on the shelf next to each other. So, it allows for cross brand promotion, allows for better shopability.","Yes, there is a benefit in the factories obviously, when you take out complexity in the number of SKUs, clearly that's in there. So there is a lot of meaningful benefits that accrue to the moves that we've made, but it really starts with the consumer first approach to making our brands simpler to shop.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question will come from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Good morning, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to come back to price mix and promotion in North America. I understand the moving parts around the cereal business but promo levels are also down across pretty much all the main categories in the portfolio and that's kind of in the trend for the past year or so. So how much of that movement in promo outside of cereal should we consider as kind of the new normal, given the revenue management activities, versus I guess how much of it is just still more kind of programming and timing related?","Steve Cahillane","I think you probably should think about a lot of it being timing related. I wouldn't point to any meaningful change in the competitive landscape in North America in any of our categories. We are happy that we're seeing stronger base sales that's coming from the brand-building investments to good innovations, the momentum in the brands, and we have a brand - a number of brands that are growing double-digits, obviously the retailers happy with that, consumers happy with that, we're happy with that allowing for that base business to continue to grow.","But I wouldn't point to any significant change in the competitive landscape. We're just, we're feeling very good about where our brands are relative to the momentum, particularly in Snacks and Frozen and a clear understanding, a very clear-eyed understanding of what we need to do in U.S. cereal to get to a better place as well.","John Baumgartner","And then Steve, just on that the positive 3% price mix in North America for Q2, can you give any clarity there on how that splits out between price and mix? I mean is the mix a tangible benefit at this point in time?","Steve Cahillane","Yes, I think we're just looking that up. I think it's across, it's across price mix pretty even.","Amit Banati","Fairly balanced between price and mix.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference has also now concluded.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A session. Thank you. Please note this event is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick","Thank you, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter 2019 results and update of our full year 2019 outlook. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Fareed Khan, our Chief Financial Officer who has announced that he will be leaving Kellogg this summer. Therefore we are also joined by Amit Banati who is on the call not only as our current President of AMEA, but also as our incoming CFO.","Slide number three shows our usual forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to this third slide of the presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.","A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, May 9th. The call will also be available via webcast which will be archived for at least 90 days. As always when referring to our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral adjusted basis unless otherwise noted.","And now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks John and good morning everyone. I think it's appropriate to start the call with our news of a transition in our Chief Financial Officer role. As you saw in our press release, Fareed will be leaving the company following the completion of our second quarter. Fareed has contributed mightily to the completion of Project K and to the creation and launch of our Deploy for Growth strategy. He has shown a real passion for growing our business and he's been a valued partner to me and to our entire executive committee. So, thank you Fareed for your service.","We are fortunate to be able to name a fellow executive committee member Amit Banati to succeed Fareed. Most of you already know Amit who has been a driving force behind the transformation of our Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa business. Not only does he have AMEA on track to more than double in size during his tenure, but he's diversified its portfolio, improved the margins of the base, and posted consistently solid results.","What you may not know about Amit is that he earned his finance stripes early in his career which makes him a particularly effective and financially-oriented general manager.","Because these two gentlemen have worked together for the past couple of years and because Fareed is staying on to ensure a smooth transition, you can be confident that this transition will be orderly and will cause no disruption to our plans, our results, or our transparency with investors. You'll hear from both of them momentarily.","Turning to the quarter, I would describe our Q1 as on strategy and on plan. During the quarter, we took further decisive actions under our Deploy for Growth strategy. Some of these are listed on slide number six.","For instance, we continued to shape a growth portfolio reaching an agreement to sell cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones to Ferrero. While it's never easy to depart with solid brands and talented employees, we feel good that they are all going to a quality company. And for us, this divestiture will focus our portfolio on our biggest snacking categories and brands and improve our financial flexibility through a better margin mix and reduced debt. We reached an agreement expediently and will likely record a small gain on the sale. So, a very good outcome.","Importantly, we continued to expand our emerging markets presence. Focusing on affordability and occasions, we have broadened our product line both in foods and packaging. And recognizing the critical importance of distribution in these markets, we have bolstered our go-to-market capabilities and reach.","As a result, our emerging markets had another strong quarter of organic net sales growth and that does not even yet include the double-digit growth of our Nigerian distributor, Multipro.","We also continued to invest in capabilities and processes. As you know we recognized our North America -- we reorganized our North America structure for a flatter, more nimble organization. As our new ways of working get refined, we should see greater agility and focus.","We realigned global resources around key commercial priorities and we invested money and resources into areas like digital and e-commerce. All of this requires investments upfront, but will enhance our competitiveness.","We're also on plan as described on slide number seven. Last year we invested in revitalizing key brands, we adjusted their positioning and their messaging, we ramped up their brand support and commercial execution, and it's working.","Brands like the ones listed here did swing into growth or accelerate in 2018. This continued in 2019 with moderated investment behind these now revitalized brands all according to plan. We spent the last couple of years enhancing our innovation capabilities and rebuilding a pipeline.","In Q1, we launched a significantly greater quantity and quality of innovation than we have in years. Its early days, but as we'll discuss in a moment, these innovations are off to good starts.","We also invested in pack formats such as retail-ready cases, harmonized pack sizes in cereal and On the Go and affordability offerings around the world, just as we said we would. Also as we previously communicated, we implemented revenue growth management actions in the marketplace, across the globe and across our portfolio. Some of these actions started in late Q4, and some of them were implemented during Q1. Our international regions are showing solidly positive price realization already, while North America is just getting going but turned positive already.","As a company, we returned to organic growth in net sales in Q1, and this was despite some headwinds in North America. As we'll discuss in a moment, our recall of certain RXBARs required inventory write-offs at our customers, pressuring net sales and profit. And we saw timing differences between shipments and consumption in certain categories, notably U.S. Cereal. But behind these headwinds was good growth on core brands in North America, and our international regions continued to grow strongly.","So we come out of Q1 on track for our first half and full year earnings estimates. And our full year guidance does not change either, safe for layering on the impact of our already announced divestiture. So we're on strategy and on plan. Now, let me turn it over to Fareed, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.","Fareed Khan","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how much I've enjoyed my time at Kellogg and in working with all of you. And I can assure you that you're in very good hands with Amit, and he will continue to drive Kellogg in the right direction.","Now to our results: Our Q1 results are summarized on slide number 9. Let's first recall how we indicated 2019 would play out. We said that organic net sales growth would improve gradually as we revitalize brands, sustain momentum, as price realization improves and as Multipro anniversaries and contributes to organic growth in the second half. We said gross margin will be down in the first half, owing to a tougher input cost comparisons and the fact that our On the Go price format margins remain a year-on-year negative until major corrective actions kick in during the second half.","The result would be year-on-year decreases in operating profit during the first half, returning to growth in the second half. And we noted particularly difficult year-on-year comparisons for tax rate during the first half, further adding to its first half\/second half disparity on EPS. Q1 played out according to the script. Net sales grew year-over-year, including on an organic basis. Operating profit declined as we said it would because of higher input and mix-related costs. It actually came in a little ahead of our expectations in part because of some investment that we delayed.","EPS was where we said it would be largely because of the below-the-line items we had discussed previously. This EPS was ahead of our expectations, though much of this was timing and effectively comes right out of Q2. Our cash flow came down with a lower net income as well as the timing of tax payments and capital expenditures within the year. However, Q1 is a seasonally light quarter for cash flow. And it's important to note that cash flow in Q1 came in higher than we expected. Overall, these results put us right on track for the first half and full year guidance we gave back in February.","Let's go into a little bit more detail. Let's start at the top of the P&L with net sales growth in slide number 10. Obviously, much of our reported net sales growth came from the consolidation of Multipro into our results. This will anniversary in early May and Multipro's net sales will start contributing to our organic growth. A good portion of this was offset in Q1 by a particularly adverse currency translation due to a strong dollar year-on-year.","Dollar, as you know, began strengthening in Q3 last year and even strengthened further in Q1. Importantly, we returned to net sales growth on an organic basis. Volume was down slightly year-on-year, owing mainly to shipment timing in U.S. Cereal. Our price mix turned positive in Q1 as a result of revenue growth management actions we've been taking since late Q4. Every region posted positive price mix, and KNA's modest price realization would have been higher if it were not for the write-offs of trade inventory related to the RX recall. So slower start because of the RXBAR recall and the cereal trade inventory decrease, both of which should be Q1-specific events, both these events, you can clearly see, we are back on the road to steady organic growth. And our consumption trends confirm this.","Now let's turn to our gross profit margin on slide number 11. As expected, our gross margin declined year-on-year. Let's look at each of the three buckets we've been using to explain this margin pressure. The first is mechanical. About 110 basis points of this decline was simply the mechanical impact of consolidating Multipro, which was not in our P&L in the year ago quarter. We will have one more month of this mechanical impact in April, after which Multipro will have a much smaller mix-related impact. The next bucket is what we call growth related.","As in recent quarters, this bucket was negative year-over-year. One driver was the RXBAR recall, which is now behind us. But most of the growth related impact in Q1 was related to the mix and cost impact of our shift towards emerging markets and notably towards On the Go pack formats in our North American snacks categories. We've talked about this in recent quarters, and you'll recall that our strategy of pursuing single serve led to an aggressive increase in On the Go SKUs, along with an acceleration of demand for these products. And this resulted in sizable extra costs for redeployment, co-packing and even repacking.","We have taken steps to mitigate this impact such as SKU rationalization and revenue growth management. But the big resolves such as centralized packing centers and repatriating some co-pack volume don't kick in until the second half. The good news is that the impact in Q1 was as expected, and we expect to see less and less impact as the year progresses. The final bucket is what we call ongoing. As we've discussed previously, this turned negative this quarter because of input cost inflation and the comparisons with last year.","While exchange-traded commodities have largely moved sideways in recent months, many of our very favorable edges from last year have rolled over and we're experiencing accelerated inflation fuel in various non-exchange-traded inputs.","In Q1, we also faced our toughest comparison of the year, as the year ago quarter was the one quarter in which our COGS rate was not inflationary. This was all anticipated when we spoke to you back in February. The good news is that, we remain confident in our gross margin that will get less and less negative as it grows -- as the year goes on. And remember this will be driven by revenue growth management actions, many of which were implemented during Q1; efforts to restore margins on On-the-Go items which will have a larger positive impact in the second half; and easier comparisons for ongoing input costs in the second half.","As we make our way to EPS, it's important to remember some of the drivers below operating profit. Some of these are shown on slide number 12 and selected to remind you that there'll be earnings headwinds in the year. The biggest headwind for us was tax rate.","Our effective tax in Q1 came in at 20.5%, right in line with our full year guidance of approximately 21%. However, because of a sizable discrete benefit in the year earlier quarter, this was a significant drag on EPS growth in Q1, as we had forewarned. We'll face another comparison against the year-on-year -- a year ago discrete benefit in Q2.","Interest expense for example, was a $5 million year-on-year headwind because the year ago quarter did not yet have the borrowings for additional stakes in Nigeria. Going forward, the year-on-year increase in interest expense moderates as we lap this Nigerian investment, although the rates are somewhat higher.","Other income is down year-on-year as we had indicated because of the impact on pension expense of higher interest rates and a pension asset base that declined sharply with the financial markets last December. This will continue to be a drag all year. Before we get into our guidance for the year, it's important to discuss the only element of our guidance that's changing our pending divestiture.","So let's go to slide number 13. We'll begin by making sure everyone is clear on what we are selling. While we are selling the Keebler brand in the transaction amongst other brands, we are not selling the entire business that we acquired in 2001. We're selling cookies, pie crusts and ice cream cones collectively which was a small portion of that acquisition plus fruit snacks. We are not selling the larger more profitable portion of that Keebler acquisition which is crackers.","To give you an idea of the size of the business we are divesting, we've disclosed previously that they generated close to $900 million net sales in 2018 and about $75 million of operating profit including all indirect expenses. As Steve mentioned, we're very pleased that these great brands and the talented employees are going to a company of Ferrero's caliber.","Now let's talk about the near-term financial impact of this divestiture. Slide number 14 reviews the details and the financial implications we disclosed in early April when we announced we had the agreement to sell these businesses. We are still anticipating a close of the transaction at the end of July. There's still details to be worked out and we'll know more obviously in the coming months.","Of the $1.3 billion sales price, we believe the after-tax net proceeds will be somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion. And our plan is to use all of it to pay down debt. This will enhance our financial flexibility. And all of this was disclosed back in April.","So now let's turn to our full year guidance in slide number 15. As we've mentioned, we are right on track for the guidance that we gave a few months ago, so no change to our pre-divestiture guidance. While we won't close on the divested transaction until the end of July, many of you have already adjusted your earnings models for this divestiture using the information we provided on our April 1 announcements. We're making no change to that estimated divestiture impact today. Everything remains on track.","We can give you a little bit more detail on this divestiture impact and it's shown on slide number 16. Let's take each metric in turn assuming the transaction closes at the end of July, which means that impacts Q3 and Q4. Pre-divestiture currency-neutral net sales, is expected to be up 3.4% as previously guided. But the divestiture would reduce this outlook by two to three points from losing the divested brands' net sales for the five months or so depending on the closure date.","There is no change to our outlook for organic net sales growth of 1% to 2%. Organic by definition, excludes any divestiture impact. And while the absence of this business may improve our organic growth, it's a very slight impact over the next few months. Pre-divestiture currency-neutral adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat per our previous guidance. But the divestiture would trim four to five points from this due to not having the divested brands' profit for five months. This impact may seem large relative to true operating profit of these brands, but remember that much of the indirect expenses stay with us at least during the transition period before we can reduce them ourselves.","Pre-divestiture currency-neutral adjusted EPS is expected to be down 5% to 7% which has been our guidance. This divestiture -- the divestiture as we have shared with you last month is expected to be less than 5% dilutive which should bring the EPS decline to something more like 10% to 11%.","It's too early to call the impact on cash flow. It will depend on upfront costs related to the transaction, the transition of the businesses to the new owners and any business realignment required after the divestiture. And we'll certainly keep you posted as we gain better visibility on this.","These are the impacts for 2019. But let's review the longer-term implications of the divestiture summarized in slide number 17. Longer term, this divestiture should have a positive impact on our long-term growth and return on invested capital. Firstly, these are businesses that have not been resourced as much as many of our other categories and brands and have declined in recent years. Divesting them adds to our underlying growth profile. Similarly, because these businesses collectively generated lower margins than our portfolio average, divesting them adds to our margin profile.","There's also a benefit of simplifying our portfolio and our supply chain. We can reduce complexity with this divestiture offering opportunities for efficiencies. We can also better focus resources on our biggest and most profitable brands.","And finally, by using the proceeds to pay down debt, we can enhance our financial flexibility. This puts us in a better position to take advantage of higher-return opportunities to invest. So there're some very clear long-term benefits from making this transaction.","In summary, we feel good about our financial position coming out of Q1. We're making good progress on top line growth with our biggest brands and our emerging markets leading the way. We're starting to generate the price realization needed to offset cost inflation and we are taking steps to mitigate the margin drag of our On the Go price -- pack formats in the U.S.","Our Q1 puts us right on track towards our original pre-divestiture guidance, both for the first half and for the full year. And there's nothing new to our full year guidance, nor to the expected dilution from the divestiture. We're on strategy and on plan.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Steve who will discuss the performance of each of our regions.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, Fareed. Among the many signs that Deploy for Growth is gaining traction is the fact that our improvement in top line performance is broad-based. As shown on slide number 19, each of our four regions is showing undeniable improvement. Yes, North America was still down in Q1, but we've explained the unusual factors that caused that: write-offs related to the RXBAR recall, which is behind us and the shipment timing in U.S. Cereal. Even with these factors, North America is clearly progressing toward a return to growth.","And look at the three international regions. Europe accelerated its growth despite some very difficult developed markets. And Latin America and AMEA, home to most of our expanding emerging markets businesses, both sustained the recent accelerated momentum.","Let's look at each region in turn. Let's start with North America in slide number 20. We knew Q1 could be challenging, because of everything we were implementing in the quarter. For example, we moved into a completely new North America organizational design at the beginning of the year.","Recall that this included the elimination of standalone business units, reshaping in a specific category team supported by total North America sales, supply chain and support functions. This flatter and more focused organization will improve our agility going forward.","Another major initiative, we launched the first phase of a pack size harmonization in cereal. This required working down inventories of the previous packs and getting the new ones on shelf. This isn't easy, but it will improve shop-ability in the aisle and our ability to cross-promote brands.","And thirdly, we were in the midst of a product recall for RXBARs. You may remember that this was related to a third-party supplier and an ingredient that contained a potentially undeclared peanut allergen. We initiated the recall in December and then added SKUs in Q1, resulting in more write-offs flowing through net sales and delaying our restocking of shelves.","The good news is that we made good progress and worked through these headwinds, as well as some trade inventory reduction in cereal delivering only modest declines in net sales and operating profit. Importantly, we launched our largest wave of innovation in several years, the outcome of investing in our capabilities and pipeline. We also implemented various revenue growth management actions that began to restore our positive price realization even in Q1. And we delivered good sales and profit growth in specialty channels and in Canada.","Let's take a closer look at each of our major category groupings in North America. We'll start with the biggest, snacks, shown on slide number 21. I mentioned the RXBAR recall. It was an unfortunate event, but we're proactively ensuring quality control with our suppliers. The good news is that RXBARs are back on shelf and the latest four-week data shows ACV back above 70%, where it was prior to the recall and consumption up nearly 30% year-on-year. So this should be behind us.","Excluding the recall impact, our North America snack net sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate year-on-year. Driving this strong growth is the momentum we've sustained in our biggest brands. Deploy for Growth has us executing stronger brand building and innovation for these world-class brands, as well as growing our On the Go formats to win occasions.","Look at the strong consumption growth rates of these revitalized top five snacks brands. Pop-Tarts returned to growth in the second half of 2018. And in Q1, we launched a new Bites line which is off to a great start. Cheez-It accelerated its growth and its new Snap'd line is off to a good start as well.","Rice Krispies Treats continues to grow, augmented by its new Poppers offering and aided by newly added capacity. And Pringles continues to grow even on top of its year ago acceleration with new Wavy also off to a good start. We've talked a lot in recent quarters about how we aim to correct our under-indexing in On the Go offerings, like immediate consumption packs and multi and variety packs of single serve items.","The chart here shows that our growth in these pack formats has continued to accelerate, even as we have taken actions to shore up their margins. So our North America snacks has underlying momentum. It's important to note that the top five brands shown in this slide account for more than 60% of our measured channels snacks consumption. So their revitalization and growth is a very important sign that we can grow this business.","Now let's talk about cereal shown on slide number 22. We're disappointed by the start we had in North America Cereal. As I mentioned we knew the transition of certain brands to the harmonized pack sizes would create some initial softness particularly as we held off promoting those brands.","In fact during the first two weeks of January, our consumption was down 6%, but it was down only about 1% for the rest of the quarter in line with the category during those remaining weeks. While our consumption trend didn't change much overall our shipments definitely lagged in the quarter suggesting a reduction in trade inventory. While sizable and fairly sudden this quarter, it's not uncommon to experience these timing differences. This is probably more related to previous quarter's timing differences, rather than to any new trend.","Among our brands, Special K had a very soft quarter. We knew it was lapping strong promotional activity in last year's Q1. It turned out to be the only one of our core six brands to lose share in Q1. And excluding this one brand, our overall consumption was flat and our share increased by 20 basis points.","Outside of Special K, our adult-oriented brands gained share, thanks to our efforts to emphasize simple health and other wellness attributes. Corn Flakes had another great quarter. And Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats also continued to rebound. We launched Happy Inside, a unique cereal that offers the digestive health benefits of having prebiotics, probiotics and fiber all in one great tasting cereal. This will be a gradual launch, but it gives you a glimpse into how we are thinking about next-generation wellness trends.","In the Taste\/Fun segment, our big Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops brands held share amidst heightened competitive activity, and we launched some promising innovation notably Pop-Tarts Cereal, Strawberry Rice Krispies and Honey Nut Frosted Flakes each of which is off to a good start. We recognize that we have work to do to stabilize our cereal business, but we are making important changes and there are signs of progress.","So let's conclude our North America discussion with our frozen foods shown on slide number 23. Frozen net sales were off about 1% year-on-year, but that compares against a year ago quarter in which its growth had accelerated to a strong double-digit growth both in net sales and consumptions.","We're pleased that Eggo posted consumption growth in Q1 on top of that strong year earlier gain. We continued to grow our highly successful Thick & Fluffy premium waffle line. We grew our pancake business and we have exciting news with innovation on our core kid offerings. We will look to build on this momentum in Q2 with two exciting launches, a new higher protein offering called Off the Grid and a brand-new Thick & Fluffy French toast line.","Morningstar Farms is also lapping very tough comps. Innovation and good commercial execution is growing our business on the chicken-oriented segment. And we have more planned protein news and communication to come. We feel good about our frozen business. So overall North America did run into some headwinds in the first quarter, but the underlying business continues to improve.","Let's now talk about Europe shown on slide number 24. Europe's consistent growth continued in Q1 with revenue growth management improving our price realization and good volume growth led by snacks. Pringles had an exceptional quarter. As you can see, we're well past comparing against the disruptions we had in early 2017 with the brand returning to solid growth on top of growth.","Driving this growth has been a very effective marketing campaign around gaming as well as the launch of Rice Fusion, a rice-based crisp with Asian-inspired flavors that is exceeding our expectations. We also returned our wholesome snacks business to growth. Transforming this business was a priority for us this year, and we've gotten off to a better start than we anticipated. Driving this turnaround are Special K behind new protein offerings Rice Krispies Squares in the U.K. and the launch of Extra brand granola bars in Russia.","We also continue to expand our natural W.K. Kellogg brand into wholesome snacks. Our cereal sales continued to show the moderation of declines we realized in 2018, down only about 1% in Q1. The decrease was isolated in the challenging U.K. and France markets, despite good performance by focused brands like Extra, Crunchy Nut and Krave\/Tresor. The good news is that we grew cereal sales virtually everywhere else in the region.","An important element of our strategy is expanding our business in the emerging markets of Russia and Central Europe. Russia net sales in Q1 again grew at a strong double-digit rate both in cereal and in snacks. In cereal our consumption in Russia was up over 20%, gaining two points of share aided by the introduction of Extra brand granola. So we're pleased with our start in Europe and our progress on key strategic priorities.","We also had another good quarter in Latin America as shown on slide number 25. Growth was again led by Mexico, our biggest market in this region. Mexico cereal consumption growth continued to accelerate as shown on this chart and we continued to gain share behind strong commercial programs effective in-store execution and continued expansion in high-frequency stores.","In Brazil, there is no question that the 2016 acquisition of Parati was a game changer for us. This business continues to pose strong net sales, consumption growth and share growth across not only biscuits, but also powder juices and other categories. And it's helping us expand the rest of our portfolio in high-frequency stores.","Across the region, Pringles continues to pose strong growth. Argentina is a relatively small market for us overall, but it is an important market for Pringles and the economic and currency situation there certainly was a headwind. But we grew the brand in Latin America despite that, up double-digit outside Argentina. We had some incremental investments in Q1, so the region's profit decline this quarter was only timing related. Latin America remains in a good position to continue to drive growth for the company.","Now let me turn it over to Amit for one final review of AMEA. Amit?","Amit Banati","Thanks, Steve. Let me first state how excited I am for the opportunity to succeed Fareed as CFO. Fareed has done a great job and he leaves the company in solid financial condition. It has been a pleasure working with him, and I'm sure all of you have enjoyed working with him as well. I'll be working closely with him, during our transition over the next couple of months. And I look forward to meeting all of you in the coming weeks and months as well.","So let's finish our Q1 review with our Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa business shown on slide number 26. As you know, our Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey operations which we call MENAT will move out of Kellogg Europe and into this region. This consolidates all of our Africa businesses under a single leadership, and what an exciting opportunity Africa is for us.","Our MENAT business posted double-digit growth in quarter one driven by growth in cereal, biscuits, and noodles. In West Africa, our operations with partner Tolaram continue to expand. Multipro, the West African distributor whose results are consolidated into us continued to grow at a double-digit clip in Q1. And not included in AMEA's net sales or operating profit, but equally exciting is the continued growth of Dufil the noodles manufacturer in West Africa and the very strong growth in our joint ventures that manufacture and market Kellogg's brand of cereals, snacks and noodles.","Pringles continued its consistent growth growing at a mid-single-digit rate even before including the year-on-year growth of MENAT. With MENAT's growth our region's Pringles net sales accelerated to a strong double-digit gain across the region in quarter one. The drivers of this growth remain strong commercial execution, geographic expansion and the expansion of more affordable pack sizes. And we should mention Australia the most developed market in this region. Australia's net sales were up in quarter one with good growth in Pringles. And even excluding Pringles, we grew in Australia continuing to show how we can stabilize and grow cereal consumption in a very developed market.","So another strong performance by AMEA and with the portfolio and geographic expansion we are doing in a region right with population growth and economic upside AMEA is going to be a growth driver for Kellogg for a very long time.","And now, I'll turn it back over to Steve to wrap-up.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, Amit. Let me finish with slide number 28. As I said at the outset of this call, we remain on strategy and on plan. During Q1, we continued to take major actions to improve the trajectory of our company from reorganizing our biggest region to shifting resources and enhancing capabilities, from continuing to invest in the revitalization of our biggest brands, to continuing to expand our reach and portfolio in emerging markets. We even took another major step in our efforts to reshape our portfolio with the agreement to divest our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses. We are confident that these great brands and the talented employees that manage them are going to an outstanding new home in Ferrero.","And we come out of Q1 on plan. Our top line improved despite some temporary headwinds and we have every reason to believe it will continue to improve. Our profit performance keeps us on track for our full year guidance. This guidance does not change nor does the impact of the pending divestiture, which we disclosed back in early April.","Deploy for Growth is working. Our portfolio is being shaped towards growth. Our brands are revitalized. Our capabilities are being enhanced. And we're becoming that much more competitive in the marketplace. As always, I salute our employees for their dedication and hard work to make all this happen, during a period of incredible change. Our people truly are our competitive advantage.","And finally, we wish Fareed the very best in all of his next adventures and we welcome Amit to his new role.","And with that, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grandet","Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for the opportunity. I'd like to focus on SG&A. Significant improvement in SG&A in this quarter despite you saying last quarter you will continue to invest significantly behind your brands. So how should we understand the first quarter performance? Is it just a phasing of marketing investment that has been pushed later in the year? Could you please give us more color here for the quarter and how we should think about SG&A going forward? Thank you.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. And thank you for the question. I'll start and maybe Fareed will build on it. From an SG&A perspective it's important to note a couple of things. First, on a currency neutral basis SG&A was down about 2% year-over-year, so currency did help there. Brand building was also down year-over-year. As you'll recall, we were lapping nearly a $50 million increase that we put into the first quarter of last year. And so we are lapping that. We also delayed some brand building investment, particularly for RX during its recall because you don't want to be advertising against empty shelves, for example and also some capacity-constrained items in snacks and frozen, as well as the SKU changes that we are undertaking in cereal.","Overhead increased mainly because of the Multipro consolidation and we continue to invest in capabilities such as RGM e-commerce integrated business planning as well as the RX international expansion. But I close that by saying we feel good about our brand building investment overall again, lapping the big increase from the last quarter pushing some of that into later in the year. And in general, we feel good about our SG&A performance as well as the brand building levels of investment that we have currently and in the plan.","Laurent Grandet","Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thank you very much. Thank you for your call. This is -- kind of a question on gross margin. I don't think historically you guided gross margin, but obviously the gross margin is a large piece of the year first half second year -- I mean first half, second half, sorry. So as Multipro comes out after April the single serve piece is supposed to keep an eye on things shipped out kind of after Q2. Do we -- should we be expecting a stabilization in the gross margin as we get to the back half?","Or is it -- or the other buckets the growth-related bucket could that still potentially pressure the gross margin? And the reason why I ask Steve just to keep it simple is really obviously operating profit is still flat on the guide. You're investing up in the business, which is likely the right thing to be doing. But that gross margin piece, obviously, over a very long period of time much before you arrived has kind of continued to drift down. I just want to make sure the line of sight is that gross margin has actually improved at some point.","Fareed Khan","Yes, it's Fareed. Let me take that Rob. So we expect sequential improvement in gross margin as we go through the year and there are several drivers of that that will come together. Let me just walk you through the main moving parts. The first is that we initiated revenue growth management actions, sort of, Q4 - Q1 and we expect that to flow through as we get into Q2. And there is evidence of that as you see in our price\/mix.","The second thing is as we go deeper in the year some of the year-over-year cost inflation that we saw starts to lap and that will be less pressure on that sort of ongoing cost inflation bucket that we have. You mentioned the mechanical impact of Multipro. We've got one more month of that in the quarter. And on an ongoing basis, we will see a little bit of emerging markets mix. We've got a much more focused emerging market strategy. We're putting bets on specific markets. But as those businesses build scale we'll see margin improvement over the longer term.","And the last thing is single serve and we've always talked about how we can take some short-term things around single serve. We love the growth. We love the market opportunity. It's an under-indexed area for us. But the real fix is to the profit flow-through of that business is going to come from some of the supply chain changes. And as you know we put those initiatives in place. We put CapEx up against those. But that's really going to be a second half impact. So you kind of put all those dynamics together you get a line of sight around an improving gross margin picture as you go through the year and it's sort of a good exit rate.","Rob Dickerson","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. I guess I just want to follow up on Rob's question. I don't think you answered his question on whether or not you would expect gross margins to become stable or up as we progress through the year. I heard you loud and clear on sequential improvement but is this sequential improvement into growth?","Fareed Khan","Yes. I mean margins are going to be improving as we go through the year and we will see some growth come in yes.","Steve Cahillane","You should anticipate us by the end of the year exiting the year with growth in gross margin.","Jason English","Excellent. Thank you very much for that. And then I want to come back to cereal real quick. I appreciate some of the turbulence early on with some of your pack size reconfigurations. As we're looking in the data just like -- which we recognize there's ample imperfections there a lot of your share weakness and frankly some of the category's weakness suggest it could be due to promotional intensity. Promoted sales are down a lot.","I suspect that that reflects a slightly more subdued level of merchandising out there. As you work your way through this transition should we expect the promotional intensity or the merchandising intensity behind the category to improve? So do you think-- are you expecting this to be an enabler of not only your market share improvement but hopefully some of the category trend improvement as well?","Steve Cahillane","Yes, Jason what I'd tell you is a couple of things. As we went through this whole transition, we essentially de-prioritized promotions in the first couple of weeks of the year obviously because we were going through this transition. And that's where we saw our steepest drop. You should expect to see a return to what I would call normal in terms of promotion activity and merchandising effectiveness as we continue to go through the transition.","Jason English","And what is the timing there? You mentioned this is first phase. Do we have another phase? So in other words, could this transition -- how long does the net transition span?","Steve Cahillane","Into the middle of the year, and so we've done our adult portfolio. We'll do our kid\u2019s portfolio next -- other way around sorry. We did our kids portfolio first, we'll do our adult portfolio later. And so there\u2019ll be some turbulence but we learned a lot going through the first phase that we'll apply into the second phase.","Jason English","Helpful. Thank you so much guys.","Operator","Excuse me. The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Fareed Khan","Good morning.","Steve Cahillane","Good morning, Alexia","Alexia Howard","Hi. So, can I stick with this question of pricing dynamics in North America? The -- and it may be to do with the promotional changes calendar that you just described. But the on-shelf pricing is over 3% in on-shelf measured channels in North America across the portfolio, and yet you did only see about 0.2% price\/mix improvement in North America. If retail has continued to manage some of these products with faster on-shelf price growth than you're able to realize, how the volume trends improve if you're having to paddle against those higher on-shelf prices?","And I guess linked to that just a quick question on cereals, are you seeing any destocking in cereals? We've heard that from other companies as part of the reason that the shipments were behind the takeaway on the cereal side? Thank you.","Steve Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks for the question Alexia. A couple of things. First I'll tell you, our Q1 price realization in North America was blurred by the RXBAR recall, which was about one full point in pricing. So you\u2019d expect to see something above 1 closer to 1.2 without that.","The other thing is in cereal and the rest of the portfolio, we did take pricing in Q4 and Q1. We're expecting that to flow through essentially in Q2. Not much flow through or not as much flow-through in Q1 based on protecting promotions and things that are very standard in terms of you take a price but you have promotional activity booked in the first quarter. So you should see that happening.","And the last part of your question. If you look back over time both from a average number of SKUs and ACV weighted distribution there has been virtually no change in cereal for the last several years.","And then one additional point in terms of trade inventory, we did see a reduction in trade inventory for cereal, which we're expecting not to be a trend but it looks to be kind of a one-off. So hopefully that answers your question.","Alexia Howard","So in terms of the retailer on the shelf pricing, do you have control over that, or are you aware that that's taking pricing up more quickly, or is that just not a concern?","Steve Cahillane","We do not control retail pricing. We never have. And retailers it's up to themselves. But we have -- you will see us having more price realization flowing through our P&L in the second quarter and beyond.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Steve Cahillane","Hi, good morning.","Fareed Khan","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just wanted to ask a quick question a bit of a follow-on. With SG&A being down in the quarter, as I was just thinking back to some of your commentary from the fourth quarter call, you did have a -- you talked about like a heavier innovation pipeline in the first half of the year. I guess I'm trying to understand, is there more marketing made press to come in the second quarter as part of your investment behind these new products?","If I could just add to that, as you make investments in capabilities and that kind of thing and those were heavier expenses second half of last year, and those would theoretically flow through this year, are those more SG&A or cost of goods sold? And where are those investments falling? Are those kind of in line with what you're expecting?","Steve Cahillane","Yeah. I'll start and I'll let Fareed build. We do have good support around some of our innovation launches and we feel very good about that. If you look at just a couple of them Cheez-It Snap'd, Pop-Tarts Bites both over close to 60% ACV distribution with velocities greater than their categories. So the support that we're putting behind them is clearly working.","The biggest change in SG&A as I mentioned was pushing out some of the RX spend into later in the year due to the recall. We do continue to invest in capabilities, a lot around RGM, a lot around business planning and that should continue throughout the year. But when we look at our overall brand building levels as I mentioned earlier we feel good that the very significant step-up that we started in 2017 and into 2018 puts it at about the right base level in terms of what we should expect going forward.","We want to maintain our agility as we go forward. But we see good support around the investments that we're making in innovation and we're seeing that very successfully in the marketplace.","Fareed Khan","And the only thing I'd add is that investments against the brands, we're taking a very nimble approach. So we can -- we like what we're seeing with the big brands and the in-market performance. And so we can react when RXBAR recall for example and pivot some of that investment.","We also have through Project K and through some of the organizational changes that we've talked about in North America savings coming through. And that's what's allowing us to fuel some of the reinvestments the logistics team gave. And I'd also add to that analytics and digital and an international RX expansion as well.","Chris Growe","And so would you expect SG&A to be down? I guess from the statements last year it sounds like it should be down again this year even with some spending being up. Is that correct?","Fareed Khan","Well, I'd put that in the context of our overall guidance and we'll continue to see savings come through. We'll make targeted investments brand building. There's a little bit of phasing there. But I think generally this -- I think first half second half may be pretty close to how we framed the full year before the recall.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. I'm going to try to sneak in two questions. One is when we take a look at second quarter; I think you said that you would shift some of your investment spending out of first and into second. How should we think about earnings and profit growth as a result in the second quarter? Will it be down versus year ago?","And then a broader question about spending at the retailers. In your brand building do you include the money that you give to retailers for digital commerce and the omnichannel kind of efforts that they have the advertising on those omnichannel efforts? I understand that the retailers are pushing harder and harder for more resources in that regard. Thanks.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. So, as we said in the prepared remarks, Rob, much of the brand building will be shifted into Q2, right? So, you should think about the guidance that we've given in terms of first half, second half as remaining the same.","In terms of the way we spend with retailers for competitive reasons, we're not going to get too much into the detail. But retailer data if it's good data, we will engage with them right? And so we are looking always at the ROI of our spend.","And if you look at some of the retailers with excellent data and I mean consumer shopper data, you combine that with -- or shopper data combined with our consumer data, one plus one can really equal three. So, I'd look at it as the continued digitization of the opportunity to engage with consumers. And where we can make good investments, we'll make those good investments but it will be our choices.","Fareed Khan","And just to build on sort of the operating profit sort of outlook for the year without getting to specific quarters that whole gross margin conversation that we had I think is very applicable to this topic as well with the caveat of sort of the brand building which is kind of a Q1-Q2 dynamic. But if you go back to that old dialogue about gross margin, that's sort of the similar shape to OP as well.","Robert Moskow","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thank you. Fareed, best of luck to you. Thanks for all your help.","Fareed Khan","Thank you, Ken.","Ken Goldman","And Steve you said Special K had a very soft quarter. I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on your thoughts on this brand which I think was supposed to be doing much better by now. Was the corporate weakness a little bit of an anomaly, or is it something where you're actually rethinking the strategy that you're applying to it at this point?","Steve Cahillane","Thanks for the question Ken. I wouldn't say we're rethinking the strategy so much. As we were lapping a very, very strong promotion in the quarter -- first quarter of 2018 we decided not to put that level of investment against it. We still have work to do on Special K in the United States. We are learning from some of the successes we've had in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom around Special K to get that brand to stabilization.","But we think about the opportunities in cereal as a total portfolio. And so as if you look at some of the other adult -- I mean consumption on Corn Flakes was up nearly 22% in the quarter, Raisin Bran was up almost 5%, Mini-Wheats was up almost 1%. And so we're making good progress in a number of our big brands. And we still have to fix Special K and we're bound and determined that we will do it. But we have to think about portfolio investments and getting the most out of our cereal business and that includes all of our brands.","Ken Goldman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey good morning everyone. I'm going to try to just get one clarification and then a question. On other income Fareed, I guess, we're still guiding for it to be down because of the value of the pension assets. But with the markets up as much as they are is there a chance that that will get re-measured at some point and potentially be less of a drag?","Fareed Khan","Yes. Unfortunately we measure once a year and that's the end of Q4 measurement. And those assumptions on the returns stick for the full year and then we'll re-measure it again. So, it's a fixed assumption as we go through. Now, as we re-measure it, that will have a different dynamic.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thanks. And then Steve just a bigger question. There's been a lot of energy around the plant-based meat alternatives recently. We've got a couple of new -- a couple of companies that are really emerging with I guess next-generation products. So, as you look at Morningstar and you evaluate I guess the market opportunities, is there a potential that you'll begin to maybe look to flex more resources there as a way to enter that market as it evolved?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks Brian. It clearly is an exciting category. It's been much in the news. We're excited about where Morningstar Farms is. As I mentioned on the prepared remarks, we've got a lot happening in chicken, but we see a lot of opportunity to do things beyond that.","And for competitive reasons, I wouldn't get much into that except to underscore what you said it's an exciting space. It's a space where we feel like we have the right to win. You've heard us talk about our sales being kind of the original plant-based protein company. We believe that. And so we'll continue to innovate in that space and I would just say watch the space.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Priya Ohri-Gupta","Hi thank you so much for the question and Fareed, best of luck. Just a quick question on the debt paydown comments, using the divestiture proceeds. So hoping you could give us some context as to how to think about prioritization in using those proceeds.","You do have some maturities later this year. Would those be sort of first and foremost, or would you look to perhaps bring down some of the higher coupon debt that you have to help with interest expense? Thanks.","A \u2013 Fareed Khan","Yeah. So many of those factors would go into our thinking, as you know, we've got some maturities that are coming up in the near term. But we would look across the entire profile and make those best choices.","I won't give any specific tranches that we would or wouldn't go after. But it's a balanced approach and optimizing both maturities and interest. All that would factor into our decisions.","Q \u2013 Priya Ohri-Gupta","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 David Driscoll","Great thank you and good morning.","A \u2013 Fareed Khan","Good morning, David.","Q \u2013 David Driscoll","Fareed, I want to say thanks for all your help. And Amit welcome to the new job. I wanted to ask a little bit -- again just a clarification on divestitures and then a question about the, On the Go snacks.","The divestitures I think you presented information that it's 4% to 5% dilutive this year, but it's just a partial year. But then in another slide the full 12-month dilution stays at just 5%. ","I assume this relates to the timing and the use of the proceeds. But can you just clarify here? Just on the surface the numbers are the same even though it's only what five, six months dilutive or -- gone this year whereas a full the full 12 months next year.","A \u2013 Fareed Khan","Yeah. So you're right David, its Fareed. So it's more of an impact in 2019. And it's really those dynamics around the -- as the business goes, the costs that stay the transaction support for the buyer for the business and that all factors into it. So, you're right, in terms of the way that's weighted across 2019 and into 2020.","Q \u2013 David Driscoll","All right, the follow-up question or the main question is just on the On the Go. Obviously, last year you had a surprise on the margin structure of that business. And I think your comments about gross margins are probably a portion of the answer.","But I want to be real specific here. Are you on track for the in-sourcing of these On the Go products? And Steve, I just like you to comment. You've got all these new products in snacks. You've got the size change going on in cereal in North America. And you've got the in-sourcing of all these On the Go products.","There's just a lot of complexity. And for me, this is an executional question for the organization. How do you feel about all these things happening? And then specifically, are we on track for the On the Go in-sourcing?","A \u2013 Steve Cahillane","Yeah, David Thanks. The short answer to your question yes we are. In Q1 and Q2, it's really about SKU rationalization and revenue growth management. In Q3 and Q4, it's around centralized packing sites getting opened and so therefore repatriating volume inside.","And so we are very confident that we have a gross margin path towards this. This is part of it, but an important part of it where I said we exit the year on a path towards gross margin growth. So, the answer to the question is yes. And we continue to see outstanding growth as you saw on one of the slides in those On the Go packs.","In terms of overall like the innovation and the complexity and all the things that we're doing we feel very confident about that. And if I just -- I threw out some numbers before but if you look at just the consumption in the United States in Q1 on the big brands that we're investing against and innovating around, Pop-Tarts was up 14%, Cheez-It was up over 12%, Rice Krispies Treats was up 8%, Pringles was up over 4%, and so forth and so on.","So, these are the brands that we said we're going to invest in around our Deploy for Growth strategy. These are the brands that have the On the Go pack formats. And these are the brands that have the new big innovations. And it's working. It's working in the marketplace.","And therefore we're going to continue to focus on that. And it's not about proliferation. It's about innovating around the big brands, from a pack format but also from an innovation food format. And we feel good about what that's giving us in the marketplace.","Q \u2013 David Driscoll","Thanks for all the detail.","A \u2013 John Renwick","Operator, I think we only have time for one last question.","Operator","And that question will come from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Eric Larson","Yeah. Thank you everyone. And Good luck to you Fareed as well as Amit. Looking forward to working with you now as well. So Steve, it's a follow-up question here that I have. It's again on snack which is really working for you. And you're a bigger snacking company today than you're a cereal company and so this is important.","And the goal of changing your DSD was to free up the resources the marketing resources, so that you can invest against the brands. And I think you sort of lapped -- I think mid-part of last year you finally lapped all of that conversion process.","So my question is you talked about spending all -- are we still looking at a significant year-over-year increase in let's say your advertising\/promotional investment in North America snacks? Are we halfway through that and this year is still.","I'm just trying to gauge the great sustainability you've got here of the top line momentum.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks for the question, Eric. We have fully lapped the DSD transition and that includes the investments that we shifted from DSD capability into brand building. And so, as I said before, we are going to maintain our agility, but we feel like we have the right levels of investment against the right brands. And it's working in the marketplace. It's showing good consumption growth against those brands that I just rattled off and you can look at the same Nielsen numbers we look at when you look at things like conversion of feature and display.","We feel good about the way we're executing in the marketplace in a post-DSD world. So fully lapped right levels, more or less of brand building against those brands and good execution in the marketplace and the consumption is showing that it's working.","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you.","John Renwick","Operator, I think that's all we have time for.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks.","John Renwick","Thanks, everyone, for your interest. And I am around all day so give me a call.

Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In a quarter that was unusually challenging across our industry, we're disappointed with the start to our year on top-line growth. There were essentially three drivers of this slow start, as we had mentioned previously. First, we experienced an expected reduction in trade inventory due to early shipments in Q4 in various categories in the U.S. and from the timing of shipments related to distributor transitions in a handful of international markets. We should be largely past these impacts.","Secondly, we did encounter some customer-specific interruptions in Q1, mostly related to price-pack changes we are making on Pringles to cover input costs, product reformulations and currency. These negotiations have been resolved, though their impact could linger a bit into Q2 as we ramp back up normal orders and promotional activity in these accounts.","Thirdly, and most importantly, like virtually every packaged food company, we experienced a suddenly lower consumption trend across all categories in the U.S. This was the continuation of long-term trends, exacerbated by some transitory issues, such as holiday timing and delays in tax refunds. In our business, we saw the worst of it in January, moderating but still soft in February, and then in March and April showing signs of returning to the run rates we saw in Q4 and full year 2016 adjusted for Easter timing. Shipments, too, seemed to normalize in March and April.","Even despite this disappointing top-line, we still managed to grow currency-neutral profit and earnings. Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting continue to deliver savings as planned and we generated positive price\/mix. We expect margin expansion to continue. This is what gives us confidence that we remain on track to deliver on our profit, earnings and cash flow guidance.","Meanwhile, we are confident that our top-line performance will improve in coming quarters. We'll be past some of the discrete factors that affected shipments in Q1. We are already seeing signs of improvement in consumption trends, and we have stronger commercial plans. That said, the longer-term trends we have seen over the past couple of years are still with us. We are addressing these trends, making sure we are getting our consumers what they want, when they want and where they want to purchase it. This is the essence of our 2020 Growth Plan, and we're making good progress against it.","Slide 4 highlights some 2020 Growth Plan elements that directly address the longer-term trends that have been weighing down consumption for packaged foods companies and we made progress in all these areas during Q1. We renovated food and packaging to be more on-trend. This is what will get us out in front of today's trends. Q1 saw Kashi Company return to growth in cereal share and consumption, while launching new and renovated snacks. We also launched a portfolio of new and renovated Special K bars. We renovated Eggo to eliminate artificial colors and flavors.","We're building capabilities required for reaching today's multi-channel shopper. We need to find the consumer wherever he or she is shopping. In Q1, we had another quarter of growth in our Specialty Channels business. We continue to build capability and momentum in e-commerce and in high-frequency stores all around the world. And our recently-announced transition out of DSD, which served one particular channel, is specifically intended to free up resources that can be reinvested for the benefit of more brands across all channels. That transition got off to a good start in Q1.","We're expanding in emerging markets. This is where we'll see better growth for a long time. In Q1, we generated organic growth in these markets. And we also saw continued expansion in our joint ventures, and we made good progress in integrating Parati in Brazil, a transformational acquisition for us in Latin America, and a business that is already posting strong growth. Over time, these actions will result in better presence and scale for us in markets that will outgrow developed markets.","And we continue to increase our operating profit margin. This not only supports our earnings power in a growth-charged environment, but it helps to offset headwinds and creates fuel for future growth. Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting continue to generate expected savings. Gross margin continues to improve sequentially and operating profit margin continues to improve as well. Returning to profitable top-line growth is a must for us. And while Q1 feels like a step back from a net sales standpoint, we did continue to make progress.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Fareed who will walk you through the financials.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 offers a brief summary of our financial results for Q1. While we had a disappointing quarter from a net sales perspective, our savings and efficiency programs were strong enough to grow operating profit on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Below operating profit, we were able to reduce interest expense and other financial costs while substantially increasing our earnings from joint ventures, which are growing strongly.","Our favorable effective tax rate was expected in Q1, driven by a previously-disclosed tax benefit related to intra-company brand assets between subsidiaries. I would note that after Q1, our effective tax rate moves back up to higher levels for the remaining quarters and finishes the year higher than 2016, as previously guided. We finished Q1 with earnings per share growth that keeps us on track for our full-year expectations.","Let's go into a little bit more detail, starting with net sales. Slide 6 breaks our reported net sales performance into its components, so you can get a currency-neutral comparable basis. As you can see from the slide, our price\/mix continued to firm, contributing 130 basis points after being negative for much of 2016. It was volume that pulled down our net sales in the quarter.","As we mentioned back in February, we were expecting a slow start to the year, based on the three factors that John mentioned: a reduction in trade inventories; second, some customer interactions associated with the implementation of price-pack changes on Pringles, particularly in Europe that have since been resolved; and third, broad-based consumption softness in the U.S., particularly in January and February. Q1 was not the norm and we expect to see sequential improvement in Q2, with further improvement coming in the second half.","Slide 7 summarizes the key initiatives we have in place to drive our margins higher. The first four items on this slide are all well-accounted for under Project K, the largest restructuring program our company has ever undertaken. As you know, this program includes: Network Restructuring, which has included the closure of capacity, as well as investments in new capabilities; the move to a Global Business Services model; and Organizational Design work, which is also on track in generating savings. These efforts are global in scope and on track to deliver our projected benefits.","The most recent element of Project K addressing our Go-to-Market Model represents our recently-announced decision to exit from DSD. It's a little different than the other elements of Project K, in that it's specifically intended to both improve top-line growth for our U.S. Snacks business over time, while also improving margins. This initiative remains on track, as Paul will discuss shortly.","Finally, our Zero-Based Budgeting is delivering. It's in its second year in North America, where it's been embedded into the way we work and has been fully implemented in our international regions, and cost savings are being captured as expected. These initiatives strongly supported our profit and earnings in Q1 and will benefit margins and top-line growth in the future.","Slide 8 shows how we improved our profit margins in Q1. Gross profit margin posted another quarter of year-over-year improvement. This was driven by productivity and cost savings under Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting, and by favorable net input costs. These factors more than offset the impact of continuing to invest in our food and packaging, as well as the negative operating leverage of an unusually large decline in volume we saw for the quarter. On the operating profit margin, we continued to see strong expansion in Q1, not only because of the increase in gross margin, but also because of the efficiencies and savings initiatives. Importantly, this operating margin expansion was broad-based, with all four of our regions recording increases. So our margin expansion remains very much on track.","Also on track is our cash flow, as indicated on slide 9. In addition to higher net income, we continued to trim our core working capital as a percentage of sales, primarily through our efforts on payables. This year-over-year improvement in cash flow is strong, even when you exclude the year-ago impact of last year's bond tender. Our Q1 performance keeps us on track for our full-year cash flow target of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.","With that, let's turn to slide 10 and our latest guidance for the full year 2017. We are affirming our guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow, even as we soften our outlook for net sales.","The Q1 sales decline puts us behind the rate of our previous net sales guidance. And we are taking a prudent approach towards year-to-go consumption trends. So we think net sales growth for the full year is now more like a 3% decline. This doesn't alter our operating profit guidance, which we are affirming today. As we stated at CAGNY, we can deliver on a 7% to 9% operating profit growth, even if net sales decline 3% for the year. And we've identified additional opportunities that give us confidence in this outlook. Our earnings per share outlook is also affirmed, and this is both on a currency-neutral comparable basis, which is how we measure it, as well as on a comparable basis. And finally, we are also affirming our guidance on cash flow, as I mentioned.","While we don't offer specific guidance by quarter, I would like to take a moment to comment on the general shape of our earnings in 2017. We still believe operating profit growth will be weighted to the second half. Some of these quarterly phasing factors are described on slide 11. While we mentioned there are elements of Q1 that could linger into Q2, and specifically we are prudently assuming that it's going to take time for January and February's consumption trends to moderate, and we'll just be resuming normal shipments and promotional activities following negotiations with certain customers in Europe during Q1, but the largest driver of our second half weighting is the DSD transition. Simply put, there'll be some overlap between the reinvestment in our warehouse and brand-building and the cost of operating DSD during the Q2 and Q3 transition period. This is because we can't eliminate DSD costs until we have the bulk of our customers transitioned into the warehouse model. And, by and large, those savings will come in Q4.","In summary, Q1 was a slow start on the top-line, as we had indicated, but it didn't take us off course for earnings or cash flow. Much of our plan is weighted to the second half, with sales improving as we go along and savings related to the DSD exit coming late in the year. And our margin expansion programs continue to bear fruit, so we remain on track to achieve operating profit, EPS and cash flow guidance even with a softened top-line outlook.","To be clear, and to reiterate John's comment, bottom-line growth is not enough. We need to get back to top-line growth and that remains a key priority for us, even as we deliver on margin expansion.","So with that, I'd like to turn over the call to Paul Norman, our President of Kellogg North America.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Thanks, Fareed. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter was certainly a challenging one for Kellogg North America. We again delivered strong operating profit margin expansion. However, our top-line was not where we wanted it to be. John has already walked you through the unexpectedly soft consumption that was felt across our categories and across the entire industry. And, as he said, it appears that at least some of this was due to transitory factors that will not persist.","We also had a notable decrease in trade inventories. We knew that trade inventory would come out in Q1 and it did. During the quarter, we made good progress on productivity initiatives, investment in food and packaging and our DSD transition, which I'll come back to in a moment. And we had strong commercial plans across our businesses for Q2 and the second half, though I'm confident that our sales performance will improve.","Let's briefly walk through each business, starting with the ones whose results came in largely as expected, and then moving to Morning Foods and Snacks, where the factors I mentioned were most acute.","I'll start with Specialty Channels on slide 13. Our Specialty Channels business in Q1 delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth, even against a tough year-ago comparison. The net sales growth was delivered through equal parts of volume and price\/mix, and via market expansion in core channels, as well as expansion in emerging growth channels, all of which was aided by innovation. Operating profit margin continued to improve, driven by price, mix, as well as continued Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting savings. So we continue to feel good about Specialty Channels.","Now we'll look at our North America Other segment on slide number 14. As we expected, this segment posted strong 8% profit growth in Q1 with margins improving substantially, up 200 basis points on the strength of Project K and ZBB savings. In Frozen, Eggo consumption returned to growth in March. With the removal of artificial ingredients and solid commercial plans, we expect better net sales performance in coming quarters.","MorningStar Farms is a similar story. Consumption turned to growth in March and our renovated line is now on shelf and being supported. So that should get gradually better, too. At Kashi, trade inventory corrected, following innovation launches in late Q4. However, we continue to show good progress in our overhauled Cereal business, which continued to grow consumption in the natural channel and grew consumption in xAOC measured channels, too, with particularly encouraging gains for our bear naked brand. And we're just starting to get back on air with media. We launched our new Nut Butter Bars in January. Our early signs are good and we're following it up with further renovations and innovations in the second half. So Kashi is another business in which we expect to see gradual improvement as the year goes on, both in consumption and in net sales.","In Canada, we're still seeing the volume impact of our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover the steep transactional FX impact of a weakened Canadian dollar. We expect the impact to stabilize as we lap our pricing actions in the next couple of months. So Canada is on track to meet expectations for the year.","Now, let's turn to slide 15 and U.S. Morning Foods. Morning Foods' Q1 sales were affected by the category-wide consumption slowdowns in January and February, by trade inventory reductions coming out of Q4 and by the timing of our commercial plans. Performance across our core six brands was mixed. Our kid brands grew consumption and share behind a strong performance of Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the leading category innovation this year, and Froot Loops responded very well to its new Whatever Froots Your Loops campaign.","On the flipside, Special K and Mini-Wheats started the year in decline, largely due to the year-on-year timing of innovation and renovation. Last year, both had important activity in Q1. While this year, both are set to launch new and renovated offerings during Q2. We expect quarterly sequential improvement in sales for cereal and share, driven by continued momentum in our kid brands and by the renovation, innovation, and new communication for the Special K and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, which are breaking here in the month of May. We also have a major in-store event coming in late Q2 behind the movie release of Despicable Me 3.","Pop-Tarts in Q1 continued to gain share in toaster pastries, driven by the successful launch of new Pop-Tarts Dunkin' Donuts flavors. We'll continue to drive this brand hard in the back half of the year with the launch of JOLLY RANCHER-flavored Pop-Tarts. So we expect gradual improvement in Morning Foods' sales performance in the coming quarters, while OP margin expansion will continue.","Now, let's talk about U.S. Snacks shown on slide number 16. Snacks had a tough quarter for the consumption and trade inventory reasons we've mentioned previously. Additionally, but not unexpectedly, we also experienced some initial order softness during the few weeks in February when we were informing our DSD employees of our exit. These factors combined to pull down net sales and operating profit in the quarter. The good news is that we continue to gain share in Crackers, led by our Big 3 brands. And we saw newly-supported Keebler gain share in Cookies. We also sustained share growth momentum in another focused brand for us, Rice Krispies Treats.","So our underlying in-market business performance remains healthy. And we feel good about what's coming in our commercial plans for the rest of the year. We've already launched Special K Snacks in Q1 and still transitioning that on shelf, but that will help us stabilize that brand. As we transition out of DSD, we are ramping up brand-building support across key cracker brands, wholesome snack brands, and Pringles. Q2 will see support behind our innovations as well as in-store promotions around Major League Soccer and the tie-in to the movie, Despicable Me 3. And going into the second half, our plan strengthens further with innovations behind Cheez-It, the renovation of Nutri-Grain and new single-serve pack-form adds across multiple categories, all of this supported by the incremental brand-building that is a key element of our transition to our new Go-to-Market Model.","This brings me to another important development in the quarter, our progress against the DSD transition. This is graphically depicted on slide number 16 (sic) [17]. Transition planning is well underway, driven by a multi-functional team and led by individuals that orchestrated our successful integration of Pringles. Joint business planning with customers has gone well. And our retention of employees is on track. And we've made numerous other elements of progress against a host of operational elements.","So we feel very good about our progress so far. Portfolio optimization began in Q1 and will continue through the transition as we optimize the assortment for warehouse delivery and work down inventories. This will have an increasing impact on volume as the year goes on, but it facilitates the transitions this year and should contribute to a net improvement in velocity and profitability as we get into 2018. Customer transitions have begun, with the first of our customer base being converted here in Q2. This will trigger the first of the list price adjustments, which will have an increasing impact as more customers get converted across Q2 and Q3.","Keep in mind that we already have a fully-functioning warehouse system that is both efficient and scalable and is ready for this transition. Remember, though, most of DSD network will have to remain open through the transition. The final exit, including the final head count and DC reductions, will happen as the last of the customers gets converted during Q4. That's when you will see the true benefit of the savings begin to come forward at their ultimate run rate.","So in summary for Kellogg North America, our top-line performance across the region was affected by softened consumption across most categories in the U.S., as well as some shipment timing and some short-term issues that should be behind us. Commercial plans get stronger in Q2, and we are making good progress on the DSD transition. And we continue to deliver strong improvement in our operating profit margin.","With that, I'll turn it back to John for a look at the international regions.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Paul. Let's now turn to our international regions, starting with Europe on slide 18. We had a very difficult start to 2017 in Europe. The principal reason for our below-trend net sales performance in Q1 was Pringles. While our consumption held up reasonably well in the quarter, our shipments had an unusual downturn in Q1 because of some customer-specific interruptions as we sought to price behind our food and packaging upgrades, not to mention higher input costs and currency.","This took some time to negotiate with customers, particularly in the UK and France. Getting this done was important as it enables us to reinvest behind the brand. These negotiations have been resolved. So after some lingering impact and tough comparisons in Q2, we should see Pringles return to growth in the second half, particularly given its geographic expansion and stronger commercial plans.","I should point out that while net sales for our UK Cereal business declined year-on-year, we did post another quarter of sequential improvement. We also saw most of our biggest brands hold or gain share in the quarter, with Special K being the one we still have to stabilize.","Overall in Cereal, we expect to continue toward stabilization in the UK and deliver better performance in the rest of Europe. We have strong commercial plans in the developed markets, with an emphasis on Special K, featuring renovation, innovation, and media-supported repositioning. We also expect to sustain our momentum in emerging markets, like Russia and Arabia. Europe is likely to remain challenging over the foreseeable future and we still have a lot of work to do, but we should see sequential improvement as the year goes on.","Latin America is shown on slide 19. Sales in Latin America were off slightly, but solely because of distributor transitions in Central America and Peru. Excluding these transitions, our sales remained in growth. And this was led by good growth in Mexico, thanks to strong growth in high-frequency stores, a strategic priority for us, and solid consumption in our kid-oriented brands in cereal.","Across the region, we sustained strong momentum in Pringles, including double-digit growth in the Southern Cone and continued gains in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. The integration of Parati, another key priority for us this year, is going well. And Parati, itself, continued to post strong year-on-year growth in the quarter.","If we were to combine Parati's year-on-year growth on a pro forma basis with our currency-neutral comparable results, it would've added to our sales and profit growth in Latin America in the quarter. This is an exciting region for us, and we expect improved growth going ahead. We also expect margin expansion in Latin America to deliver an extremely strong improvement in Q1, putting it well on track to deliver margin expansion for the year.","We'll finish up our international discussion with Asia Pacific on slide 20. Asia Pacific posted improved sales growth in Q1 and very strong profit growth. In our biggest market, Australia, sales were off modestly year-on-year in the quarter, but this represented yet another quarter of good sequential improvement and we generated growth in consumption and share in Cereal.","In Asia, we generated high single-digit sales growth and this growth was broad-based. India is rebounding nicely from the impact of demonetization. And we are recording good growth in Southeast Asia, as well as Japan and Korea. Meanwhile, we continue to grow Pringles across the Asia Pacific region. In Q1, this was led by momentum and expansion of small cans in Korea, the successful launch of a popular new variety in Japan, helping us return to share growth in that market, and strong double-digit gains in emerging markets.","Outside of our consolidated net sales results, our joint ventures continue to perform extremely well in local currency. Both delivered strong double-digit growth again, with West Africa led by strong noodles volume and China more than doubling its e-commerce sales. Given their size and growth rates, if we were to add our share of the JVs' year-on-year sales growth, we'd be talking about double-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth for Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is another region that is very much on track to deliver on its projected sales and profit growth in 2017, and is important to the company's overall growth profile going forward.","So now I'm going to summarize with slide 21. It is an unusual time for large packaged food companies, more than ever underscoring the importance of our 2020 Growth Plan and our margin expansion target. Our Q1 got off to a slow start, as we had mentioned it would back in February, and as other companies have experienced. We are disappointed by this top-line performance, but we do believe much of the headwinds are behind us, and remain committed to doing what we have to do in order to sequentially improve this performance near-term, and ultimately returned to top-line growth.","We remain on our profit, earnings, and cash flow guidance for the year, a testament to the strength of our productivity initiatives. We are making good progress on our 2020 Growth Plan. In Q1, that was evident in our growth in emerging markets, in our expansion in emerging channels, our launch of on-trend food and packaging, and even our progress on exiting DSD.","And finally, we continue to improve our currency-neutral comparable operating profit margin with good visibility to our 2018 goals. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and determination in making us a stronger Kellogg Company.","And with that, we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. I was hoping I could ask a little bit about the inventory reductions that you've seen in the trade, and maybe you could help me understand what the customers are doing here. Are they consciously just trying to improve their working capital or have you seen, I guess, distribution losses in different categories and geographies for your own business that necessitate lower inventory?","And then particularly in Kashi, I guess I thought Kashi was kind of improving. And then to see the inventory kind of cut back, maybe you could help me understand why that occurred?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Rob. Let me just talk about the company at a macro level, and then I'll let Paul jump in with anything he might want to add on North America. Clearly, inventory had an impact on our first quarter top-line growth. And if I just sort of give you a sense of the impact, we were down about 4% on organic sales in Q4. That breaks into four different buckets. 1% is the underlying consumption trend line that we had across 2016. About 1% is the softer consumption from January, February. About 1% is the trade inventory question that you've asked. And another point was the impact of Pringles pack-price architecture and some customer disputes that disrupted our business in the quarter.","If I go specifically to your trade inventory question, so, again, that's about a one point impact on the consolidated results for Q1. We mentioned back on the fourth quarter call that we ended the fourth quarter with higher inventories than we would normally have. So we expected some of this to come out in Q1. It's fair to say we also ended Q1 with lower inventories than what we would normally have. Part of that could be, for example, in the Snacks business, where we are culling SKUs in preparation for the DSD transition.","What's not driving this is loss of distribution broadly in our categories. In fact, we have the same shelf presence and shelf footprint today as we had last year and the year prior. So we see a good stability in that area. I think this is a correction from higher inventories, and, quite frankly, we're at unusually lower inventories at the end of this quarter, which can give us some line of sight to additional sales as we go through the year. Paul, do you want to add anything?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Hey, Rob, Paul. Yeah, Kashi. I will come to Kashi in a second. If you look across Crackers, Cookies, Pop-Tarts, Cereal, Frozen, and Kashi, consumption was higher than our shipments in every case. Okay? So it really was a significant impact. Again, more granular on something like Kashi, there's a big disconnect in cereal, in particular, partly because of the selling in of innovation at the end of last year, which we knew drove some inventory in.","The good news is, is the consumption is exactly where, if not ahead of where we planned. So we're seeing that come through in the first quarter and will normalize now as we go forward into the second quarter.","I want to dig deeper and give you a little bit of color maybe on Snacks. Snacks was off, as you can see, by about 6%. Half of that, we think, is consumption-related broad-based trends in the marketplace. As I said, we grew share in Crackers. We grew share in the Keebler Cookie brand. Rice Krispies continues to do well. But the other half is things like the inventory decline, so planned SKU culls and a little bit of disruption around the, as John said, the transition as it relates to ordering, particularly in those two weeks when we spoke to our sales force about the future. So you can see this disconnect come through just about in every one of our businesses, it gives us the belief it's transitory and things will get better.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","One of your competitors is pretty open about expecting to see gains in shelf space and display activity because of your DSD exit in the second half. I'd just like to hear your thoughts on this. How do you minimize the disruption of this event? What do your retail partners tell you about what's going to happen to the shelf as you make that change? And then, just one related question to this whole thing, you mentioned about brand-building in snacks and starting to ramp on it. Could you just develop that a little bit more, and when should we start to expect to see significantly higher levels of brand-building for the snack operations?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Thanks, David. Here's how we see the status of the DSD transition. So far, everything is on track. And we're very happy with where we stand. If you step back, remember, what's driving this is a consumer and shopper-driven reason and a customer channel-driven reason. Part of the orientation away to a pull model is that we will shift significant resources to brand-building behind those, what I would call, invest-to-grow brands, particularly within Snacks, brands like Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, for example.","Our warehouse model is more effective and efficient. We already ship through warehouses. We deliver better service and higher in-stocks and it offers us better joint value creation with our customers as we come through on one platform.","As far as the shelf is concerned, we're deliberately leaning in to optimize our assortment, so we can make the shelf work harder. And so we are looking proactively to make sure that we have our fastest moving, biggest brands, where the investment is going to go, on shelf. We're not looking to lose space. We're looking to optimize our shelf so it can work harder. Within our customer discussions, so far, there is broad-based agreement that this is the future of delivery in these kinds of categories. And we're working through how we achieve it in the near-term. So we've had generally very good support for the move.","Specifically on brand-building, as I alluded to, you will see the brand-building ramp up here as we go through Q2, Q3, and Q4. It is really important as we go through this transition that we have strong plans in market to ensure shelf presence, display presence and we've got big things to sell behind. So as you look at our Snacks business year to go, we do have a double-digit increase in brand-building coming on crackers, wholesome snacks and Pringles. We have renovation of the core Nutri-Grain business and brand. We have a big range of seasonal innovations across cookies and wholesome that will drive fun and excitement and display in store. We have Cheez-It innovation coming in the back half. And we have lots of new pack formats across crackers, cookies, and wholesome snacks to drive incremental consumption in new occasions. And a lot of those packs will exist in the mainstream retail environment as well. So we have a pretty packed program of things to come that will drive excitement in the category and we'll benefit from the brand-building as we put it in in the back half of the year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just one quick follow-up \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Just add one more comment to that. I think Paul made the point that while we're coming out of DSD and going into a warehouse system, we're not just going to any warehouse system. We're going into the Kellogg warehouse system, which is designed to help support large heavily-merchandised categories like cereal. So even when we come into this warehouse system, we'll continue to have feet on the street. We'll continue to drive merchandising with our customers. And as we do this, obviously, we're improving our customer margins on these products and it makes it even more profitable for the margins to support our business.","So we feel that we have some advantages in our warehouse system, given how it's set up, given our experience with cereal and our continued presence in store with feet on the street.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just one follow-up, when you guys use the phrase optimize the portfolio, I generally think that means there's some SKU elimination and you can quantify a sales drag. But I'm also hearing that you're trying to restage the shelf to put your biggest brands on. So I'm a little confused. Is there a quantification of SKU elimination and you could say, okay, it's like a two-point drag against the Snack business?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","I can't give you a quantification today, David. But what you're saying is what we're doing. We are eliminating tail where it doesn't make sense. And we're looking to prioritize and maximize assortment against the biggest things we have. And so when I talk about putting more brand-building in behind brands like Cheez-Its and Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera, we are making sure that we have the most efficient and effective assortment to drive our business harder going forward. But there is a degree of SKU rationalization, and we've leant in proactively on that.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. It's actually Josh on for Ken. On DSD, I guess sticking with this. I know you've talked about in the past, about the plan generally \u2013 or you talked earlier about it being on track. But you've also talked in the past about having to give back on certain terms like on price to customers in Keebler. I know it's early, and the customer's obviously only started the transition with, but trying to get a sense of the level of these give-backs, whether, again, it's pricing or other forms and just being sure that this is more or less where you expect it.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Hey, Josh, I can't go into detail on price or anything that you call the give-backs. But I can tell you that the discussions with retailers have gone well. And within the context of the plans we put together going in, so far so good.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just a larger question on the retail environment, I guess you didn't really emphasize that part as much, right. Obviously, there's some inventory changes that acted as a drag in certain places. But Kraft Heinz last night said that the competitive environment and the pressures they were getting from customers really weren't different from what they usually are, I guess. Would you agree with that assessment? Because, obviously, there have been, obviously a lot of articles lately about big grocers trying to extract something extra from their vendors. We're trying to figure out how this is actually playing out in reality. Thanks.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Yes, Josh, I think it would be fair to say there is always pressure from our retail partners to keep prices low. If you look at the data we see, you see there's not a lot of massive deflation going on in our categories right now. We have seen a little bit of push from private labels in selected categories. Frozen would be one. We've see private label items come up, and we've also seen our Eggo items come up, which suggests that there are factors going on there. And the retail environment is changing to adapt to consumer needs, quite frankly. And so we're seeing growth on the fringes of retail in all kinds of places, just incumbent on us to be more agile with the right food in the right format at the right price, depending on those retail environments. But the pressure is the same as it's always been.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I just had a question on the margin here. It seems like if your top-line guidance is sales decline about 5% and operating profit growth would be up, let's call it, about 5% or so, that implied operating profit margin is, I don't know, up 150, 200 basis points? But what it seems like is that increase in that operating profit for the year that's expected, that obviously doesn't include the full upside on the operating profit margin coming from snacks. So I guess we think about 2018, it would seem like there should be a sizable step up in 2018 that we're not going to see in 2017, even though 2017 is stepping up. Am I thinking about that the right way?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Rob. It's Fareed. A couple of points; first of all, we are on track for the 350 basis point operating profit growth that we've outlined a few years ago and you see that lift in the quarter and you will see that lift in the full year. There is a number of moving parts, and you touched on several of them, so it might be worth just kind of revisiting the phasing a little bit.","First of all, on the top-line, as John mentioned, about half, or 200 basis points, of our top-line decline in Q1 was really quarter-specific factors between the trade inventory and some of the customer discussions. Through Q2, we expect that to moderate and we'll be back to more of a normalized run rate, still negative, for the year. And we guided to down 3%, so that implies still a soft back half, but more normalized.","We had price\/mix favorability in the quarter and we expect that to continue. That's through initiatives as well as regions. On cost of goods, we have seen some favorability in raw materials. We have Project K and ZBB initiatives that are already in flight. And those are going to deliver the objectives that we have set out. And so those are pretty large numbers for the year, and they will basically deliver pretty consistently throughout the four quarters.","And then we get to the DSD, which is really the primary driver of some of the phasing differences. And, as Paul mentioned, we've got brand building investments. We've got investments in the network, in inventory and getting ready for the transition to make sure that that's successful. And then, we have price changes with customers. And then, we operate the DSD network and the warehouse network somewhat in parallel until we get a critical cut mass of customers on the warehouse model and then we can start taking down and capturing the cost benefits.","And so that actually drives the most significant kind of first half, second half phasing. And obviously, with the size of the network and some of the more front-loaded investments, those are big swings. So we do see operating margin up 100 basis points and definitely on track for the 350.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on U.S. Snacks, the organic sales were down 6% in the North America sub-segment and I realize there are some kind of one-off variables driving that performance, but as think about as we go through the rest of the year, it does sound like as you transition into more retailers, there's maybe a bit more incremental pricing pressure, maybe even a bit more incremental volume pressure. So is the thought that the overall North America performance should still improve as we go through the year, despite potential worsening in U.S. Snacks?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Yes, we see the improvement coming sequentially across the year. A far as the Snacks business is concerned, obviously, I'm not sure we'll see incremental volume or price pressure, as John alluded to. As part of the transition, our retailers will actually get more margin here. And we have great plans to pull coming through in brand-building. So we will see some deflation of pricing because of the net sales impact, but overall underlying velocities, there's going to be a lot of volatility. But we're still going to execute our plan.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. These go ahead.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Morning. Thank you.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Good morning.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Just wanted to touch on snacks. First of all, make sure I heard you right, that about half the decline there was just consumption-driven. Snacks, obviously, recently has been one of the few bright spots in packaged food for top-line momentum. Are you seeing that turn? And what's changed there that you would point to the consumption decline?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","I think some of that 50% or so, half of it being consumption decline, was related to the January, February impacts that I think the entire industry felt. We're not anticipating those declines to become the norm. I think they were transitory in nature. And so we feel very confident that snacking categories are ripe for growth going forward.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","And can you touch on the Kashi Snacks launch? You had some of those new items early in the year. And maybe then you were poorly timed if the whole sort of industry impacted with it were out of favor, but how is that running against your expectations both in terms of distribution and the velocities?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Specifically to Kashi Snacks, we launched two Nut Butter Bars at the beginning of the year here, and so far so good. The pickup has been better than we expected. We have more listings to come in the back half around nut butters. We're also fully renovating our chewy bars here at the end of the second quarter, moving into the third quarter, and the food is significantly preferred, so we have a real upgrade coming on our chewy bars. So that's the innovation and renovation. We've just gone back on air with new advertising which features the bars here in March, April, so. And that will continue through Q2 and Q3. So we are on track to deliver what we expected this year.","Now as we've said, on Kashi bars in particular, we expected growth on cereal this year from a consumption point of view. That is our outlook. On bars, we expected to dramatically decline the rate of decline, if you like. So we're not expecting growth, but we are expecting a much lower rate of decline, in the single digits. And so far, we're on track and we feel good with the uptake of these new bars.","In terms of points of distribution on bars, we are seeing going into the second half of the year, a stabilization as it pertains to points of distribution, which is positive because we hadn't seen that over the past couple of years. So with a bit of luck and a bit of hope and a bit of good execution, we're bottoming out here and we can start to look forward on snacks.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","No, that's helpful. And just a last follow-up, on the acceleration broadly that you expect across the portfolio, where do you see the biggest opportunities for that? And what should we be watching for when to see that come through?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Specifically to Kashi, Michael, or to the...","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","No, no. For your whole portfolio, when you talk about you expect the accelerating top-line over the course of the year, what would be the biggest drivers of that?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Granted, we expect it to come across all of our businesses, as I mentioned, that we see consumption disconnected from shipments in just about every category. So we expect improving consumption on cereal through the back half of the year. We expect it on cookies and crackers from a velocity point of view, Pop-Tarts. Frozen, we're anticipating getting back into growth. Kashi Cereal, we're looking to see that consumption growth come through in our business. Specialty, we expect to maintain the momentum we've developed. And in our Canadian business, we're going to lap, as I said, the pricing interventions from a year ago soon, and we expect an improving performance there as well. So it really is broad-based.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. John, in terms of the E.U. softness around the customer negotiations, and I guess specifically the weakness in the UK, my understanding was that the net revenue management was going to be an increasing component for the business as the year rolled on into 2018. But, I guess given the consumer weakness you're seeing, maybe some of the UK inflation building from Brexit, how are you thinking about the risks to the net revenue management approach at this point?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","John, I'd say that the revenue growth management work is even more important in a difficult environment like we have in Europe. So if you look at what happened in Europe in the first quarter, Cereal actually was broadly in line with what our expectation was. Pringles was the big deviation from what we both expected and the historical run rate. And what happened there is we had to take some pack-price architecture moves to offset both some cost inflation, but also big transactional foreign exchange issues that that business has, given how some of the cross rates have moved within Europe.","Unfortunately, that did result in some customer disruption, some customer disputes. We are happy to say they are behind us, and we've come to common ground with our retail partners. And now here in Q2, there'll be some lingering impact of that, but that will be behind us, so we'll be able to move forward, getting that business back into good growth in the back half of the year, as we've seen over the last four or five years.","The Pringles business actually has a pattern of every about five years doing a food improvement, changing pack-price and improving price realization. We were due for that this year on Pringles, both in Europe and the U.S. This is the first time we've done it under Kellogg ownership. Quite frankly, the disruption was a bit more than what we anticipated, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. I'm happy to say it's behind us and we are moving back on track with where we need to be on that business as we go forward.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up, in terms of the ingredients renovations and reformulations, is there a way to frame where you are in terms of that program? Are you halfway through, 25% through? Can you just quantify, maybe, how much work still remains?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","It's an ongoing process because the definitions of health and wellness and what consumers are looking for continues to change and evolve. So if you look at what we're doing to drive top-line growth, a big part of it is ensuring we have on-trend food and packaging. So this year, we have about a 50 basis point headwind on cost of goods as we make decisions to reinvest back in our food, whether that be elimination of artificials on waffles, which is doing very well here in the first quarter, or improving the performance of the food profile of Pringles, or investing back into our core cereal business. So these are changes that we'll keep doing. It won't be a case of getting it behind us. It's an ever, ongoing, evergreen evolutionary part of our business.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, John.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just had one question, John, and it's a follow-up to the answer you gave to an earlier question about \u2013 you made a reference to the strength of your warehouse system and how that's, sort of, a good fit for the biscuit business. One of the things that has always, sort of, justified DSD is just turns, how much, how fast or how often a category turns and like soft drinks are an extreme. It turns like 80 times a year. Can you just give us a sense, in terms of the biscuit business, what the turns are or, more importantly, what they are relative to some of the big products in your warehouse brands now? Are they turned roughly the same amount and that's what gives you confidence that you can service it just as well?","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Absolutely. So take cereal, for example. The velocity on items like cereal and Pop-Tarts are similar to or better than the turns on cookies and crackers. So we are used to distributing a high velocity, high merchandising set of categories through this warehouse system. The feature and display is also very strong on cereal and Pop-Tarts, as it is on cookies and crackers. Remember that 40% of our Snacks business today goes through the warehouse system. And where we go through that warehouse system, we have better delivery performance, we have better share performance and we have a better growth profile.","So we have already proven that these products can go through a warehouse system and, quite frankly, a warehouse system largely delivers cookies and crackers in major markets around the world. So what we're doing here in the U.S. is not new to the world. This is how these products go to market in markets like the UK, et cetera. So we are very confident in our ability to enable this and have it work. We do recognize that in the transition, there can be some disruption. This is a complicated thing that we're doing here. We have great plans around it. We believe we're well-positioned to execute it, but the destination is absolutely the right place. The path to get there is where we have to stay very focused and execute with excellence.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. My question is for Fareed. By the way, welcome to the company. Cash flow, you've got a bunch of tailwinds with free cash. I know that you maintained your guidance for the year, but you've got some really meaningful working capital benefits that you're improving on. You've got your operating profit margins improving. Your CapEx for Project K should be coming down. Is some of that being offset? Well, obviously, some of it is being offset by lower revenue, but do you have other, maybe one-time cash uses right now for like the DSD conversion, or can you give us a little bit of feel for why we're not actually trickling up a little bit on free cash?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Sure, Eric, and hello and thanks for the welcome. So we still have cash costs with some of the restructurings that we have in place through the various initiatives. And when we first launched them, we talked about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And we're about $1.3 billion through those upfront costs. So there's still some left. The primary driver, as you noted, is going to be associated with the DSD conversion. We're still focused on working capital. We're still focused on a lot of the other initiatives. And so it's really \u2013 there's some upfront cost investment. As you noted, we increased the dividend and will have board authorization for share buybacks as well. And that $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion cash flow target for the year still feels right.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First a question on the DSD-supported businesses, how are you thinking about your year-over-year shipment performance as you go through the rest of the year and what's baked into your guidance?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","We don't give quarterly indications, but we have factored in, obviously, a degree of an inventory build and a transfer here through the second and third quarter, which will be offset by some other factors as the year goes on. So as John, I think, might pick it up, we'd originally factored in the impact to the company in the year from this. And there's no change to that.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Yes, so I think as we said before, we'll see a little bit of an inventory build probably Q2 and into Q3. So Q2 might be a little bit better than in Q3. And Q4, you'll see the price adjustments which will bring down our net sales. But, obviously, that will be with us as we go into 2018 as well. So that gives you a sense of a bit of the phasing as we go through the year.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful, thank you. And then also, just looking at some of the scanner data for the first quarter, it looks similar to some of the past quarters, where Special K has been relatively weak and snack bars relatively weak, but it sounds like those are some areas; I don't know if it's Special K specifically, but your claim that you're going to get back to growth in Cereal is certainly speaking to improvement somewhere. And I guess you mentioned the new chewy bars that you're going to be launching. But any detail about how you're going to be improving those businesses would be helpful. Thanks.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Company","Yes. It's Paul, David. The Special K Cereal business has actually flattened out pretty much and held or grown share in the last two years. The impact in Q1 was really down to a timing of innovation activity, and we have all of that lined up to start and it's starting here in May, as we speak. So the Cereal business, you picked it up. If we're going to win and drive this category forward, our Core 6 needs to fire on all cylinders. And K needs to do better in the back half. We think we have the plans to do that. Our kid brands momentum will continue, specifically with wholesome snacks. There's more than Special K to wholesome snacks.","Rice Krispies Treats continues to grow, and we look to accelerate that. Nutri-Grain has significant renovation coming as well. And then the Special K transition is underway, with better food and we'll benefit from the new campaign across the entire brand. So we expect an improving trend in Special K bars as part of our wholesome snack business year to go.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","John P.

Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are pleased that the momentum we've seen so far this year has continued to build through the third quarter. Total currency-neutral comparable revenue growth of 1% was above our top-line guidance for the full year and it builds on the flat growth we posted in the first half of the year. We saw sales respond to the investment we've made, continued stabilization in many of our businesses in the quarter and growth in the U.S. Specialty channels, Canadian, Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses. In addition, we continue to make great progress with our productivity initiatives.","Overall currency-neutral comparable operating profit was in line with our expectations and included a significant impact from this year's rebasing of incentive compensation. Ron will discuss this in more detail, but, excluding this impact, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth would've been approximately 6% in the quarter.","We are raising our guidance for cash flow to $1.1 billion in 2015. We're on track to meet our guidance for currency-neutral comparable sales, operating profit and earnings per share in 2015. And we will achieve these results while setting up an even better year in 2016.","The momentum we're building and our aggressive productivity programs give us confidence that we will meet our long-term targets for currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth in 2016 and beyond. We'll give you more color regarding our overall business at our Investor Day in a few weeks, but we are excited about the plans we have for each of our businesses and the performance we expect as a result.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for discussion of our financial results","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 4 shows the financial results for the third quarter. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%, greater than our full-year guidance for growth. We saw strong growth across many of our emerging and developing markets in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. We are pleased with the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. U.S. Snacks improved sequentially. And we grew in the U.S. Specialty channel and Canadian businesses. And Pringles posted increased sales growth in each of our regions. Reported net sales declined by 8.5% due to foreign currency translation.","Comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%; however, as John mentioned, that decline includes a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation this year. Without this impact, comparable operating profit would've been eight points higher and would have shown growth of approximately 6%. This reinforces our previous comments on the operating leverage in our business. Reported operating profit was $334 million in the third quarter, including items affecting comparability, as detailed in the appendices to our presentation.","Comparable earnings per share were $0.85 in the quarter. And these results include $0.11 of currency headwind. So currency-neutral comparable earnings per share were $0.96, an increase of 2.1% from the third quarter of last year.","Slide 5 shows the components of the quarter's sales growth. We had good price\/mix realization despite some adverse country mix in Europe and Asia Pacific. Overall, volume declined by 1.6%. And while volume declined in our U.S. Cereal and Snacks businesses, we continue to see signs of stabilization. The Asia Pacific region posted good volume growth, as did Mexico, the Mediterranean and Middle East regions and Specialty channels in the U.S. And we continue to see strong volume performance from Pringles across the globe.","The impact of foreign exchange lowered reported net sales by almost 10%, driven by a wide basket of currencies. And note that our devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at mid-year represents almost half of the 10 point impact to sales.","Slide 6 shows details regarding our third quarter currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved by 20 basis points. Year-to-date gross margin remained unchanged from last year. Overall, commodity and packaging costs are deflationary and our strong productivity initiatives, combined with Project K savings, are benefiting our supply chain costs. However, we are seeing continued higher transportation costs. In addition, we are investing more money in our foods. Examples include our launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and renovation of existing foods, such as Special K. The combination of these factors has resulted in relatively flat gross margins year-to-date.","Slide 7 shows the third quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 3%. This was due to the slight decline in sales and a significant impact of rebasing incentive compensation. The rebasing reduced operating profit by eight points in the quarter. We expect further improvement in North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.","Europe's operating profit increased by 3% in the third quarter. This growth was a result of deflation in commodities and strong productivity in cost of goods sold. And it also included an increase in brand building in the quarter.","Operating profit in Latin America increased by 15%, as a result of strong sales growth in the region, including the impact from Venezuela. While we did see some adverse shift in the timing of sales in certain part of the region impacting our third quarter, we are growing volume and sales year-to-date.","Operating profit decreased by 20% in the Asia Pacific region. We are investing some Project K savings in this region to drive growth, so the result includes investment in our brands and capabilities.","Slide 8 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $580 million. This result includes year-to-date investment in Project K of approximately $260 million. And, as I mentioned last quarter, cash costs for Project K in 2015 will be approximately $350 million, the most in any year of the project.","As you can see on the chart, we now expect full-year cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of $100 million from our original estimate. This increase is due to accelerated performance of our supplier-financing initiative in the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect that this initiative will offset the approximately $350 million in full-year cash costs for Project K.","Slide 9 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. In the past, we have discussed our focus on working capital improvements and our supplier-financing initiative, in particular. Over the first nine months of this year, we have reduced our core working capital as a percentage of sales by more than one point. And, as I said, we expect accelerated progress on supplier-financing in the fourth quarter, and we are also evaluating new initiatives to unlock even more cash from our working capital.","Slide 10 shows our guidance for 2015. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect gross margin for the year to be relatively flat also.","We continue to expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%, and we also still expect that currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will be in a range between flat and down 2%. And results for both currency-neutral comparable operating profit and earnings per share still include a negative impact of three points to four points from the resetting of incentive compensation.","The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share do exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. Our expectation for the impact of foreign exchange translation is now approximately $0.31 a share, an increase from the $0.29 per share we expected last quarter. This change is due to the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling and the Australian dollar.","Our expectations for net interest expense have increased to between $225 million and $230 million, driven by slightly higher levels of debt associated with our acquisitions in Nigeria and Egypt. We now expect that the full-year tax rate will be between 26% and 27%, which will cover the impact of higher interest cost and other below-the-line items.","Guidance for total capital spending remains in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately one point of sales for incremental capital to execute Project K, and we still expect share repurchases of approximately $700 million to $750 million for this year.","Slide 11 shows our full-year earnings per share walk. Costs for the integration of acquisitions are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share, although they could be to the high end of that range, given the recent acquisitions in Egypt and Nigeria. And we now anticipate that Project K's pre-tax profit and loss statement costs will be between $350 million and $400 million, or approximately $0.70 to $0.80 per share for the year. We expect that two-thirds of these costs will be in cost of goods sold. The change in the expected cost is simply due to the timing of projects between years. Project K remains on track. And our estimate for savings in 2015 and 2016 has not changed.","Slide 12 shows our guidance for 2016. As we communicated on our Q2 call, we expect our currency-neutral comparable sales to be in our long-term guidance range for low single-digit growth. We also expect 4% to 6% growth in currency-neutral comparable operating profit. As we mentioned last quarter, if current sales growth trends continue, it could put us at the lower end of our long-term sales targets, but even if this happens, we will still meet our goals for operating profit growth due to the significant productivity programs we have underway.","We expect currency-neutral comparable earnings per share growth of between 6% and 8%. And our outlook assumes a similar amount of share repurchases to the $700 million to $750 million we expect in 2015.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for a discussion of operating performance by segment.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ron. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. Results for the third quarter came in as we expected. The Kellogg brand gained share in the quarter and saw continued sequential improvement in consumption. In fact, our total consumption was essentially flat and we gained share. Importantly, category base sales were up in the quarter and we outpaced the category.","Our six core cereals grew in combination and gained share. Raisin Bran posted double-digit growth, due to great advertising and the popular cranberry innovation. Overall, Mini-Wheats did well, as core Bite Size posted growth in both base and incremental sales and our second-half innovation did well, including Pumpkin Spice Mini-Wheats, which were a big hit.","As you can see on the chart, Special K continued to benefit from activity that began in the second quarter. The brand posted increased sales and share gains again, just as it did last quarter. And our adult cereals in total, which have been an area of softness, returned to growth.","And finally for Morning Foods, we've had a great reception for the innovation we have planned for the first quarter. For example, we're launching Special K Nourish, which is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see in the food. There are two SKUs in the U.S., Cranberry Coconut Almond and Apple Raspberry Almond. And both are made with a multi-grain quinoa flake. So the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trends grains like quinoa.","You'll remember that this ready-to-eat cereal has been very popular in other parts of the world, and retail acceptance in the U.S. has been encouraging. We've got a lot of activity planned for the launch, and we're excited about the potential.","Let's turn to Slide 14 and our U.S. Snacks business. Overall, we saw sequential improvement in the Cracker, Cookie, Wholesome Snack, and Pringles businesses in the third quarter. In all channels, overall consumption of our crackers was essentially flat in the quarter, and our big three brands posted low single-digit consumption growth in measured channels.","The Cheez-It brand posted consumption growth of 3%, driven by increased display and the success of two new products, Cheez-It Grooves and Extra Toasty. In addition, Cheez-It also grew base sales at a mid-single digit rate, much faster than the category average.","The Club brand also posted increased consumption and share gains as the core business performed well, and the new Town House and Kashi also gained share and now holds 0.6% share of the overall category.","Our Special K Cracker and Popcorn Chips, which have been an adverse headwind, continue to impact results. And while we're continuing to be impacted by past losses in distribution, the products we restaged earlier this year posted slight consumption growth in the quarter.","In the Cookie category, the Fudge Shoppe, Chips Deluxe, Famous Amos, Fudge Stripes and Mother's brands all posted consumption growth in the quarter. We have some strong brands which respond well to activity, and we're encouraged by recent performance. We're pleased that we're seeing sequential improvement in the business, although we have been impacted by a decline in 100 calorie packs this year, as we've discussed before.","The Wholesome Snack business posted a low single digit decline in consumption in measured channels, plus the Club channel. And the Special K brand posted an increase in consumption of almost 3% across the same channels, driven by new Special K Chewy Nut Bars.","The Pringles business posted low single digit sales growth, building on high single digit growth last year. Across all channels, including Club and Convenience combined, Pringles posted mid-single digit growth in the quarter.","So the team has been doing a lot of work in each of the categories, and we're seeing sequential improvement as a result. There's a lot more to come as well. And we'll hear more about some of those plans at the Investor Day scheduled for later in the month.","Slide 15 shows highlights regarding the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty channels increased by 6% in the quarter, with Foodservice, Convenience, and Vending channels all posted growth. The Foodservice performance was driven by the growth of whole grain offerings in the K through 12 school business.","The Convenience business had an easier comp last year, due to a customer lowering their inventory. In addition, we also saw excellent broad-based growth across the categories in the Convenience channel. And year-to-date, we've grown share in the Cereal, Cracker, Wholesome Snack and Cookie categories.","Finally for Specialty, the Pringles business also continues to do well. As you can see on the slide, our new Zip Dip product, Pringles and dip together, won the Retailer Choice Award for best new product in the Convenience channel and helped the overall Pringles business post double digit growth and gain share in Q3. The team continues to expect a strong fourth quarter for both sales and operating profit and are excited about our prospects for 2016.","Slide 16 highlights performance of the North America Other segment, including the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. In the Frozen Foods business, our Eggo hand-held sandwiches continued to perform well in the quarter. As you've seen in public data, consumption increased at a strong double digit rate, and we gained share. Elsewhere in the business, a number of items affected performance, including egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity, and the drawing-down of inventories in anticipation of an exciting change to packaging. We ended the third quarter with low levels of retail inventory. And we expect a continued impact in the fourth quarter, with improvement in 2016.","The Kashi business is seeing stabilized distribution and sequential improvement in cereal consumption and share performance, although sales still declined. In Cereal, our Sweet Potato Sunshine and sprouted grain cereals are doing well. In fact, overall consumption trends improved significantly as the year has progressed. In the latest data, year-to-date cereal consumption was down 13%, 12 week consumption was down 7% and four week consumption was down only 3%. So the team has done a great job and we're on track to return the business to growth in 2016. And we're increasingly confident about next year. We're focused on progressive nutrition and have some great introductions planned. In fact, our total weight of innovation in 2016 is twice what it has been in 2015.","And finally, net sales for the Canadian business increased in the quarter, due to growth in Wholesome Snacks, Pringles and Frozen Foods and we grew share in the Cereal category. Unfortunately, the combination of the performance of the Frozen Food and Kashi businesses led to a quarterly sales decline in the segment.","Let's turn to Slide 17 and our European business. The Pringles business in Europe posted strong double digit net sales growth in the quarter. The base business posted growth in the launch of Pringles Tortilla (sic) [Tortillas] in the UK and Germany also contributed to the overall performance. In addition, we had strong commercial initiatives across the region. And we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter, traditionally the quarter of the year with the highest level of sales.","We have exciting plans for the region's Wholesome Snack business in the fourth quarter and into 2016. As in many parts of the world, we are making significant investment in our food in Europe. This includes the relaunch of Special K Bars, an extensive innovation that will include completely new foods with fruits, nuts and seeds.","The Cereal business declined in the quarter, as a result of continued difficult environment in the UK and parts of the continent. The focus for the team is to strengthen the overall plan and improve performance. With this in mind, we have included additional activity in the UK focused on Crunchy Nut, Krave, our porridge products, a tie-in with of Star Wars and increased levels of holiday promotions.","In addition, there's exciting activity coming in the first quarter. We're taking lessons learned from the U.S. and applying them in the region. We're adding more red berries to Special K. And we're launching new products including cereals, mueslis and granolas and also launching Special K Nourish cereal.","Slide 18 shows highlights for our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales increased at a double digit rate. Cereal sales in the region increased significantly. And we've seen good volume growth and have held or increased year-to-date share in strategic businesses like Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of Kellogg's branded granolas and mueslis.","Sales in the Snack business also increased in the quarter, driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. And we've gained year-to-date share in the Wholesome Snack businesses in Brazil and Colombia.","The Pringles business continued to perform well and we've launched Pringles Tortilla (sic) [Tortillas] in the region. And our initiative to drive sales in high-frequency stores continues to go well. We've gained year-to-date share in this channel in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil and have increased the number of stores we're reaching at a double digit rate. There's a lot of opportunity in these channels in both the Latin American and Asian regions and that will continue to be a focus for us next year.","The team in Latin America is expecting strong fourth quarter results, due to the high-frequency store program, the continued impact of granolas and mueslis, new bars launching in Brazil, new Special K Protein in Mexico and some significant brand-building events across the region. Plans for 2016 include more great innovation and brand-building events. However, as you know, a number of countries are facing a slowdown in their economies. And while we have plans to deal with this and the impact of transactional foreign exchange, it will remain a headwind in 2016.","Let's turn to Slide 19 and our Asia Pacific business. We saw strong double digit growth in the Asian business in the third quarter. The Indian business posted double digit growth, driven by single-serve packs and strong results from the core brands. The Japanese business grew at a double digit rate, as the result of continued popularity of granola and packaging innovation. And the Korean business also grew at a double digit rate.","The business in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Pringles business both posted high single digit sales growth. On Pringles specifically, we continued to see great results in the region and our activity and investment have gained traction. In addition, our new Pringles plant in Malaysia is performing well.","The overall Asia Pacific segment posted currency-neutral comparable sales growth of 2% in the quarter. The Australian business continues to be difficult. And we also faced the impact of differences in the year-on-year timing of promotions in the quarter. We expect declines in Australia to moderate in the fourth quarter. And we have plans for further improvement in 2016.","Let's turn to Slide 20 and comments on our JV's in Asia. Although they're not reported in Asia Pacific's results, both the Chinese and Nigerian businesses posted very strong growth in the quarter. In China, both Cereal and Snacks grew at a double digit rate and we gained share in the Cereal category.","As you know, we announced in September our investment in West Africa. Specifically, we announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in Multipro, a premier sales and distribution company in Nigeria and Ghana. And we announced the creation of a snacks and breakfast joint venture across West Africa with Tolaram Africa, one of the largest food companies in the region. We are very excited about the investment that this region is experiencing explosive growth with a growing middle class.","Nigeria alone has the largest population and economy in all of Africa. At the time of the transaction, we announced that the total company sales from Multipro were expected to be approximately $750 million in 2015. Just to put that into perspective, our Asia Pacific business posted total sales of slightly less than $1 billion last year, so you can see the transformational impact this acquisition has on the region and why we're so excited about the potential.","Amit Banati, our head of Asia Pacific, will discuss both partnerships in more detail at the Investor Day, but I will say that we're very pleased to have these great relationships in place. And we're confident that they will be significant contributors to total corporate results in the years to come.","Let's turn to the summary on page 21. Results for net sales growth and operating profit were in line with our expectations and we continue to build momentum. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%. And currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of resetting incentive compensation, increased by approximately 6% and we also increased guidance for full-year cash flow.","In the quarter, we saw improving trends in our U.S. Cereal business. We saw sequential improvement in our U.S. Snacks business. The Kashi brand continued to improve as we expected. Our International business continued to perform well. And importantly, our productivity programs continue to generate significant savings. And we're on track with both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiatives. These two cost savings programs, in conjunction with our underlying productivity programs, give us a significant amount of visibility into future results.","So, as I said, we are building momentum. With good performance in the third quarter and our visibility into increased efficiency, give us confidence that we'll meet our targets for 2015, 2016 and beyond. We recognize that we have a lot to do, but we have a plan. We know we can achieve our targets. Our employees around the world are doing great work. And, as always, I'd like to end by thanking them all.","And now, I'll open up it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. A question about the promotional activity; it seems that, as measured by Nielsen, the in-store promotional activity has been declining in Cereal, as it has been for many categories. Why do you think that is? And do you see promotion spending continuing to come out of the category? And is there perhaps a shift away from traditional in-store promotions towards other stuff, like consumer marketing and digital? Thanks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We continue to see good merchandising performance behind our categories in-store. We have categories that do respond to that sort of merchandising activity. I think you have seen on an aggregate basis, some merchandising reduction. That actually is more tailored to what a small number of customers are doing in the area of specific clean store policies. In fact, we're lapping one of those larger customers, lapping that initiative sort of the middle of this year. So that should have less of an impact as we go forward. We are ultimately, though, focused on winning with the consumer through brand-building, through innovation, through engaging the consumer directly, but we feel good about our in-store merchandising performance.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just a follow-up on your innovation comments, you said that you'll have double the innovation or have double the innovation activity heading into 2016 than you had in 2015. In food, we're never really sure if more means better when it comes to innovation. Are there reasons why you feel like your innovation will be more incremental or are there ways that you're changing your innovation process to make it more incremental? Thanks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great question, David. Let me just clarify that double the weight of innovation is actually a comment only for Kashi in 2016 here in the U.S. And we're doing a lot to invest back into our innovation process as a company to improve the performance of our innovation. We established our global category teams so we'd have a longer-term innovation platform coming out of those global category teams.","In the case of Kashi specifically, pulling the team back in La Jolla, back in California, and allowing them to focus on the longer-term innovation to move at a faster pace, as is required in that particular segment of the market, is showing dividends. I think you've seen that in the Kashi business performance improving and also in that greater innovation coming through next year.","And also, as you think about innovation, I think you can see more from us in the area of packaging as we try to hit the right package-price-product offering by channel, by market. So I think as you look at our innovation pipeline going forward, it's both a stronger pipeline in terms of we have a longer-term pipeline with our global category teams and it's a more diverse pipeline in that it's not just more food. It's food. It's packaging. It's in the core parts of the business as well as in the leading segments of the business as well.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I guess my question is if maybe can give us a little more color on how you're progressing on zero-based budgeting, you mentioned that you have better visibility into next year. And I would imagine that the ZBB efforts are starting to gain some momentum. Can you give us some updates on what areas of your cost structure you're focusing it on and where you expect to see the biggest benefits?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Rob. So our initiative is progressing well in North America. And, as we said earlier, we would be rolling that out across the globe as well. We have not started that work yet, but that should be beginning in 2016. We continue to have very good visibility to the $100 million of savings that we've communicated on zero-based budgeting, and that's specifically in North America.","And you may recall, we said we're interrogating around $2 billion worth of discretionary spend. Now, that is just $2 billion within North America. So far, we've identified a number of things. We're looking across supply chain costs, supply chain overhead, distribution costs, and SG&A as well. We've noted a number of areas around our policies and practices, based on benchmarks that we have from this process. An example is travel and people-related costs. We found that we're investing or spending more money in some of those areas and there's a great opportunity to pull back. We've interrogated professional services as well. And we're looking into brand-building as well and dissecting our brand-building investment, both from a working perspective and a non-working perspective.","One other thing that I do want to point out as well, as we get into 2016 and we provide more information on our guidance, we are unlikely to provide guidance around our gross margin percent and our brand-building percent to sales as well. Now, let me assure you, both of these are absolutely critical to our business. And we remain focused on investing behind our brands and building our brands and maintaining a strong gross margin. But the advent of zero-based budgeting and how that may change the complexion of our profit and loss statement as well as the changing landscape, how you build brands, the shift of TV media to digital media as well and the investments we're putting back in our food, make it difficult for us to provide specifics on those items.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm sorry, Ron. You said that it's going to be more difficult to provide gross margin guidance going forward?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","What I'm saying is we won't be providing those details going forward. Obviously, we have a plan and understand where our gross margin and our brand-building are going, but we won't be providing those details because of the shifting landscape as a result of our zero-based budgeting initiative.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess a couple of questions, with the understanding you're going to have the Analyst Day shortly. I guess first, I guess this is kind of after the quarter closed, but one of your competitors had a pretty big recall with their biggest brand. And I'm wondering if you're seeing a benefit to that or has the category overall been hurt by that? Maybe you could just go a little bit into that. And I have some follow-ups.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Eric, I think we're seeing a very strong performance from the U.S. Cereal category. It's improved significantly over the last couple of years. Total consumption is relatively flat. And within our business, we're seeing a significant improvement within our core brands, also in the two brands that we've struggled with over the last few years, Special K and Kashi. You're seeing significantly better performance from those brands as we go forward.","So I don't think that particular event that you're pointing to has had a meaningful impact on the category or our business. I think it's good for us all to get past those sorts of events. And I think you're seeing a better longer-term build in the performance of the category over time.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess, Ron, in answer to Rob's question, maybe can you quantify, at least this year, how much more you're spending in terms of the quality food initiative, like the higher-cost ingredients? Like how much is that, let's say, limiting your gross margins?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So we haven't quantified that specifically, Eric, but it's probably 20 basis points or 30 basis points of impact that we're seeing within our business, depending upon which quarter you're looking at, based on the roll-out of granolas and mueslis across the globe, the renovation we're doing around Special K and some of our other foods as well.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then last thing, I know this is small, but I noticed in the release that you restated $3 million of sales due to restructuring and other items. Why would sales be restated as a function of a restructuring?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","In some cases, Eric, we are having to change our foods. It's requiring us to pull turn product from shelf and re-slot new product in its place. So these are listing fees, in some cases, associated with them.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you felt that was part of a, like a restructuring?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","It is specifically related to the Project K network initiatives that we're conducting.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right, I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, everybody.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Andrew.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Morning.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I know that you've talked about continuing to expect your sales and EBIT growth in line with your long-term algorithm in 2016. And I guess for the first time, you provided the EPS part of that for next year, which, I guess, at 6% to 8%, is maybe slightly below what the long-term algorithm has been. And maybe it's just splitting hairs and conservatism or just maybe it's a higher tax rate, but trying to get a sense of why you wouldn't be getting maybe the typical below-the-line benefit that you'd expect. And if you can provide some perspective on that, that would be helpful.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely, Andrew. So we do have an expectation for slightly higher interest costs, with the potential for rates moving higher into next year. In addition, we're seeing lower than normal tax rate this year, as a result of tax planning initiatives that we've undertaken. We communicated a 26% to 27% rate for 2015. So we do expect that rate to tick up slightly. And then offsetting that are the normal share repurchases that we'll conduct over the course of the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks for that. And then, yeah, thanks for the clarity on the impact to gross margin of food quality and such. I guess I'm trying to get a sense, and I don't think, I guess, you'll be giving guidance on this per se next year, but I guess directionally from a gross margin standpoint with the favorability around some commodity movements of late, all of the ongoing productivity you have, the Project K, the ZBB impact, which ramps up dramatically next year, shift to digital and such, I guess I'm trying get a sense, I would think gross margin directionally would accelerate quite a bit year-over-year versus the flat result that we're likely to see this year. Is there anything that I'm missing in how I'm thinking about that?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","In terms of our gross margin performance for next year, obviously, we haven't quantified it yet. And you're right. We are seeing some deflation in some of the exchange-traded commodities. Now obviously, that's just the commodity aspect of that item. We are seeing inflation, though, in other commodity elements. For example, fruits, nuts, cocoa, rice are escalating. And we're seeing higher distribution costs and slightly higher factory costs, but we're being able to offset that with our strong productivity initiatives and Project K savings as well. So overall, at this point in time, we're expecting our input costs to be relatively neutral, offset by our productivity.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Cereal category. John, you mentioned, you'd seen some improved trends there. And it's a simple question, but it touches on a lot of things. What's allowing for improved trends in both the category and for yourself? Is it a change in the number of occasions, like you're losing fewer occasions? Or is it a change \u2013 and I'm talking about the category level here \u2013 in share, meaning like are more people eating breakfast or maybe less worse change in fewer people eating breakfast? Or is it that Greek yogurt or other breakfast options kind of or maybe Foodservice kind of reached a high watermark and it's ceasing to eat into Cereal's lordly share advantage in the breakfast occasion? Thanks very much.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jonathan, yeah, we've seen on breakfast, we've actually seen consumption of breakfast at home growing, so it's not the issue around QSRs, et cetera. It's been more how we compete at that breakfast occasion at home.","If you go back to the 2000s, obviously, our business in the category grew quite strongly. And what was growing our business at that time were the adult cereals. If you look at what's happened here more recently, those adult cereals, particularly Special K and Kashi, went quite soft. By the end of the third quarter, we actually saw our adult cereals return back to growth. You're seeing Special K return to growth behind movement and positioning. It got caught in a little bit more of a diet positioning towards a wellness positioning now, with new foods coming out that support that. Kashi, between the team in California ramping up the innovations, staying on trend with foods that are evolving and emerging in the marketplace, and you're seeing how the innovation is starting to drive that business back to a better place.","And then even a business like Raisin Bran, where we have a cranberry innovation, some great advertising that's on-trend and we're seeing double digit growth in that brand. So I think a lot of this has to do with what we are doing to drive our business. And, quite frankly, the category performance is a combination of what manufacturers do, rather than a determinate of how all manufacturers do it, so if all the manufacturers do better, the category does better.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Sure, just a follow up on your answer there, John, you said the adult cereals came back. I don't know how you slice and dice what's an adult cereal for a competitor, but do you get the sense that's true for your competitors as well, that it's that adult segment that's come back or is it just better execution, do you think, at Special K?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess I'm more focused specifically on our business. I'd say our business is doing better and that's what's driving certainly our section of the adult segment. And to your point, it is difficult on some of those brands to define what's an adult brand, what's a kid brand, since roughly half the consumption in the kid brands are actually adult consumption, but when we have adult-targeted brands like this, like Raisin Bran and Special K, we've seen those businesses come back.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Great. Thanks very much","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Alexia","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, a couple of quick questions, U.S. Snacks, we obviously read in the press that you might've been interested in a Snacks acquisition recently. That doesn't seem to be going to you at this point. How are you thinking about maybe building out your U.S. Snacks business to get more out of your DSD system in the U.S.? And then I have a follow-up.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me step back a bit and just provide some thoughts on M&A in general, since you had that entry point into the Snacks question. On M&A, we are obviously looking at a number of opportunities around the world. You've seen the company execute three transactions in just the last several months: two acquisitions in Egypt, the largest cookie, cracker company there and the largest cereal business there; and then our West Africa and Nigeria investment. And all three of those are great investments, combination of Snacks, emerging markets, et cetera, and so as you think about our M&A strategy, obviously, the intersection of Snacks and emerging markets is a very interesting place for us to play.","We also would look at M&A in a market like North America in natural and other areas that would be good bolt-ons to our business. On Snacks itself, we have an outstanding DSD platform. It's a company-owned DSD platform. It's an advantaged platform compared to a lot of other DSD platforms out there. And we believe we have an opportunity to keep driving that platform over time. And we're focused on improving the hit rate of innovation in this business. We're seeing good growth in Crackers behind Cheez-Its. We have opportunities in Cookies. We've got some work to do in Wholesome Snacks. So we had some good progress there on the DSD business.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then as a follow up, can I just calibrate my expectations from what success in U.S. Cereals looks like in 2016? I know you were feeling pressure earlier in the year to really get the U.S. Cereal business back on track by the end of the year. It seems as though you're talking in a very positive way about it. You've got a lot of innovation coming down the pipe, but the U.S. Morning Foods organic sales are still down 2.6%. So is it enough just to be gaining share in a category that's down or what's the color? What's the description of what good looks like for next year?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say, Alexia, in a market like the U.S., given the performance of the category in recent years, if we could stabilize the U.S. Cereal business in a stable category, I'd define that as success. So in the context of the Kellogg Company portfolio and hitting our low single digit sales growth target next year, we don't need to see growth from the U.S. Cereal business.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Ken.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Morning.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just two follow ups to questions, one is you did say that the environment is deflationary. How do you think that's going to play out in the promotional environment and which categories are most insulated and which ones are most affected by it? And my next point, I just want to make sure I got it right, is you pointed out that sales may be at the lower end of next year's guidance. Can you talk about why you're already there before the year starts?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ken, great questions. So on the potential deflationary impact on cost of goods and how could that play out in the marketplace, if you look across our categories, our categories are very rational. They compete more on the quality of brands, on the quality of innovation, on ideas, on in-store execution. They are intensely competitive categories, but they're ones that tend to be fairly stable in pricing over time. So I feel good about the dynamic there and don't see that necessarily being disrupted.","On the question of sales guidance, I think there's maybe some confusion there. If you look at the company, we are building momentum. Last year, our internal sales were down around 2%. This year, we're around flat. And next year, we're giving guidance of 1% to 3%. So if you drew a straight line through that trend line, you get down 2%, flat, say, up 2%. The point we tried to make on our guidance for next year is we don't need to deliver 2%, 3% sales growth in order to deliver the 4% to 6% operating profit growth. Our comment there was about the strength and visibility we have into our productivity programs.","And so we believe that if we hit even the low-end of our sales guidance, or even if we were flat on our sales performance next year, we still have the visibility in those productivity programs to hit the 4% to 6% operating profit range. If I add to that, if I'm thinking about our guidance for next year and you asked me the question where is the risk within that guidance, I think the risk is more on the sales guidance than in the operating profit guidance, is another way of getting at what we're trying to say.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate the clarity.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've just two questions; just the first one is on the FX in Latin America. And I guess in this quarter, Venezuela had a pretty meaningful impact. I think it was like a 61% adjustment to sales and 71% adjustment to operating income. Is that like a catch-up one-time thing or will we have a few quarters of like meaningful negative effect from FX?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, good question, Bryan. Thanks for allowing me to clarify. That will impact us as we go through the back half of this year. So this is the translational impact associated with remeasuring Venezuela from the 6.3 bolivar to the U.S. dollar to effectively 200 bolivar to the U.S. dollar. So you'll see an impact for that translational change through the back half of 2015 and into the first half of 2016 as well.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And roughly same order of magnitude; is that right?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Will depend on the size of the business, but, yes, a little bit lower as we move into the front half of next year.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, John, the second question is just around Special K. And I don't know how easy this is to answer, but as the starting point in terms of rebuilding the brand, one of the things was to go after the positioning and kind of positioning away from a weight loss brand to being more of a just more generally healthy brand. How much of the sort of the improvement in Special K has been that that positioning is actually occurring, so consumers are reacting to sort of a different positioning away from weight loss? And if you could also, within that, just talk about how the core Special K business has done, ex the new products?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great question. I think we are seeing the brand make that transition to more of a wellness brand, weight wellness brand then a diet brand. The turnaround in Special K, of course, is not just that positioning in isolation. It's also changing the food, in some cases, to be consistent with that positioning. I think where we've made changes to our food, we've seen even more progress than where we have some legacy foods in place. A lot of food changes, though, are not just new foods in terms of innovation. They're renovating the current foods. And so when you ask the question, well, how much is that new versus the base? Take Special K Red Berries. Adding more red berries to Special K and reinforcing the berries in there really has had a very positive impact on the Special K business in the U.S.","And so it's hard for me to tease apart what is food and what is non-food-related. But the good news is we're definitely seeing people respond to that program, not just here in the U.S. but also in Canada, and we're seeing the brand do better.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you. Look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just two questions, first on brand-building, I know you called out Europe specifically as seeing increased spending during the quarter, but can you just update us for Q3 and maybe year-to-date how brand-building overall is trending, constant currency or as a percent of sales, and how you see this sort of trending into 2016 as Project K savings build, how dependent that may be on how sequential sales trends evolve from here?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question. It's probably worth spending a little bit of time talking about brand-building. Obviously, brand-building is critical to the long-term performance of the Kellogg Company. And the strength of our brands is something that we're absolutely focused on. And you can see that in that we have industry-leading levels of brand-building and we're committed to those brands. At the same time, we are seeing a transformational change in how you build brands. Think about the transformational changes we've seen in the past from print to radio to TV and now to social, mobile, digital, et cetera.","As you go through each of these transformational changes, the amount and how you spend brand-building fundamentally changes. And so as we see people skipping more ads on TV, as we see people, particularly millennials, using their mobile devices, social media, et cetera, having a larger impact, we have to change our brand-building model. And as we do this, we have to both identify what's not working as well as it has in the past and where should we invest more money. Now, we're seeing very good ROIs on digital-type spend, so we're seeing more of our money migrate in that direction.","But because of this sea change, it's very hard for us to say where our brand-building is going in the future. I certainly feel like we spend enough money on brand-building. And so as we look, say, into 2016, we will have zero-based budgeting savings in brand-building. Some or all of that will get reinvested back into brand-building, but I don't think we need to continue to increase our brand-building as such. And so our brand-building as a percentage of sales may be flat, may even decline slightly, but don't take that as a lack of commitment to brand-building. Take that as a recognition that how you build brands, how you engage with consumers as they engage with media differently, is changing at such a pace here that we have to reevaluate our entire model and continue to push the edge on how much we need to spend to build these great brands.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, John. That's helpful. And then secondly, I just wanted to come back to the comparability issues you've been facing in the Cracker category, specifically on the Cracker Chips, because it feels like we've been talking about it for a few quarters. We probably should now be starting to approach the point where we could start lapping some of those distribution losses. How are you thinking about the ability of that dynamic to be a tailwind next year or should we simply be looking for the headwind to moderate or normalize?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we have renovated our Special K Cracker Chip business. And that has resulted in velocity stabilizing, so now we're just lapping lost distribution. There may be parts of that business that also get eliminated over time. We come back to a stronger core number of SKUs. So it's certainly becoming less of a headwind. It's been a pretty major headwind across this year. So it'll probably be there, but to a lesser degree in 2016.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I want to come back to the question on Venezuela. Can you give us, first, can you quantify? I'm not sure how Spillane got his math on this one. I probably just haven't read in the detail he has on this one, but what the bottom-line hit was on Venezuela translation this quarter? And also, how much the pricing in Venezuela contributed to organic sales growth, or said differently, what would LatAm organic sales look like if Venezuela was not in the base?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so first of all, in Venezuela, let me remind you of how that remeasurement has impacted our results. And then, as well, there's a translational impact. So in the second quarter, we took a significant charge as a result of our revaluing our balance sheet. We took a small charge as well in the third quarter for about $0.41 of earnings per share impact. It's more the transactional impact of remeasuring that business. Also in the third quarter, we would've taken the translational impact of remeasuring that business to the 200 bolivar to the U.S. dollar. And that's roughly around $0.04 or so of earnings per share impact. And, as I said, in terms of a sales impact, it was a little less than half of that 10 point impact to sales.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As you think about what's happening in Latin America generally, there's no question that Venezuela drove the sales growth you saw in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, local currency growth ex-Venezuela would be up low single digits. But it's worth remembering within that, that our Pringles business is a U.S. dollar-denominated business. And so what you're seeing there is actually U.S. dollar growth in Pringles, as opposed to true local currency growth. Local currency Pringles was up strong double digits, but that obviously translates to very low U.S. dollar performance, given where the exchange rates have moved.","So it's actually kind of hard within our results to get back to a pure local currency ex-Venezuela for Latin America. What I would say in Latin America is we are seeing a slowdown in economies in Latin America in general, and in our business as well. We are gaining share in key businesses, such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia. As we go into 2016, we expect this business to continue to be challenged a little bit with the macroeconomic headwinds of the exchange rate movements and how that's impacting consumer demand in the region.","Simon D. Burton - Vice President-Investor Relations","Gary, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. I appreciate it. Just a follow-up on the headwinds that you're facing kind of in the U.S. business, one is Kashi, which you're starting to transform and renovate. And the other, obviously, is in the cracker chips side, where you're up against some difficult comps, which was a previous question just recently. If you exclude the negative impact of Kashi on U.S. Morning Foods and the Cracker Chip business in your U.S. Snack business, what would your organic sales growth rates have been?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Eric, I don't have that math to hand. But I think it is fair to say that we have some headwinds this year that, in some respects, masks our underlying performance and as we go into 2016 with those headwinds. And I think that's another reason why we have confidence that we are building momentum and will be a better position as we go into 2016.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Maybe we'll drill down that further in your Analyst Day. And then, the next question is probably for Ron. Ron, obviously, you're generating more free cash this year. I know that this year is your peak cash spending for Project K. You've got some more, I think, in 2016 and 2017. But $350 million of cash costs this year, and maybe you gave this number. I don't have it. What are your cash costs expected for Project K next year? What would be additive to cash next year from just lower cash costs for Project K 2016?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So first, Project K, after-tax cash for the entire four-year project is about $1 billion. That includes capital spending and the other elements of cash to execute the program. More than half of that will have occurred through 2015 business. So we were well over $200 million last year, approximately $350 million this year. So our cash requirements are a bit less as we move into 2016 and 2017 and then closing up in 2018. Just a thing and I think it's important to note in both 2014 and 2015, we focused on our working capital improvements and essentially we have been able to offset that impact of the increased cash for Project K through working capital improvements and specifically the supplier-financing initiative.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Simon Burton for any closing remarks.","Simon D. Burton - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us. We'll be around for the next few days to answer any questions.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Emily. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for a review of our third quarter 2013 results. I'm joined here today by John Bryant, President and CEO; Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer; and Alistair Hirst, Senior Vice President of Global Supply Chain. The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, November 7. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","Now I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported results for the third quarter, and we also announced Project K, a significant multiyear growth and efficiency program. I'll say more about this in a few minutes. Internal sales growth was 0.5% in the quarter, which was below our original expectation. As you've all seen in the public data, center-of-the-store categories in the U.S. continue to see weak consumption data, and it certainly had an effect on our performance. Our operating profit exceeded our expectations, as we saw relatively less pressure in cost of goods and good performance in SG&A. And in addition to this, we also benefited below the line and posted comparable earnings of $0.95 per share, which was ahead of our estimate. This is the first full quarter that Pringles is in the base, and the integration is now largely complete. The business continued to perform well in Q3, and we saw double-digit sales growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. While sales were slower in the U.S. as a result of comparisons to last year, consumption continued to be strong. So we've managed the situation well in the third quarter and delivered good operating profit and earnings results, although our net sales performance was a little softer than we had expected.","Project K is a natural next step in the evolution of our company. To put this initiative into context, let's turn to Slide 4 and a review of our strategy, which we announced in early 2011. We remain focused on 4 key areas: Cereal, Snacks, Frozen Foods and emerging markets, and these areas will receive even more attention as a result of Project K. First of all, we have large core Cereal businesses that have long-term growth potential, and we are committed to driving these categories and our global share leadership. These businesses are always competitive. We must stay focused on investing in growth and competing effectively. We've faced some challenges in the last couple of years, but we know that proven ideas, investment in our brands and good in-store execution drive our categories and fuel our sustainable growth operating principle.","Secondly, we are committed to becoming a global player in Snacks, and the acquisition of Pringles accelerated this transition. Pringles brought with it expertise that we can leverage and opportunities that we can unlock across the organization. With the integration largely behind us, we believe that we can more fully leverage these opportunities.","Third, we have a large and growing Frozen Food business in North America. And finally, we have the opportunity to further expand our footprint in developing and emerging markets. Project K will enable us to invest in our brands and execute our strategy.","Now let's go into the project in more detail; specifically, how we will drive efficiency and effectiveness, the size of the opportunity and our reinvestment priorities, starting with Slide 5. We've always had a focus on continuous improvement as a company. Project K is an opportunity to step back from our business and identify larger structural efficiency and effectiveness opportunities. And as a result of this review, we have found opportunities in 4 areas. First, the project will drive a more global structure by creating and empowering global category teams and regional hubs. Second, it will build capabilities and drive functional efficiencies. Third, it will build the global supply chain of the future, focusing on optimizing our infrastructure, including the consolidation of certain sites and production lines, as Alistair will discuss in a minute. And finally, it will implement a global business service model, which will streamline our end-to-end transactional processes.","Let's turn to Slide 6, which shows the financial highlights of the plan and gives you some idea of its scale. We expect that total cumulative pretax charges over the life of the program will be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, with approximately 2\/3 coming in supply chain. Of this total, $17 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2013, and we expect that we'll recognize between $175 million and $200 million for the full year, or approximately $0.35 to $0.40 per share. Savings in 2013 are expected to be minimal. Project K is designed to decrease long-term structural costs, and therefore, it will take some time to realize the benefits fully. As a result, we expect pretax charges in 2014 to be higher than we'll see in later years and savings to be lower. We'll give you more detail on the Q4 call when we give full year 2014 guidance. We'll also give you more clarity on capital expenditure on the fourth quarter call, but our initial estimates are that CapEx will be between 4% and 5% of sales for the next couple of years.","We anticipate that pretax savings will reach an annual run rate of between $425 million and $475 million by 2018. These savings will also be divided approximately 2\/3 to COGS and 1\/3 to SG&A, and essentially, all will be cash. As a result, we expect a very good rate of return of approximately 30% from the investment.","Finally, we expect that the applicable tax rate for the project will be similar to or slightly below our corporate tax rate. As you can see, this is a significant initiative and is one that will drive our sustainable growth operating model over time.","Let's turn to Slide 7 and our priorities for reinvestment. Our investment is aligned with the strategy I reviewed earlier. First, we will reinvest in brand building in our core Cereal businesses. For example, we've got some great ideas for supporting our strongest brand, Kellogg's, in the Cereal category in developed markets and around the world. We will also increase investment in developing and emerging markets, where we have even greater growth potential. This will include investing in brand building, capacity and increased R&D resources. And we'll also invest in global category teams, which will enable faster development and implementation of category growth initiatives. And finally, on our increased investment in brand building. We know that brand building and innovation drive our categories. This will include traditional advertising, but we'll also focus on increasing levels of digital engagement with consumers and other areas where we've validated the returns. And we'll also drive better in-store execution to bring our programs to life in store.","Now let me turn it over to Ron for some financial details on the quarter.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 shows our performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods. These results exclude charges for Project K. Internal sales increased by 0.5 points. As John mentioned, our sales were lower than expected in some developed markets, particularly in the U.S., as you've seen in the consumption data. However, we did see good internal sales growth in all the other regions of the world, with Europe up 3.3%, Asia-Pacific up 2.9% and Latin America up 6.7%. Underlying internal operating profit increased by 0.6 point. These results include mid-single-digit growth in advertising; cost inflation, net of productivity, consistent with our expectations; and cost containment, which drove savings in certain areas of SG&A that exceeded our expectations.","Comparable earnings per share, which excludes integration costs and the impact of Project K, were $0.95 per share, ahead of our expectations due to the SG&A cost containment, a lower tax rate and a lower currency headwind. Comparable growth was 2.2%.","Now let's turn to Slide 9, which shows the quarter's sales growth. Reported sales declined slightly, but internal sales growth was 0.5 points, with Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Europe all contributing good growth, as I mentioned earlier. Internal volumes declined slightly, driven by the softer category sales we mentioned in the U.S. However, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America all posted volume growth, and all of the regions posted good improvement in price mix in the quarter. The impact of currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.6 points in the quarter. We expected our sales growth to improve as we progressed through the second half due to the innovation launched at the end of the second quarter and increased consumer marketing. Our innovation is doing well, but other parts of our portfolio, specifically within U.S. Cereal and U.S. Snacks, are softer than planned.","Slide 10 shows the shape of the net inflation over the second half of the year. As expected, we saw some cost inflation net of productivity improvements in the third quarter. This followed a period in the first half of the year when we saw significant inflation. The inflation was the largest driver of margin performance in the quarter, but we also saw reduced operating leverage resulting from the slower sales growth.","Our underlying reported gross margin declined by 20 basis points, a sequential improvement from Q2, due to the lower cost inflation I mentioned and the fact that Pringles is now completely included in last year's base. As we've said before, we have good visibility into our cost structure for the fourth quarter, and we still expect net deflation. But we are seeing some adverse impact from lower operating leverage due to softer sales in the U.S.","Slide 11 shows the quarterly underlying internal operating profit performance for each of the regions. As a reminder, the operating profit growth on the chart excludes charges for Project K. Underlying internal operating profit for the total company increased by 0.6 points, which was ahead of expectations and included a mid-single-digit increase in investment in advertising.","North America's underlying internal operating profit decreased by 0.7 points. This was driven by sales declines in Morning Foods and Snacks, combined with increased investment in advertising, and was partially offset by cost containment measures. We expect fourth quarter sales to remain challenged in North America, but we're developing plans to invest behind our categories and improve in-store execution.","Underlying internal operating profit declined by 3.8% in Europe. This included a double-digit increase in advertising. We've invested behind innovation, and we restaged Special K across much of the region. That and a strong program on Pringles contributed to the significant increase in support in the third quarter.","In addition, we invested upfront costs in several efficiency initiatives in the region to drive future savings. Excluding these upfront costs, Europe's profit growth was more than 2%. Underlying internal operating profit in Latin America increased by almost 24% due to the strong sales growth and lower SG&A. And in Asia-Pacific, we saw an increase in underlying internal operating profit of 2.3%, driven primarily by sales growth and lower SG&A.","Slide 12 shows our cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations before capital spending was $1,389,000,000 over the first 3 quarters of the year. This was an increase of $14 million over the same period last year. Capital spending in the year-to-date period was $363 million, an increase of more than $100 million over last year. This was in line with our expectations, and we still expect spending for the full year to be slightly more than 4% of sales.","Our cash flow performance is tracking in line with our plan to deliver $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year, and we've decreased debt levels by approximately $900 million since the acquisition of Pringles.","Now let's look at Slide 13 and an update of our full year guidance. As a result of the slower sales growth we saw in the U.S., we expect that reported sales growth will be approximately 4% to 5%. This is lower than our previous guidance of approximately 5%. And we expect that underlying earnings per share will be at the lower end of the $3.75 to $3.84 range we showed you last quarter.","Our estimate for full year cost inflation remains approximately 5%, and the estimate for cost savings remains around 4%. And as I mentioned, we still expect to see net deflation in the fourth quarter. This deflation, combined with lower SG&A costs, contributes to the strong comparable earnings growth we expect in the fourth quarter.","Gross margin for the full year, excluding the impact of Project K, will be down approximately 100 basis points with the decline split equally between the impact of dilution from Pringles and performance of the base business.","Slide 14 shows a bit more detail regarding our full year earnings guidance. As you can see, previous guidance, including the impact of currency but excluding integration costs, was $3.75 to $3.84 per share. We're still in that range, although, as you can see, currencies have improved by $0.03, which has been offset by sales softness. So we continue to be in the range but toward the lower end.","We also expect to recognize approximately $0.35 to $0.40 of charges this year related to Project K. This charge will not have a material cash impact in 2013. We estimate that approximately 85% of the 2013 charge will be in cost of goods sold and the remainder will be in SG&A. When we provide guidance for next year on the fourth quarter call, we will give you visibility into the costs associated with Project K for 2014.","Now let's turn to Slide 15. We now expect that the full year tax rate will be approximately 29%, and we estimate that interest expense will still be between $230 million and $240 million. As I mentioned, we also continue to expect annual cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, including Project K. Total capital spending, including the additional capital we need due to the growth of Pringles, will be slightly more than 4% of sales, consistent with previous guidance. We continue to expect that integration costs related to the acquisition of Pringles will be between $0.12 and $0.14 per share and synergies to be toward the high end of our $50 million to $75 million range for the year. And finally, note that our earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of adjustments for mark-to-market for commodities and pensions, integration costs and Project K costs.","And now I'll turn it over to Alistair for a discussion on our supply chain.","Alistair D. Hirst","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off today with a couple of slides that I showed you last November at the Analyst Day in Chicago. The first is Slide 17 and our vision for supply chain. We have a highly capable team delivering high-quality food and delighting consumers and customers. The key for us is that we do all these with a low-cost supply chain, and we've made great progress over the last couple of years in these areas, as I mentioned in November. Importantly, the Project K program we announced today will help us achieve our goals in a number ways, which I'll discuss in more detail in a minute.","Now if you'll turn to Slide 18, you'll see another familiar slide. The Right to Play was our focus in 2012 as we looked to drive improvement in 4 fundamentals: food safety, people safety, customer service and financial excellence. We've made significant progress in all these areas and built a dependable foundation for the organization, and Project K will enable us to do even more. Next is the Right to Win, which involves a number of goals, including the implementation of Kellogg Work Systems, or KWS. KWS is very important to us, as it helps to drive 0 waste using a standard operating model while improving employee involvement, and it's even more important to us now as we begin Project K. In fact, having KWS in place is one of the major differences between Project K and other cost reduction programs.","And finally on this slide, Right to Lead. We want to be dependable, but we also want to be agile and able to manage complexity. We want to enable sales growth while maintaining a focus on profitability, and we want to do all these while maintaining the safety of our food and our people and while remaining responsive to our customer. Project K is an enabler of the work that needs to be done for us to achieve this vision.","Slide 19 is a reminder of some of the financial goals that are part of the company's operating model. As you know, we target between 3% and 4% productivity improvement each year. That's a significant commitment by the supply chain organization and is one that we've got a great track record of achieving, and that commitment will continue even as we progress through the multiyear Project K initiative. Our long-term target is for capital expenditure of between 3% and 4% of sales. And over the last couple of years, we've increased the amount of investment in growth. This is the trend that we intend to continue in the future. It is worth noting that over the next couple of years, Project K will likely increase the overall level of capital expenditure to between 4% and 5% of sales.","And finally, I've also put the impact of Project K on the slide. This is the total amount of savings we expect from the program, not just supply chain's contribution, although supply chain's contribution is meaningful. The important thing to note here is that the $425 million to $475 million in annual savings is incremental because it's largely coming from structural cost opportunities. It will be achieved in addition to our normal run rate of productivity, which is driven by continuous improvement programs.","Now let's turn to Slide 20 and a few specifics of our Project K and the supply chain organization. As you can see, we have 3 main goals: aligning the network, organizing the supply chain for success and implementing global business services. Let me talk briefly about each. First, we must properly align the network to the realities of the marketplace and the requirements of our customers. This means making sure that we have the right infrastructure, including the right number of plants, the right kind and number production lines and that they're in the right locations. And obviously, we need to anticipate future needs while designing the network. So all of this will lead to the consolidation of certain sites and production lines and the relocation of others. It is never an easy process, but it's one that is necessary for the long-term health of the business. Secondly, we will organize a supply chain structure for success. This will allow us to do more with less through the use of more standardized processes and a more streamlined organization. A small and more agile team will lead to less complexity and will allow us to be more responsive to the needs of our customer and the changing competitive landscape. As you can imagine, this will involve the move to regional hubs, which will put resources closer to the plants.","And finally, we will implement global business services. This is the transformation of common processes or services that are currently being addressed by different functions in various regions. This will be a multiyear process, but we're already driving other significant transformations that will improve our procurement and engineering functions and also our core manufacturing network, as we highlighted at the analyst meeting. We're 1 year into the transformation, and procurement is already providing 1.5x the lift over traditional level of savings. Successful sourcing of low-cost engineering solutions is driving change in the operating model, and as a result, we're getting more for each dollar we spend. These improvements have been significant contributors to our 3% to 4% savings goals. This process will lead to reduced complexity and increased efficiency and will be the main driver of the Right to Lead initiative that I mentioned earlier.","So finally, on Slide 21, a couple of words on Project K in general. Project K is a very different kind of efficiency and effective program. The primary source of savings will be from consolidating facilities and eliminating excess capacity. It will not be from reducing headcount in our operating plants. It is designed to drive a more effective organization. It will reduce complexity while increasing our ability to execute, and we will maintain the levels of empowerment we've worked so hard to develop in supply chain.","In addition, this isn't a program limited to the supply chain organization; rather, supply chain is just one part of the initiative. Project K is a commitment by the whole company and is a major step toward achieving our broader goals. So I hope that you can see the potential we have in supply chain to support the company while on that journey. This is not an easy process, but it is essential if we are going to recognize our potential and meet our strategic goals.","And with that, I'll now turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Alistair. Now let's turn to Slide 22 and some detail regarding each of our businesses, starting with U.S. Morning Foods and Cereal. Both category and Kellogg's consumption were slightly lower than expected in the quarter. We're lapping strong share gain comparisons of 0.4 points in 2012, partially as a result of our strong Olympics-related program, and our share also grew by 0.5 points in the third quarter of 2011. So part of this quarter's performance was due to comps. However, we did experience a slower-than-expected recovery in our Kashi brand and continued challenges in the adult segment of the portfolio.","Our shipment performance was also lower than expected due to reduced trade inventories. In fact, we ended the quarter at the lowest level of trade inventories in the last 4 years. As we've discussed over the course of the year, we have launched innovation aimed at providing the progressive nutrition that older consumers are seeking. Raisin Bran did well as a result of the new Raisin Bran with Omega-3 and strong support from a healthy dividends campaign. Rice Krispies is also included in the healthy dividends campaign and also posted sales growth. And Special K Protein, which we launched last year, also posted sales growth and share gains in the quarter as consumers continue to seek new sources of protein.","Obviously, we need to do more to provide innovative nutrition, and we have plans for 2014 that will help us continue to address this broad consumer trend, including the introduction of new organic Kashi cereals, which include grains such as quinoa and some of which are gluten free.","As you know, we launched our new Special K Nourish Hot Cereals at midyear, and they are off to a good start, although it's still early. We're seeing strong sales growth recently, as the advertising support just began, and we have good brand building and merchandising support planned for the rest of the year. We also launched drinkable breakfast products at midyear, and we've seen encouraging initial results. ACV on these products is good, and we're on target to meet expectations. We're excited about this opportunity and some others as we focus more on the On the Go segment. We have additional activity planned for next year, as this is a segment that has strong potential through the convenience and portability of the products.","We have other great programs planned for 2014 as well. You'll remember our successful Kellogg's masterbrand advertising from the Summer Olympics last year, and we're pleased to be sponsoring the Winter Olympics next February. This will include strong activation across the portfolio and be followed in March with additional programs.","And finally for Morning Foods, Pop-Tarts had another excellent quarter as consumption increased by more than 7%. The Peanut Butter Pop-Tarts innovation we launched a few months ago is continuing to do very well, with good share and sales performance.","Now let's turn to Slide 23, which shows internal net sales performance of the U.S. Snacks segment. Internal sales in the cracker business declined in the quarter, although we saw good performance from our big 3 cracker brands, which posted consumption growth of 6% in combination. Our overall performance was the result of lower end market support and the impact of Special K Cracker Chips. Cracker Chips posted a sales decline due to difficult comparisons to the third quarter of last year resulting from the introduction of Popcorn Chips. The 2 cracker innovations that we launched early in Q3 are both doing well. Town House Pita has gained good share and is also having a positive impact on the growth of base Town House. And Cheez-It Zings saw a good share performance and benefited from a broader Cheez-It Game Day sponsorship in September of this year.","The cookie business posted a decline in the quarter. As we saw in the cracker business, some of the innovations that we launched recently, including Keebler Simply Made cookies, are off to a good start, and the total Keebler brand posted sales growth in the quarter. The wholesome snacks business was approximately flat in the quarter, as growth in the new Special K Pastry Crisps and Nutri-Grain Crunch bars was partially offset by lower sales of core Special K and Kashi bars.","Our Pringles business posted good consumption growth of approximately 3% in the third quarter, and it's worth noting that this performance was lapping very difficult comparisons from the third quarter of last year. We're optimistic about the fourth quarter's results due to the continued success of Pringles Stix and the launch of exciting innovation planned for introduction later in the quarter. As a reminder, Pringles is also a warehouse-delivered product and, similar to Cereal, saw a significant trade inventory reduction in the quarter. So while we saw consumption growth in the quarter, shipments were down at a mid-single-digit rate.","So the innovation we've launched in the Snacks business in the second half has done well, but our results have been disappointing. And as we've said before, we expect that the environment will remain difficult in the near term, but the team is doing a lot of work, and we expect that the business will improve over time.","Now let's look to Slide 24, and that's sales performance of the U.S. Specialty segment. As you can see, this business posted internal net sales growth of 6% in the third quarter. Growth was the result of distribution gains and a strong performance of Eggo and Nutri-Grain in the K-12 school business. In addition, the Foodservice business gained share in the cereal, cracker and health and wellness categories during the quarter, and we've also launched breakfast drinks in some of these channels. And Pringles continued its strong year-to-date performance with a double-digit net sales increase in Specialty Channels in the third quarter.","Slide 25 shows detail regarding the North America Other segment, which includes the Canadian and U.S. Frozen Food businesses. The segment posted an internal sales increase of 0.3% in the quarter. Internal net sales declined in the Frozen Foods business, as we're lapping very difficult double-digit comps in the third quarter of last year as a result of strong growth in both the Eggo brand and the veggie food business. Special K Flatbread Sandwiches, which were launched in the third quarter of last year, continue to perform well and drove growth in Q3 this year. And we recently launched a new Deluxe Egg and Cheese variety.","We continue to see good performance from Eggo Thick & Fluffy and Wafflers, which provide the benefits of portability and convenience. The burger segment of our veggie food business posted solid growth, and innovation in other segments also contributed. And in Canada, we saw low single-digit sales growth in the quarter. Pringles gained category share, as did the Canadian Frozen Food business as a result of the launch of Special K Flatbreads and Eggo Minis. And in Snacks, we gained share in the wholesome snacks segment as a result of innovation.","Now let's turn to Slide 26 and our international businesses. Internal net sales increased by 2.9% in Asia-Pacific. The Australian business posted low single-digit internal sales growth. The Indian, Southeast Asian and Pringles businesses all posted good rates of growth in the period. In fact, Pringles grew at a double-digit rate. We launched Pringles in a smaller can in Southeast Asia, and the early signs have been encouraging. Kellogg Europe posted internal net sales growth of 3.3% in the third quarter. Western Europe grew as distribution of our new Nutri-Grain handheld breakfast products increased on the continent, and Pringles posted great results as the successful summer commercial program resonated with the consumers. We also made progress with the relaunch of Special K in the region and are seeing improving trends. Obviously, Southern Europe remains challenging, given the difficult economic conditions there.","And in Latin America, we saw strong internal net sales growth of 6.7% in the quarter. Central America, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the Pringles business all posted growth. In fact, the Pringles business grew at double-digit rate. The economic environment in Mexico continues to be difficult, although we have achieved good share positions in the Cereal category in recent public data. Also, around the region, we've launched innovation, including new Zucaritas and Choco Krispies in Central America and Special K and Nutri-Grain in Puerto Rico.","So to summarize, we saw good operating profit and earnings performance in the third quarter. However, we did see weaker top line growth than we were expecting, and some of our categories remain challenging. We're working hard to improve this performance, and an important step is the announcement of Project K. This is a major initiative for us, and we're excited by the opportunities we see for the investment and increased growth.","Now I'll open up to questions before coming back with a brief summary.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So on Project K, I was curious about goals around advertising as a percent of sales and new product development as a percent of sales. Is there anything you can tell us about where you're at right now, where you might be going on either of those metrics?","John A. Bryant","Alexia, we haven't provided guidance on those specific metrics. And as we look at reinvestment back in the business, the reinvestments, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in 2014, are really focused on our core Cereal business and making some investments in emerging markets, as well as some capabilities within the business. We haven't set reinvestment for 2015, '16 and '17. Obviously, as we go along, we'll determine the best place to make those reinvestments. But at this stage, the primary focus of our reinvestment is to stabilize and rebuild momentum in our core businesses. We believe we do that through brand building, innovation, nutrition over time. That's where we're focusing. So we would expect to continue to improve our brand building as a percent of sales as we go forward.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Lazar, Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, I remember -- I think it was this past February at CAGNY where -- I think it was during the Q&A, and it was right after all the 3G announcements and things, where you had mentioned some of the discussions you'd had with the board around giving them a sense of what the implications were of some of the news at the time. And one of things that you came away with was if food companies left opportunities on the table, then it was more likely that others would take advantage of those opportunities for you. And I'm trying to get a sense, is some of this basically getting after, more aggressively, some of those opportunities? And do you view this as more offensive in -- based on where you benchmark, this gets you sort of ahead of where peers might be, or somewhat more defensive around it just gets you to catch up to where your benchmarking says others are?","John A. Bryant","Andrew, first, this is just the natural evolution, the next step in our strategy. If you look back over the last few years, in 2011, we reinvested back in our supply chain, and that part of our business has been performing incredibly well ever since. And in fact, the investments that we made at that time are now enabling us to do some of the Project K initiatives. Then we come forward from that, and we acquired Pringles, which enabled us to become, truly, a global player in Snacks. And we reimplemented SAP at the same time. As we come into 2013, 2014, we challenged ourselves to step back from the business and look for structural cost opportunities that we can retake and reinvest back in our business to drive the momentum and the brand building investment that we need to drive to get ourselves back on track. And that's really what we're doing here. It really has nothing to do with 3G highs. It just happens to be occurring at a similar point in time. It's all about investing in our strategies we took you through before and setting ourselves up for the future.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, I guess, it seems like the free cash flow impact is pretty significant between the cash cost to the restructuring and the raised CapEx. Is that fair, and is that -- like kind of, what are the implications to that in terms of your share repo or dividend growth rates? Maybe you could just touch on that, and then I have some follow-up.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, Eric. First, recall what I said was that the cash impact in 2013 is going to be relatively minimal. As you can appreciate, there are some cash investments upfront associated with capital and the other investments we're making to generate savings as well, and then the cash savings will build or improve over time. And as a foundation, we do generate strong cash within the business. But we do expect that our debt levels could increase up to $0.5 billion over the next 2 to 3 years. Now we are working on an initiative in accounts payable, and this isn't embedded at this point in time, that might provide us some cash benefit. In terms of impact to our dividend and share repurchase programs, we do not expect any impact at this point in time. Instead, we expect the debt levels to go up slightly.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, John, is there any sense -- I realize you're kind of putting this together, but I think it was mentioned that a lot of the savings here were supposed to be incremental, but obviously, the competitive environment is more difficult. So is it fair to say, on the back of this, that your long-term growth targets on the bottom line of high single-digit performance growth is unchanged?","John A. Bryant","Yes, Eric, at this stage, we're making no changes to our long-term growth guidance: high single-digit EPS.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And last one, I guess maybe to Alistair, or John, maybe you want to take it. But obviously, K-LEAN was quite, in some respects, damaging to the company. Why is this one different, and why should investors have faith that Project K is going to be a much better outcome than the challenges that K-LEAN ultimately resulted?","Alistair D. Hirst","First, let me say that it's not just a supply chain initiative, as we just laid out. So 2\/3 of it, yes, will be delivered by supply chain, but it's an enterprise-wide initiative. It's also over 4 years. And so that gives us the ability, particularly for the supply chain part, to appropriately plan, resource, phase and pace each part of the project. It's also across the global supply chain network, so allowing us to leverage our global resource base and not being biased to one particular region or particular business units. The project gets its structural fixed cost in our underutilized asset base over the 4 years. So that's one of the big differences to the previous K-LEAN initiatives, which, really, was a wide-ranging headcount reduction within the plants. So this is very targeted to assets, to lines and to plants. And while that's very difficult, it's the right thing to do to be driving our long-term growth. So it is a very different point of entry from the previous initiatives that we've carried out as a company.","Operator","Our next question is from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","John, the center-of-the-store packaged food universe has been weak for quite a while now, and it seems to continue to be weak. What gives you the confidence that the investments that you make with Project K can change that, especially when you look at what you said in your prepared remarks: the innovation did well, but the underlying -- or the core business didn't do well? So your innovation and the promotions and advertising that come with it just seem to cannibalize the existing business that you have. So why would Project K change that trajectory?","John A. Bryant","I think, if you look at our business right now, we're actually seeing some good growth in the international businesses. We're seeing some good growth here in the U.S. in specialty and in our Frozen Foods business over a period of time. The real challenge for us, really, is in Morning Foods and in Snacks. And in fact, within Snacks, the categories are doing okay. We have an opportunity to be more competitive and so invest more behind that business. On Cereal, we were growing Cereal low single digits across most of the 2000s. We did that when driving the adult portion of the portfolio. We had Kashi and Special K firing at all cylinders, and I think we can get back to that situation again. I wouldn't say the 2000s was a period of high growth within the packaged food business within center store either, but we've demonstrated the ability to grow that business low single digit in a number of different environments, and I think we can get back to that in the future.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But just to pick up on your example of Snacks, again, it seems like your innovation is cannibalizing the existing business that you have. How can you avoid that going forward?","John A. Bryant","If you look at the innovation on Cheez-It and Town House in Snacks in the third quarter, it's actually driving both of those businesses, with Cheez-It up about 5%, 6% and Town House actually up 20% in the third quarter. So we are seeing some good growth there. I think, if anything, the issue that we have on Snacks is the Special K Cracker Chips were such a big innovation last year, it's hard to sustain that. That size, that's coming down a little bit. That's weighing upon the -- on the Snacks business. So I think the trick here on innovation is to ensure the innovation is sustainable and to invest behind it over time. To invest behind it over time, you need more brand building. Hence, Project K gives us the funding to keep the brand building behind the innovation to sustain it in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, first off, the program, from my point of view, seems like a good response to the environment, so congratulations on that announcement. I want to ask a little bit about the fourth quarter. Specifically, when I just look at kind of what's implied by the guidance, to get to the low end of your sales range, you have to have a fairly sizable decline in total revenues in the fourth quarter to get to the full year minus 4%. I think fourth quarter has to be -- sorry, for the full year to be up 4%, you have to have, I think, minus 4% in the fourth quarter. If I've done my math right, can you just talk a little bit about how that will work its way through the different divisions? I almost feel like it's got to be negative growth across every one of your major geographies, just given the size of that figure. So can you spend a moment and talk about Q4?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, David. Remember, we guided sales at a range of 4% to 5%, down from the approximate 5% that we guided in the third quarter. So as we looked at our year-to-date performance, we synced up or adjusted Q4 to be more in line. So we are expecting internal growth in sales in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do see some challenges, particularly in the U.S., around our U.S. Cereal business and the Snacks business, but we're making the appropriate actions to get those back on track in the future. And then when you look at the growth from an operating profit and earnings per share standpoint, I think it's important to understand that we have the internal sales growth we're expecting, consistent with our year-to-date trends, and that we have the net deflation as well, which is providing a benefit to us in cost structure. It's allowing us to get confidence in our operating profit and earnings per share expectations.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I just follow up, though, your guidance is on reported net sales, and you just were talking about internal net sales. If you hit the bottom end of that reported net sales number, your year-to-date number is like plus 6%.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Don't forget there's a little currency headwind as well in the fourth quarter, David.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How big is that?","Ronald L. Dissinger","The currency headwind's a little less than 1 point.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question for me is just on brand building. What's your full year expectations? And then, have you changed your fourth quarter brand building plans?","John A. Bryant","David, on the advertising for the year, we expect advertising to essentially be flat year-on-year. It's up if you include the Pringles acquisition, but if you back out the Pringles acquisition, it's essentially flat. Within that, obviously, we have efficiency programs. We believe the underlying performance of the program is actually up, but in absolute dollars, it's relatively flat year-on-year.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think on the second quarter call, you had discussed some innovation in Europe coming to market in the back half of the year. As I think about the pacing of the top line in Europe, it was pretty impressive this quarter. How should we look at the impact of that innovation on 3Q versus 4Q? In other words, was there anything in terms of temporary sell-ins, promotions, et cetera, that may have affected the timing of shipments versus consumption this period in Europe?","John A. Bryant","Well, Ken, I think we're very pleased with the European performance in the third quarter. I think this represents now 3 quarters of growth over the last 4 in what's a very, very difficult environment in Europe. The big driver of the European performance in the third quarter was actually Pringles behind a very strong summer promotion program as opposed to a sell-in behind innovation on the breakfast side of the business. Having said that, I don't think we'll have the same level of growth in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had a question for you on Project K. And I want to understand, as you look ahead, even looking out to the end of the program or later years of the program, do you expect any of these savings to benefit the bottom line, where you actually would have these savings benefiting earnings? And maybe related to that, in the short run, is there a heavier level of reinvestment that you want to get at, maybe it's in 2014 or even '15, relative to the savings that come through from the program? Will there be a timing differential there, essentially?","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Chris. Our goal with this program is to reinvest back in our business and to gain momentum in our business and get back on our sustainable growth model, and we'll continue to reinvest back in the business until we see that happen. And so I think that's going to be over the next few years. So I think it's very hard for us to predict today what might be happening in 2017, 2018. We haven't given 2014 guidance yet. We'll do that in the fourth quarter conference call. It is fair to say, because these are structural cost changes, they take time to execute and see the savings come through, so the 2014 savings will be meaningfully lower than the normal run rate of savings that we'll achieve in later years.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I had a follow-up question, if I could, or a second question on the lower inventory levels you mentioned being at very low levels -- I think it was in the U.S. was the reference. I wondered, are you likely to hold at those levels, just given the sluggishness of the category? Will retailers hold less inventory in this environment because of that?","John A. Bryant","We are planning to hold at those low inventories, so we haven't built into expectations inventories jump back up again, but they are unusually low at the end of the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, 2 questions. John, I was wondering, in U.S. Cereal, if I exclude Pop-Tarts and the beverage business, can I assume that U.S. Cereal was down about 5% or so? And how much of that is due to the tough comp to year-ago Summer Olympics? And then the other part of the question is -- when you had K-LEAN, I remember there was a 3-year executive performance plan that was entirely based on executing K-LEAN. And I think what happens is, if you incentivize executives to cut costs, they will cut costs. And I wanted to know how Project K is going to be integrated into your 3-year program. Have you learned from that experience?","John A. Bryant","Rob, if I come back to your first question about the performance of the Cereal business, I think the category is down around 3% to 4%, and our consumption is down around 5%. So I think if we hadn't had the Olympics in the year prior, we probably would have done in line with, if not better than, the underlying category. So that's what's going on in terms of the numbers within Cereal. On the executive compensation and Project K, we do not have an executive compensation program beyond our normal compensation programs. Our normal compensation programs focus on net sales, operating profit, cash flow, both in the year which we're in, as well as on a 3-year period. And I believe those programs are consistent to drive the right motivation and behavior behind executing Project K flawlessly.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So there's no change to your EPP related to Project K. It'll be your normal measurements.","John A. Bryant","That is correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, it sounds like there's a lot of change going on within the organization. I was hoping you could elaborate more with some additional detail, maybe what change Paul is bringing to the organization in his new role; your global category teams, can you elaborate more on the structure, the roles, responsibilities; and then also, on global business services, what services are being folded into this global model?","John A. Bryant","Sure, Jason. Let me take part of the changes in the company over the last few years, and I'll hand it over to Ron to talk about global businesses services. If you step back and look at our company over the last 3 years, we've made some pretty significant changes to our leadership team. We have had a number of very experienced leaders come in from other companies on our international businesses, with an ex-Colgate executive running our Latin American business, ex-Cadbury running our Asia-Pacific business. And with the Pringles acquisition, we also got some great talent into the company, and now we have Chris Hood, who came out of Pringles, running our European business. We feel very good about those changes. At the same time, what we've done is we have eliminated a level in our organization. We've taken out the Kellogg North America and Kellogg International president roles. I think that enables us to execute faster and execute better by just allowing the underlying international area presidents and business unit presidents in North America to make decisions and move quickly. However, we also recognized it's not just bad execution, it's about creating the future of the company. And that's why we created the Chief Growth Officer role. That's Paul Norman's new role. That role has, reporting to it, the 2 global category teams that I mentioned this morning, as well as the Chief Marketing Officer, the Head of R&D, as well as the Head of Communications for the company. And the objective of that team is really to help us create the future, to create the category plans that will help us drive our Cereal category, drive our Snacks category and step up, and we'll get a longer-term innovation pipeline and idea stream so that we are driving to the future of the business, not just executing as much in the short term. So I believe this is the right structure. It enables us to balance between the need to create the future and deliver today. So they're the primary organizational changes in place. Ron, do you want to talk a little bit about global business services?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Absolutely. So as you're probably aware, Jason, this is not a new concept. A number of other companies have gone down this path. The intent is to create a much more efficient and effective basis for our processes and to standardize those processes across the globe. So some examples of the processes would include thing like purchase-to-pay or procure-to-pay, the order-to-cash process as well. This point in time, there are really 4 functions that are involved in this global business services initiative: finance, human resources, IT and supply chain. Of course, intent is to enable these processes by technology, and we believe that it will set us up with an extraordinarily strong foundation for the future in this area.","Operator","Our next question is from Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo Securities.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned about the expectation of about $0.5 billion increase in debt to fund Project K. Can you tell us if you expect that to result in your leverage ratio, debt-to-EBITDA being roughly flat as EBITDA grows and if you expect there to be much of an impact on your credit rating long term?","Ronald L. Dissinger","In terms of impact, obviously, we continue to generate very strong cash flow. And our expectation, though debt levels will rise, is to pay down that debt over time and maintain our credit rating at this point.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And do you expect those costs to be front-loaded or loaded more towards 2014 than -- or balanced throughout the course of the program?","Ronald L. Dissinger","It'll be a little bit more front-loaded, which is why I mentioned that we might see our debt levels go up over the next 2 to 3 years by about $0.5 billion. As you can imagine, we're making the investments, both P&L-type investments and capital spending-type investments, more at the front of the program to generate the savings over the 4-year period.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Ramey of Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just an observation. One of the things you did really super well with Kashi over the 10 or 12 years that you've owned it is keep the authenticity to the brand and keep influentials onboard with it. And I was just thinking about the Raisin Bran with flaxseed, which influentials will be quick to say, oh, that's the wrong Omega-3. And I just wonder if that's sort of part of the problem at the center of the grocery store, that we're not sort of honing in on the things that consumers are actually looking for but kind of going for the headline look but not the performance.","John A. Bryant","I guess the good news, Tim, is the Raisin Bran Omega-3 is doing well, and Raisin Bran's in growth behind both that innovation, as well as the broader healthy dividends campaign. So we've demonstrated the ability to engage consumers on that key messaging with those core Kellogg equities such as Raisin Bran. I think on Kashi, you're absolutely right. I mean, Kashi has been a great source of growth over many years, and our opportunity on Kashi is to push it back towards that pioneering nutrition. It became a little bit too mainstream. That's one of the reasons why we have an issue with Kashi right now and why we are innovating more towards those forward-leaning nutritionists, the people who are on the edge of the nutrition, forward thinkers, forward leaners, however you want to describe them. And so parts of our portfolio will do that, and other parts of our portfolio will be more mainstream.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What makes Kellogg somewhat unique is your portfolio across geographies have a great degree of similarities. So I guess my question is, really, what drove the disparity between international and domestic growth? Was it management issues? Was it product innovation? Was it a change in category dynamics? Am I missing something? Can you just help us out with that? Because it's such a discrepancy between the 2, but yet your portfolios are generally similar across the globe.","John A. Bryant","Well, Ken, I think it has, in part, to do with the development of the markets. So we saw, say, in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, growth in both Cereal and in Snacks. We saw growth in Snacks in Europe but not growth in Cereal. And obviously, we're struggling a little bit here in the U.S. So I think it has to do with the developing, emerging nature of the markets in Latin America and in Asia-Pacific, as well as -- Pringles is a slightly bigger percentage of some of those regions than, we'll just say, in the U.S. So we have some additional Pringles benefit there as well.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you don't think it's anything with an innovation or a structural issue within the company?","John A. Bryant","No. If anything, I would say that the work we do in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, say, on Cereal is more category-building in nature. And quite frankly, you come back and look at our U.S. Cereal business, I think that's where we have an opportunity to do more category-building work. If you look at the pressures on the U.S. Cereal category, it's actually not so much pressure within the category as pressure from categories around Cereal. I think we, as manufacturers in Cereal, have the opportunity to step up and reengage consumers on why cereal was such a good benefit at the breakfast occasion. I think we can do more of that in the U.S. Quite frankly, we already do that in some of the emerging markets.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question related to Project K and your sustainable growth model. I guess, in looking at it -- at the impact from Project K, it just seems like, especially with taking capacity out and closing plants, does it actually make your model a little less volume dependent? I mean, I think one of the things, one of the sort of challenges for Kellogg over the last year or 2 has just been it is a very revenue-dependent, volume-dependent business model, and sales growth has been slow. So I guess, does it give you a little extra flexibility? To the extent that achieving a 3% to 4% revenue growth goal is challenged because the environment is challenged, does this actually give you a little more flexibility than you have currently?","John A. Bryant","Bryan, I think if you look over the next few years, it's likely that our sales growth will probably be a little below that 3% to 4% growth because we're building momentum back into the business. As you go forward and we have the sustainable growth model working the way we want it to work, I think we should be looking at fairly balanced sources of growth between volume, price and mix. Obviously, over the next few years, I think volume will be a little bit harder to come by as we're driving that sustainable growth model and reinvesting back in the business.","Operator","Our last question is from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, in terms of the Project K, one of your stated goals here is to reduce excess capacity. Are there any product categories which you would think about in particular where excess capacity exists? Is it fair to say some exists in Cereal?","John A. Bryant","I think it is fair to say that, in a market like North America, we have excess capacity in the Cereal network.","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. Our strategy hasn't changed. As you know, last year, as part of that strategy, we acquired Pringles, which opened up additional opportunities for growth. We have some businesses around the world that are performing well and are gaining category share. We're seeing great results in the Pringles business in an exciting category. We have some great ideas for investing, both in innovation and in brand building, and we have some white spaces in which we can invest and drive new source of growth. We need to pursue the opportunities we have in our existing businesses and categories and in new areas of growth. So as a result, we've announced Project K, a significant growth and efficiency program. With it, we will change the cost structure of the company. We will invest in each of our strategic priorities, and over the long term, we will focus our investment in those areas where we expect to see the most growth in the years to come. This a difficult process, but Project K is a pragmatic program designed to be a catalyst for future growth, and it's the right thing to do for the company over the long term.","So as I conclude, I'd just like to say thank you to the Kellogg employees around the world. They are the heart and soul of this company, and it's their hard work that will drive the company's success in the years to come. Thank you.","Simon Burton","Thanks, everyone. We'll be around the rest of the day to have further discussions. Thanks again.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

So thank you, Simon. And welcome, John.","Turning to the business, we are pleased to report a good start to the year, with operating profit and earnings exceeding our expectations in the first quarter. Earlier pricing actions in Venezuela certainly gave our results a boost, but, even excluding Venezuela, our profit came in better than anticipated.","Net sales, excluding Venezuela, came in slightly below our expectations, but, even where we came up short, we can point to specific factors that we don't consider to be ongoing. For example, first, in U.S. Snacks, we underwent a major reorganization of our DSD sales force, changing thousands of employees' roles, managers, zones and customers. And this impacted our display activity in Q1 and into Q2, but it was the right thing to do. And when everyone settles into their new roles, we should see improved selling and merchandising effectiveness.","Second, in European Cereal, sales were soft in Q1. We think this is largely the consequence of timing of investment. Our innovation came in midway through the quarter, and we have our big events, such as tie-ins with Euro Soccer and Olympics, coming this summer.","And finally, in businesses like Eggo and MorningStar Farms, we made portfolio changes and product transitions that weighed down short-term results. Those should lead to better performance as the year goes on.","Like I said, these are all factors that should prove to be temporary, and we expect to see gradual improvement as the year progresses.","Q1 featured some very tangible signs of progress and clear evidence of sustainable improvement in results. Our U.S. Cereal business continued to gain share, reflecting the benefits of investing in our food and Kellogg sales reps. Our Big Three U.S. Cracker brands collectively grew sales, consumption and share. We generated growth in our Pringles brand in all four regions, reflecting our expansion of that brand's portfolio and presence around the world.","Our business in Asia grew currency-neutral comparable net sales at a high single-digit rate, reflecting our commitment to emerging markets. And our joint ventures, though not consolidated in our net sales results, also provided excellent emerging markets growth.","Meanwhile, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives, in conjunction with our underlying productivity initiatives, delivered strong efficiencies that contributed to a higher operating profit margin, so there's a lot to be encouraged about in Q1.","Let's talk briefly about where this leaves us for the full year. Ron will get into the specifics of our guidance in a moment, but here's how I would summarize our outlook on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our outlook for operating profit and earnings per share, excluding Venezuela, has not changed. We are on track. Including Venezuela, our outlook actually improves for sales, profit and earnings, owing to an earlier impact from inflationary pricing actions.","We'll see a little more of our net sales growth coming from Venezuela, due to the pricing, and a little less from the rest of the business, which we now believe will finish the year with 0% to 2% net sales growth, excluding Venezuela. But remember, as the short-term factors I mentioned earlier get behind us, we continue to expect to build momentum as we go through the year.","And with that, let me turn it to Ron for more details on the financials.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide four shows highlights of the financial results for the first quarter. First quarter currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 6.6%. Like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined by 1%.","First quarter currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 34.9%, also including the impact of Venezuela pricing. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of Venezuela, increased nearly 2% and exceeded our expectations.","Reported operating profit for the first quarter was $438 million, including the impact of mark-to-market accounting, Project K upfront costs and the currency remeasurement to the Venezuelan business. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in the appendices to this presentation.","Comparable earnings were $0.97 per share in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations due to operating profit performance. This included $0.36 of currency headwind, $0.34 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1.33 per share, which represented a year-over-year increase of 36% and which was above our original expectations.","It's worth noting that the currency remeasurement to the Venezuelan business occurred at the end of the second quarter 2015. So this large year-on-year impact from currencies will continue through the second quarter of this year.","Now, let's turn to the slide five and the drivers of the first quarter sales. Volume declined slightly in the quarter, including a few factors that are temporary, as John mentioned. These included a sales force transition in U.S. Snacks, trade inventory reductions in markets like Mexico and product calls and transitions in U.S. Frozen Foods. These factors masked good volume growth in our U.S. Specialty Channels, our Asian Cereal business and our International Snacks businesses, led by Pringles.","Price\/mix contributed 7.3% to sales growth, largely due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Price\/mix, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined slightly by 0.4%, largely a result of the difficult economic environment in Europe. And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by almost 12% in the quarter, with 10 points of that impact coming from Venezuela.","Slide six shows the currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter. Currency-neutral comparable gross margin increased by 210 basis points in the first quarter, including the impact of significant and earlier pricing actions to cover inflation in our Venezuela business. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our gross margin decreased by 20 basis points, reflecting the investments we're making in our food and packaging around the world, as well as some headwinds from transactional currencies.","We also experienced the impact of some category and channel mix in the quarter, but we should see this reverse a bit as our sales trends improve in certain categories and markets as the year progresses. We still expect that gross margin, excluding Venezuela, will improve for the full year as we experience positive contributions from Project K, our zero-based budgeting initiative and net deflation in input costs.","Slide seven shows the regional operating profit performance for the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit in North America increased by 8%. This was due to gross margin growth and lower SG&A, driven by Project K savings, the zero-based budgeting initiative and lower net input costs. In Europe, first quarter operating profit increased by 1%, building on difficult comparisons last year.","This year's performance was the result of the timing of brand investment to support commercial programs and innovation, which was partially offset by the lower impact of sales. We were also lapping difficult comparisons in Latin America, although operating profit increased by 329%, due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit decreased by 27%, due to the impact of lower volume driven by trade inventory reductions, as well as inflation we saw in cost of goods sold.","Asia Pacific's operating profit decreased by 6% in the quarter, and this included increased levels of investment in capabilities to support growth, as well as transactional currency impacts.","It's important to note that our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives remain on track. The North America business realized savings from zero-based budgeting in line with our plan. And our international regions are making good progress assessing their spending and developing their goals for late 2016 and beyond.","Slide eight details cash flow for the first quarter. Our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer completed during the quarter. This lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million, although it's important to note that we get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net cash impact of the tender will be around $95 million. Even with the impact of the bond tender, we are still on track to deliver the $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures that we targeted initially.","And finally, our board recently approved a 4% increase in the dividend, which will bring our payout ratio slightly above 50%, and we remain committed to returning cash to our shareowners.","Slide nine shows our low levels of core working capital as a percentage of net sales. And as you can see, we reached 5.6% in the first quarter. This improvement was again driven by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting our working capital over the last year. And importantly, we have plans to improve this metric further in the periods to come.","Now, let's turn to slide 10 and our full year earnings per share walk. As you can see, there is no change in our comparable earnings per share, which remains a range of $3.64 to $3.71. What has changed is our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share, which increases to $4.00 to $4.07 per share, a year-on-year growth rate of 13% to 15%. And this is because of the impact of earlier pricing actions in Venezuela.","In the slide, this is depicted in the walk from currency-neutral to comparable, with Venezuela's currency impact going to $0.30 per share from a previous estimate of $0.04 per share. Obviously, Venezuela is a volatile market, so this estimate could change, but as a reminder, our guidance for comparable earnings per share remains unchanged at $3.64 to $3.71.","Pre-tax upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million, or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, about half of which should be in cost of goods sold. And full year integration costs are still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share.","Slide 11 adds net sales and operating profit, showing everything on a currency-neutral comparable basis and giving you a sense of what our outlook looks like with and without Venezuela. On this basis, including Venezuela, our guidance for net sales and operating profit, just like our earnings per share, moves higher. Specifically, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth goes to 11% to 13% from our previous estimate of 4% to 6%. And currency-neutral comparable net sales growth goes to 4% to 6% from our previous estimate of 1% to 3%.","The makeup of our net sales outlook changes with more growth coming from Venezuela and a little less from the rest of the business. We are toning down our outlook outside Venezuela because of some of the first half factors that we've already mentioned, such as the sales force transition in Snacks, product transitions in Frozen Foods and market conditions in Europe and Latin America. The good news is that we still expect the business to build momentum throughout the year. But the result of a trimmed down first half sales growth estimate is that we now expect full year comparable sales growth, excluding Venezuela, to be more like 0% to 2% instead of 1% to 3%.","Looking into other assumptions, we continue to expect improved gross margin for the year. We expect that input costs will be net deflationary, and that savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting will contribute to the margin improvement. As was the case previously, our margin guidance excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven pricing increases there and volatility in the market.","Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come in cost of goods sold. Savings through zero-based budgeting are still expected to be roughly $100 million, spread between cost of goods sold, brand building and overhead.","Comparable interest expense should be in a range between $235 million and $245 million. Comparable tax rates should be between 27% and 28%. And we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016, so no changes here.","And we continue to expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion. Full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including the investments we're making in Pringles growth and Project K.","And remember, we said on the fourth quarter call, that our comparable earnings per share delivery would be spread relatively evenly across the quarters. This is changing, as we delivered slightly higher earnings per share in the first quarter than we anticipated, and this will likely come out in Q2, partially due to the timing of investments.","And now, I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail regarding the North America operating segments.","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","Thank you, Ron. Good morning, everyone. Slide (sic) 12 is one I showed you at CAGNY earlier this year. As I mentioned then, our priority in North America is to return the business to profitable growth. And there are three key drivers of this transformation. We will accelerate the momentum behind advantaged brands in Cereal, Snacks and Frozen. We will transform the Veggie business and unlock the full potential of the Kashi Company. And we will expand margins while investing to grow, driven by our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives. As you'll hear over the next few minutes, we're making progress in all of these areas. Some may take longer to achieve than others, but we are confident we're on the right track and that we'll see continued improvement.","Now, let's start with slide (sic) 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. Overall, we are pleased with the results in the first quarter, and we remain on track with our plan to return to growth in 2016. Our Core Six cereal brands, in combination, drove another quarter of share growth. Special K, Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes and Mini-Wheats all gained or maintained share in the quarter. And Special K led the way, with good performance resulting from our redesigned messaging, product renovation and innovation. And as you know, we recently launched new Special K Nourish in the U.S. It's early, but we're encouraged by the initial acceptance.","Our See You at Breakfast promotion in January and the Give a Child a Breakfast promotion in March both performed very well. We did see some volatility in consumption in the cereal category during the quarter and an impact from the timing of Easter at the end of the quarter. But if you look at more recent weeks' data, the category has picked up again and it's clearly better than it has been in recent years.","We have confidence that our business will continue to improve in the coming quarters. Our share performance reflects the actions we took last year, and we've got more activity planned for the remainder of the year. In Q2, this includes two new Raisin Brand granolas and a Pixar's Finding Dory-themed cereal and promotion timed to coincide with the launch of the movie here in June. We also have our Olympic-themed activity coming in Q3 that also coincides with the timing of our big Back to School promotion.","Turning to Pop-Tarts briefly, it's worth mentioning that the business posted a mid-single-digit increase in net sales and share gains in the quarter. As we look forward, we have great new products planned, including Orange Crush and A&W Root Beer flavors. We expect growth to continue for the full year.","In summary, the Morning Foods business has made significant progress and will continue to improve. We've identified the issues that we needed to address. We've taken action, and we've started to see the benefits. The work isn't over, but we're committed to continuing the progress we've made so far over the balance of 2016 and 2017.","Turning to U.S. Snacks and slide (sic) 14, our net sales decline in Q1 was a little more than we'd planned, really because of two factors. First, we reorganized our sales force, creating a more clearly defined roles for the selling, merchandising and support. This is going to drive more effective selling and merchandising, but we did see some disruption in our sales and display activity as we transitioned thousands of employees to new roles, zones and customers. This was most visible in Cookies and Crackers and it continued into the month of April, but will be behind us as we get through Q2.","Second, our Wholesome Snacks business continued to decline in Q1. As we've discussed previously, this business remains our biggest challenge in Snacks, and we're still up against lost distribution, particularly from some prior years' innovations that simply haven't stuck. As you know, it's absolutely critical to get the food and the brand positioning right in this category. The good news is that Rice Krispie Treats have been a strong performer and its share was up again in Q1. And that we have several on-trend innovations and renovations launching here in the back half for all of our big Wholesome Snacks brands, such as Special K Protein Trail Mix bars, a new Nutri-Grain Pumpkin Spice variety and a couple of Cocoa Krispie treats, one including M&Ms. These give us reason to believe we can stabilize this business as the year progresses.","Now in the meantime, let's not lose sight of what's working well in Snacks. Our Big Three brands in Crackers, Cheez-It, Town House and Club, together posted good growth in net sales, consumption and share, all led by accelerated base consumption in the quarter. This is where we have invested both in brand building and innovation, and it continues to pay off. We feel very good about our plans for the rest of the year in Crackers, including Cheez-It sandwich crackers and Club Snack Stacks launching mid-year.","We also feel very good about our Pringles business. In Q1, it posted growth in net sales and consumption. In fact, we saw double-digit consumption gains for our core range, aided by efforts to improve assortment on shelf and increased brand building support. We also had double-digit consumption growth in our on-the-go formats business. We have more brand investment and exciting promotional events coming, giving us confidence in an accelerating growth trend for this brand year-to-go.","While Cookies declined in Q1, it was probably the category most affected by our sales force reorganization. It was also held back by an investment plan that doesn't really get going until here in Q2. We are reinvesting in our core foods in the form of renovated products and packaging, new products and seasonal rotations. And importantly, we are returning to advertising behind Keebler after several years off air. So the plans are in place for a better performance ahead.","We've still got work to do on Snacks for sure, but we are starting to see signs of the return to growth we expected this year. Growth will accelerate in Crackers and Pringles, with more brand investment, a focus on assortment and formats and exciting innovation coming here in the back half.","We've got advertising coming on Cookies with the Keebler Elves returning. We'll get past this sales transition in Q2, and we've got much in the way of improved innovation that should start coming in Wholesome Snacks later in the year to turn that business as we go forward.","So now, let's turn to slide (sic) 15, and the highlights of the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted good mid-single-digit net sales growth in Q1, with net sales growth in all channels and a balance between price realization and volume growth. Leading the way was double-digit growth in the Convenience channel, which featured strong consumption and share growth in Cereal, Crackers, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts, and Salty Snacks.","Foodservice also recorded good sales growth, led by Cereal, Wholesome Snacks, Pop-Tarts, Cookies and Salty Snacks. We also saw distribution gains in Vending in various categories, and we had a strong Girl Scout Cookie season.","Slide (sic) 16 shows the North American Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales for the segment were down, but we're making good progress in each of the businesses. In Frozen Foods, our Eggo business was down because of last year's SKU rationalization and a shift in the timing of innovation this year to Q2 from Q1. But excluding the cold SKUs, Eggo grew consumption in Q1. Similarly, our MorningStar Farms business felt the impact of resetting the shelf with our new resealable packages. But where we have converted to the new packaging, we are seeing positive results, and this conversion is now largely behind us.","Frozen Foods will see better performance as we get past these colds and resets and as we see the benefits of advertising on Eggo and MorningStar Farms, a promotional tie-in with the movie Finding Dory and some great innovation launching right here in the month of May.","Last, our Kashi business posted lower sales year-on-year in Q1. We did see sequential improvement led by Cereal, where we maintained share overall and gained share in the Natural Food channel. In addition to our renovation efforts, we've got great new products rolling out soon, including new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals, new gluten-free crackers, and some great savory granola bars. In addition, we're introducing here in May the plant-based protein powders we showed you at CAGNY a couple of months ago. All of this means that we expect continued improvement as we progress through the year.","And finally, in Canada, we saw good performance by both Cereal and Snacks. Cereal posted gains in net sales consumption and share led by core brands and the continued recovery of Special K, which grew 6% and gained 40 basis points of share.","So let's turn to slide (sic) 17 and the summary. Hopefully, you have a sense for the progress we are making on our priorities. We're continuing to gain share in U.S. Cereal and our Core Six brands are performing well. Our core snacking brands, including our Big Three Crackers and Pringles, are gaining momentum. The Frozen Food business is poised to return to growth on the strength of innovation. Kashi performance continues to improve as we get the food right and new products arrive in the market. Significant savings from Project K and ZBB are driving strong gross margin and operating profit growth.","I'm confident we've taken the right actions across the region to invest, drive growth, and increase margins. So finally, I'd like to thank all the members of the North America team for their hard work. We're making great progress together.","Now, I'll turn it back to John.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul. Now, let's turn to slide (sic) 18 and our European business, where sales declined slightly in the quarter. However, we did see some pockets of growth, particularly in the Pringles and Wholesome Snack businesses. The Pringles business in the region posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. This was led by sustained momentum in key markets and expansion of Pringles Tortilla into new markets.","Pringles posted strong share performance in the region, with share gains most pronounced in the UK and Germany. The Wholesome Snacks business also posted high single-digit sales growth, led by continued good performance in the UK, in Russia and in the Mediterranean Middle Eastern region. We've launched some great food and the business has responded.","However, our Cereal sales remain soft, particularly in the UK and France. Much of this is due to the timing of investment. As I mentioned earlier, our innovation launched later in the quarter and we have promotions tied to the Euro Soccer Tournament and the Olympics planned for the summer.","Over the balance of the year, we're investing in our food. Specifically, we have new innovation including Ancient Legends and Special K Nourish, which is similar to the product that recently launched in the U.S. And we will continue to work on the underlying fundamentals, including focusing on increasing our distribution in alternate channels. We also have a plan that has more support in Q2 and the second half than in Q1.","We expect a slight increase in net sales in the coming quarters on sustained growth in Wholesome Snacks and sequential improvement in Cereal, as the brand building investment begins to pick up in support of innovation and the promotions. We also should see continued expansion of our Pringles business.","Slide (sic) 19 highlights the performance of our Latin American business in the first quarter. As was the case for much of last year, the impacts of pricing in inflationary Venezuela drove double-digit currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in the period. We continue to manage the Venezuelan business very carefully, navigating local supply and power outages. Despite this, we gained share in Venezuela in the quarter.","Excluding the Venezuelan business, sales in the region declined by 2% in the quarter, driven by Cereal and softness in two markets. In Mexico, where we compared against strong year-ago growth, we saw a reduction in trade inventories and the timing of promotional investment, and these factors pulled down our net sales. However, our consumption in Mexico increased, and we gained share across our Cereal and Snacks categories, driven by strong innovation and commercial activation.","In the Mercosul region, we felt the impact of economic softness and trade inventory reductions in Brazil, especially where we lapped difficult year-ago comparisons. The good news is that amidst this economic softness, we did increase our share of the Cereal category and Wholesome Snacks category in Brazil. And I'd also like to point out consumption and share gains in Colombia was better than our shipment performance in Latin America. We launched new products late last year and in Q1 of this year, which are contributing to the consumption performance. Specifically, the launch of Special K Protein, which I mentioned last quarter, has gone very well.","Meanwhile, the region's Snacks business continued to perform well, posting mid-single digit sales growth, with growth and expansion in markets like Mexico and the Andean and Mercosul regions. The Pringles brand grew at a mid-single digit rate, and we believe that we have considerable upside in this brand.","As we said on the Q4 call, the macroeconomic conditions in the region are challenging, but we've seen some good results in many parts of the region, especially in our in-market performance with the share gains I mentioned. So we remain on plan to improve results, ex-Venezuela, as the year progresses.","Let's look at slide (sic) 20 and our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable sales growth for the region was approximately 1%, although sales would have increased at a mid-single digit rate if the impact of the joint ventures in China and Africa were included.","In Asia, our sales increased at a high single digit rate, with strong growth in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia and Japan.","We reinvested in the Pringles business and launched new products, both of which helped to drive mid-single digit sales growth for the brand in the quarter. In Australia, sales declined in Q1, although we saw sequential improvement and year-to-date through April, we've gained share in the Cereal category. We also have innovation planed for introduction in Australia beginning in the second quarter. This, in combination with new support, should contribute to the improving trend that we've started to see.","In summary, our plans for the overall business are exciting, and we expect improving performance over the remainder of the year.","So let's turn to the summary on slide (sic) 21. On last quarter's earnings call, I mentioned four reasons to believe that we are building momentum in 2016. First, we are investing in our food and packaging. We saw this in Q1, with cereals like Special K Nourish driving improved performance in the U.S. and Canada. We rolled out GMO-free Kashi products in the U.S. and new resealable packaging in MorningStar Farms. In Europe, we saw good success in new granola and muesli offerings, and we'll see more consumer-driven renovation and innovation as we go through the year.","Second, we are expanding Pringles. This could be seen during Q1 with our growth across every region. This will continue to be an avenue of growth for us in the future.","Third, we are enhancing our sales capabilities. We took action in Q1, as evidenced by our reorganization in U.S. Snacks, the continued progress of additional feet on the street in Morning Foods and expanding our presence in high-frequency stores in Latin America and Asia. Winning where the shopper shops is a key strategic pillar for us and we should see even more benefit from these capability investments as the year progresses.","And finally, increasing our earnings visibility by our Project K and ZBB; this helped drive profitability already in Q1. And behind the scenes, these initiatives are creating a cost discipline and spending behavior that can yield more savings and more earnings visibility going forward.","So I'm happy to report that we are on track on all of these. I've also stated that we should see steady improvement in our performance as the year progresses. The plan is designed that way, with bigger reinvestments ahead, savings developing as the year progresses and some hurdles coming early in the year and giving way to better performance later. In short, we expect momentum to build through the year.","And now, I'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Dave Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, two questions. Good morning. Paul, could you go into what exactly were those sales structure changes and how do those relate to the investments in feet in the street that Kellogg's has made in recent years? Thanks.","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","Okay. So specifically, regarding the changes in Snacks, the change was designed to separate sales and merchandising functions within the sales force to enable better focus and execution between selling up and merchandising. It's as simple as that. It does come on top of previous investments we've made in our DSD, specifically sales force, in terms of technology, which obviously will unlock some of the benefits of the technology as we do this as well.","So, it's separate from anything we've done in Morning Foods and feet on the street, but it is a continuation of us building more effective and efficient working practices within our DSD sales organization.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And do you think that there's just a learning curve that needs to happen for the merchandising to come? Is that what happens?","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","Obviously, any disruptive change is disruptive. And so when you touch as many sales people, merchandisers in the context of customers, there is some disruption. So, many people find themselves in new roles calling on new stores. And so we anticipated that. We've seen a bit more on the incremental side in terms of display, especially on Cookies and Crackers, but we're largely through that now as we come into the month of May. And so, we expect things to pick up from here.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, just circling back on U.S. Cereal and, for that matter, overall U.S. Packaged Food, even if you exclude Easter noise and look through the latest period year-to-date, it looks like the overall growth rate in the industry is just less than what it was last year. Have you seen any good reasons for this? And do you think you can drive revenue improvement even with the type of growth that we saw in the first four months or so?","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","It's interesting. I meet with a lot of customers. I haven't met a customer yet who doesn't want to engage with big brands to drive growth. So, I think our focus across all our categories is very much on building winning plans for our customers. The bigger the idea, the better you execute it, the more impact you'll have in-store. I think specifically to Kellogg, there's a little bit of timing in the Cereal business, where we were very strong last year in March, April because of The Avengers promotion. Our big idea this year is the Finding Dory movie, which launches in June. So there's a little bit of timing in there, but we feel very good about the quality of our plans, our brand communication and our innovation ideas as they come to market here.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","I know you talked about the DSD changes and some of the disruptions there. How much of an effect did that have on margins and how much of that is temporary?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In the quarter, in terms of gross margins, or operating margins?","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, on the operating margin.","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","If you've seen the reported data, the Snacks business did pretty well on operating profit through the first quarter, so there's no real near-term impact on margins. There was some sales disruption, as I said, when it comes to our performance on display at the top line. Now, we're hopefully through that and we move forward. We expect this to be a more effective and more efficient way of operating going forward.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","It sounds like some of the transformation you made, it doesn't add any fixed costs or I'm just trying to get a sense of, even with the performance in the quarter, if there's a different trajectory for how that business looks?","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","No, there's no cost addition to this at all. In fact, it'll be more efficient and effective going forward.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, nice. Thanks. And then just one other on Kashi, could you give a little better sense of some of the moving parts there? I know you've still got some innovation and marketing efforts there to turn that business around. What's the latest update in a little bit more detail?","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","If you look at the Kashi business over the past 18 months or so now, or at least 15 months, we continue to see sequential improvement in the performance of the business. As you are aware, we put the team back in California just over a year ago. We're seeing especially our Cereal business perform a lot better. Share was flat in the first quarter. We're actually growing the business now in the Natural channel, and the team's been really working hard at building a pipeline of ideas to get back ahead in terms of a food-focused, mission-based operation.","So we have new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals launching here now. We have savory granola bars launching at the end of the second quarter. We have some culturally-inspired crackers that I've spoke about before. We have granola bites coming from Bear Naked at the turn of the quarter as well in the third quarter. And we have a brand new range \u2013 which is shipping now \u2013 of Kashi GOLEAN and Kashi branded protein powders to lean into new segments with the brand. Of note, our Bear Naked Granola business is growing at a good mid-single to high single-digit click. So the Granola business in Bear Naked does well.","One more part of the Kashi Company is Stretch Island Fruit Snacks, a very small business we don't talk a lot about, but that's growing at a strong double-digit rate as well. And we've reinvented that food, made it all organic, invested back in the food there as well. So there's been a lot of reinvestment in food to renovate and now a lot of innovation about to come, which gives us the confidence we're going to get this business back to growth over the coming months in 2016 and into 2017.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. I guess I'll focus my question on European Cereal, because the declines you're experiencing now seem to be on top of declines a year ago and maybe even a year after that. And, John, you've made management changes in Europe. You've tried introducing some innovation along the way. If you had to do like a root cause analysis as to what's happening there, why hasn't it stabilized like the U.S. has? And what should give us confidence that the new innovation you're talking about for second quarter \u2013 why is that going to stabilize the business? Maybe start there for me.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Rob. I think if you come back and look at the U.S. business over the last couple of years, we said there are two big brands in the U.S. that we needed to fix. One was Special K. One was Kashi. In both cases, where we've put on-trend food in the marketplace, we've seen consumers respond to that very positively. And you've seen those results come through in the U.S. results last year and into this year. Same is true in Canada. And, as I said in the prepared remarks, in Australia, we're also seeing significantly improved results through first quarter on the back of improved food that's more on-trend with what consumers are looking for.","The same will be true in the UK. So we have four large cereal markets, U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK. The UK is the last one for us to turn, but we believe, again, putting the right food in the marketplace for consumers is going to make the difference. The Ancient Legends food that we had at Day at K is more of a granola, great taste, visible nutrition-type food, as is the Special K Nourish food that's being an important part of the Special K turnaround in the U.S. and the Special K Red Berries renovation in the U.S. we'll also have going into the UK market as well. A lot of those food changes, though, got cut into the shelf in the later part of Q1. So we do expect to see the business respond to that.","I don't necessarily expect to see the European Cereal business get back to growth in this year, but, in many respects, that Cereal weakness in Europe is masking some very strong growth in other parts of the European business. So when you have Pringles up high single digits and Wholesome Snacks up high single digits, we clearly have the ability to execute if we have great food in the marketplace. We have great food behind Cereal. I have confidence we'll see our European top line trends improve as we go through this year.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Can I ask a follow-up on Wholesome Snacks? You talked about some innovation that's coming, but I think you mentioned Cocoa Krispies with M&Ms. Can you give us some examples of some wholesome snacks that are a little more wholesome that are coming in the back half? I think you said Special K Trail Mix. There's a lot of trail mix items out there. Is there anything really innovative coming?","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","Rob, it's Paul. Obviously, turning around Wholesome, as we said, is going to take a bit of time. And it does mean a focus on food and a focus on core brands. So Rice Krispie Treats is a great brand that plays in a certain segment within Wholesome Snacks and has been doing very well and it's a question of fueling its growth, so those things fit.","When you come across to Nutri-Grain, looking forward on Nutri-Grain, it's really reinvesting in the core soft-bake bars. And we have two initiatives coming: one, a pumpkin spice initiative; another one with chocolate and raspberry, which is very close in to what Nutri-Grain stands for.","Beyond that, as you lean towards the healthier, if you like, perceived elements of Wholesome Snacks, we've already renovated many of our base Special K bars. And since those renovations there are doing better; we are now bringing protein trail mix bars to Special K.","And then the one or two brands that really I think need to step up and step in here to broaden out our portfolio and our growth are actually coming from Kashi and Bear Naked because they have really been absent over the last two, three years. And therefore, we're renovating our core Kashi granola bars. We're bringing new to the world savory bars on Kashi. We're bringing new granola bites from Bear Naked as we go into the end of the second quarter here. And you'll see more innovation coming on bars from Kashi and Bear Naked in that, what I would call, lifestyle performance area of Wholesome Snacks. So you have to look at the whole picture to think about how we innovate and renovate across every segment. Again, the turn's not going to come overnight, but we've spent a lot of time with a lot of customers talking about our view for the future, and there's a lot of encouragement coming about how our portfolio can play to win as we look forward.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. You talked about Special K Cereal doing well. At least in the Nielsen numbers, and I know it doesn't tell the whole story, the brand seems to have trailed off a little bit in recent months. And now takeaway is trending somewhat negatively again. I don't know if that's truly reflecting what you're seeing, but if it is, we're also seeing Kashi still doing much better, but still negative year-on-year, too. So, I guess the question is, what needs to happen in terms of innovation or marketing for these brands to sustainably grow \u2013 very positive takeaway year-on-year \u2013 so that we really don't talk about them as sort of restoration project anymore?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure the data you're looking at, Ken. I mean, Special K was up about 3% and gained 30 basis points of share. The Red Berries initiative, that part of the portfolio was still growing at north of 5%, so the brand is growing. There may be some timing of activity year-on-year where we launched Red Berries so you may be something in the near-in data that might look strange, but the underlying trends, as we see them \u2013 and now with Nourish just gearing up \u2013 we have some great seasonal items coming in Q3 as well on Special K. We think the brand is back on its stride. I mean, I don't think it's going to be growing double digit year-in, year-out, but it should be a contributor to growth across our core portfolio going forward, so we feel good that we've got it growing.","I mentioned in Canada, where we've done something similar, the Canadian business is ticking up as well. And so when we think Core Six brands and growing across our major customers, K's a huge component part of that. And so, we're happy with the progress we've made.","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","Maybe just to comment at a macro level, I think when the category was soft, and this is true for all of the large markets, it really had to do with some of the adult brands not doing well. And now the adult brands are doing much better, with Kashi coming back, with Special K, even a brand like Raisin Bran doing a lot better. And bringing adults back into the category and driving adult consumption, I think is what happened across the 2000. It helped drive the category then, and that's our focus as we drive forward here.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe I'll follow up offline about the Special K stuff. But, John, one follow-up from me, you made some comments at the end of your prepared remarks about some ZBB. It sounded to me as though maybe you're sensing some upside, possibly not this year but down the road, to the guidance of $100 million. Is that the right way to think about it or is it just too early to be confident in the out-year outlook here?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Ken, it's Ron. We're confident in the $100 million. There is no doubt about that. So we're still on track within North America to deliver against that. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, our international regions would start progressing their zero-based budgeting initiatives early in the year. They have done so. They're identifying targets, assessing the discretionary spend across similar categories as to what we did in North America. That is progressing extremely well. We do expect to see a little bit of savings from the international regions in 2016, but most of that will come into 2017. North America, by the way, also in the first quarter, was on plan. We had embedded the zero-based budget savings into their plan, and they were on or slightly above plan, frankly. So we're in good shape on the program.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And just on zero-based budgeting, it both delivers savings but also provides a great tool and mechanism just to challenge historical assumptions and to challenge in maybe some areas where some investment was happening that were not getting the return and move it to areas that we are getting good return. So it's not always just the savings that comes out of it so much as the underlying methodology and driving and pushing on key assumptions.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You mentioned negative category and channel mix just that caused some headwinds to gross margin this quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit on that as well? And just as a follow-up, the Cereal category seemed to be getting into some more stable position a few months ago and now, it seems to have slumped back again. How close are you getting to retailers talking about shrinking the size of the category? What are your distribution and shelf space trends at the moment? And what's the outlook there? Thank you.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, Alexia, first on the category and channel mix, so across the business, we're seeing a little bit more adverse mix as a result of some of our big developed Cereal markets and the trends in those businesses and, as Paul mentioned, the transition that we're doing in U.S. Snacks, very profitable business for us both from a gross margin standpoint and profitability standpoint. So as they go through that transition, sales were down a little bit more than we had expected. That had an adverse impact on our mix. And as we're growing in some of our emerging markets, we're seeing a little bit adverse impact in mix. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect this to improve as we progress through the course of the year and we build momentum on our sales outlook.","Paul T. Norman - Senior Vice President & President, Kellogg North America, Kellogg Co.","Alexia, Paul. On the question about space in-store and retailers, we're not seeing anything at a macro level, but different retailers obviously have different strategies as to how they manage the category. So we have seen in instances, for example, number of sizes reduced in certain retailers, but we've also seen an increase in space for natural and organic, which has benefited, obviously, brands like Kashi for us.","So I think it really is a quest of always looking to maximize assortment. And we spend a lot of our time trying to maximize assortment holding power behind the fastest moving biggest items. So to me, it's very much a question about sales fundamentals and back to this notion of customers want big brands to grow. We need bigger, better ideas to help them grow. And so nothing at a macro level, but every retailer is different in terms of their strategy.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. And, Simon, we'll miss you and looking forward, John, to working with you going forward.","Simon D. Burton, CFA - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Alexia.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Two questions for me, just like little ones and then kind of a bigger one for you, John. Just the little questions are can you give us some sense of the cost savings pacing throughout 2016? And then, on Latin America, I think we begin to lap some of the big currency devaluations in the second half of the year. What kind of growth do you expect in profits after you lap all of that currency issue in LatAm?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so, first, in terms of their cost savings that we're seeing, zero-based budgeting and Project K as well, it's spread relatively evenly over the course of the year. So we saw savings within the first quarter and we'll see savings as we progress through the year as well.","In terms of Venezuela, as I mentioned, we did this remeasurement at the middle of 2015. So we'll be past that after the second quarter. We do expect our sales trends to improve. And as those sales trends improve, that will improve our profitability performance. Remember, we've guided 4% to 6% operating profit growth on our ex-Venezuela business. We delivered 2% in the first quarter. So as you'd expect, we'll see more growth going through the balance of the year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, John, for \u2013 go ahead, John.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry. I was going to turn to your Latin American question there for a second and margins in Latin America. As you look across the company, you can see us investing back in the emerging markets. So Asia Pacific and Latin America, we're not looking for as much, say, margin expansion as we are from North America and Europe. Within Latin America, within 2016, it's fair to say that we're seeing a little bit more economic softness and a little bit more challenges in the southern part of Latin America than what we would've liked to have seen. We do expect to see operating profit growth on a comparable basis, ex-Venezuela, in the region, but probably more low single digits and sales growth in the same sort of range, again, ex-Venezuela just reflecting the difficulty in the marketplace.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That makes sense. Big picture, John, last night, one of your major competitors reported. They show up with an operating margin at 27%. It was up 700 basis points year-over-year. You guys are running just over 15% on your operating margin. Can you just kind of frame up for us like what's the long-term opportunity at Kellogg? I mean, are we right to think that there really is a substantial operating margin improvements opportunity at Kellogg? And just love to hear your perspective on what's happening in this industry right now.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, David, as we discussed at Day at K and at CAGNY, we are committed to expanding our operating margins over time. We've set a goal of 17% to 18% operating margin by 2020. Clearly, we look very closely at what other companies are doing, our peer group and our competitors. One of the core values of the Kellogg Company is that we have the humility and hunger to learn. And we will look very closely at what's happening at Kraft Heinz and all the other companies in the industry. And if we see opportunities to improve the economics of our business and to drive shareholder value creation, we'll certainly pursue those.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you so much.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Simon D. Burton, CFA - Vice President-Investor Relations","Gary, this is Simon. I think we've got time for one last question, please.","Operator","The final question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Actually just one question on phasing, Ron, I think you said earlier that there may be a little bit of giveback in 2Q, on the second quarter. So in terms of, I think when we started the year, we talked about the EPS being pretty much the same each quarter through the year. You over-delivered a little bit in the first quarter and maybe that giveback would be in 2Q. So could you just elaborate a little bit more? Did I hear that correctly? And, if so, is that still we've got some of the sales drag that kind of leaks from 1Q into 2Q? And I don't know if maybe there are some other expenses or other items that would just affect 2Q specifically versus the balance of the year?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. Bryan, you're thinking about it correctly. When we started the year, on the fourth quarter call, I said expect our comparable earnings per share, and that includes the impact to currency, to be spread relatively evenly across the four quarters of the year. We did deliver a little bit more in the first quarter. And we said that might come out of the second quarter. And some of that is related to the timing of investments and activations that we're doing against our commercial programs and our renovations as we move into the second quarter. So expect the second quarter to be a little bit lower than the average of the four quarters now.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Bryant for any closing remarks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you all for your questions and interest in the Kellogg Company. At this time, I'd like to share with you the news that Ron Dissinger, our Chief Financial Officer for the past seven years, has decided to retire after 30 great years with the company. Ron has been a key member of our leadership team, combining a strong business acumen with a disciplined approach to finance. And I'm sure you all have enjoyed working with Ron as much as I have.","It may not surprise you that Ron will be retiring in a very careful, deliberate way. He will remain the company's CFO through the end of 2016. This will give us proper time to do a thorough search, both internally and externally, for his successor. Ron will also stay on into 2017 to ensure an orderly and effective transition, so we'll have good continuity.

Mr. Burton, you may begin, sir.","Simon D.

I'm joined here by John Bryant, CEO and Chairman; and by Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer.","The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. And as you're aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements.

The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","And now, I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are pleased to have reported results that have met our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2015. We saw good growth in both currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit and the individual performances of many of our businesses were strong, with currency neutral comparable sales growth in U.S. Cereal, U.S. Specialty Channels, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. We continue to build momentum and trends continue to improve. And importantly, as you've seen in the public data, our consumption increased in the U.S. Cereal business in the fourth quarter and we gained share. Obviously, this continued momentum had a positive impact on overall results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.","The broad-based quarterly performance led to the underlying full-year currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit results that were in line with our expectation. 2015's performance represented an improvement from 2014's results and we're continuing to build momentum in 2016.","Comparable currency neutral earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range, and full year cash flow of $1.1 billion was also in line with our recently increased estimates and we have excellent earnings visibility as we continue to make great progress executing Project K and implementing zero-based budgeting. So we met or exceeded our targets for 2015, and the performance we achieved set a great base for growth and the momentum we've built provides us with confidence as we enter the year.","So now let's turn to slide four and more detail on our expectations for 2016. The momentum we built in 2015 was the result of better innovation, better support, better execution, and some of the visibility provided by our cost savings programs. And we expect this level of execution and the momentum to continue in 2016. Specifically, we're very pleased with the momentum that we built in the U.S. Cereal business. We ended the year with fourth quarter consumption growth of more than 2% for the Kellogg brand and a share gain of 70 basis points, and results in December were even better. I'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.","The Project K and zero-based budgeting programs will each generate $100 million in savings in 2016. That's $200 million in total flexibility that we'll use to continue to drive top-line growth and increase margins.","Importantly, as you heard at the Investor Day a couple of months ago, we're excited about the plans we have to drive growth in North America and in each of the international regions, and we will remain focused on executing those plans throughout 2016.","We're investing in the top-line by improving our food, by introducing great new innovation across categories and businesses, by increasing the geographic expansion of Pringles, by improving sales capabilities, and by focusing on other activities designed to help us win where the shopper shops.","So we're pleased that all this has put us back on our long-term growth algorithm in 2016. Specifically, we still expect low-single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit operating profit growth and earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, all on a currency neutral comparable basis. Ron will discuss this in a minute. We're excited about our plans across all the areas of our business and are very encouraged by the impact our actions are making.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide five shows financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%. This was ahead of our expectations and included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. We also saw improving trends and sales growth in our business, excluding the impact of Venezuela. We always had anticipated approximately 1 point of sales growth benefit from Venezuela in our guidance for the full year. The accelerated pricing drove an additional point and resulted in full year sales growth of 1.2%.","Currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter. This included a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation of 4%. So growth in operating profit in the fourth quarter would have been approximately 7% excluding the rebasing of incentive comp.","Full year currency neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 2.3%, at the high end of our guidance range of between down 2% to 4%. Full year operating profit would have also increased by approximately 1%, excluding the impact of rebasing incentive comp.","Reported operating profit for the full year was $1.1 billion and for the quarter was a loss of $39 million, including a non-cash mark-to-market charge for pensions of $393 million. This was primarily driven by the impact that asset returns had on our pension plans, but it is worth noting that even at historically low discount rates, our pension plans are almost 90% funded. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in the Appendices to the presentation.","Comparable earnings were $0.79 per share in the quarter, and these results include $0.06 of currency headwind. Currency neutral comparable earnings were $0.85 per share for the quarter, an increase of 1.2%. Full year comparable earnings were $3.53 per share including $0.28 of impact from currencies. So as a result, full year currency neutral comparable earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and flat to last year.","Slide six shows the components of the full year and quarterly sales growth. Overall, currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2% for the full year. We delivered double-digit growth in Asia and strong growth in Latin America. Pringles also delivered another strong year of growth across the globe, and our U.S. Cereal business continues to see improving trends and posted good growth in the fourth quarter.","Price\/mix increased by 1.9% as a result of growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by the impact of Venezuela. We also saw price\/mix improvement in several North America businesses and in European Snacks.","While volume declined for the year, driven by developed Cereal and U.S. Snacks, we saw good growth in the global Pringles business and in the emerging market Cereal business. And as you can see on the chart, the impact of 2014's 53rd week reduced reported sales growth by 1.3% and the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 7.5%, more than half of which was due to the mid-year re-measurement in Venezuela.","As a reminder, our joint ventures in China and Africa aren't included in these numbers; however, we saw very good rates of growth from them in the fourth quarter.","Slide seven shows details regarding our fourth quarter and full year currency neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Comparable gross margin for the full year was down slightly and in line with our expectations. It is important to note that gross margin for the quarter and the full year has been impacted by accelerating levels of inflation in Venezuela. Of course, we were able to price to manage the profit of the business to our plan, but gross margin deteriorated. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, gross margin increased by 20 basis points for the full year and by 30 basis points for the fourth quarter.","Slide eight shows the fourth quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 3%. This was due to gross margin expansion resulting from lower input costs and savings from the Project K initiative in the region. This is partially offset by the impact of rebasing incentive compensation, which lowered North America's operating profit growth by more than 5% in the quarter.","We're pleased with the full year operating profit growth of 4% in Europe. Results for the fourth quarter were due to the timing of investment in brand building and some discrete costs. Without these discrete costs, operating profit would have increased by approximately 5%.","Operating profit in Latin America increased by 46%, due to the impact of Venezuela on the region's results. In addition, we saw good results in Mexico, good overhead management, and a favorable impact from the timing of investment.","Operating profit decreased by 13% in the Asia Pacific region. We do continue to invest in sales growth in Cereal and Snacks in this region. This includes investment in our brands and our people. In addition, we saw higher cost of goods in the quarter due to the timing of spend across the year.","Slide nine shows our full year cash flow. Full year operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $1.1 billion, $100 million higher than our estimate as we began 2015. We're very pleased with this result as it includes the cash required for Project K of approximately $330 million. We offset this use of cash with the excellent execution of our payables initiative. And importantly, in 2015 we returned more than $1.4 billion to share owners through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 10 shows our industry leading core working capital as a percentage of net sales, and the improvement we've made over the last year. You can see that we ended the year with rolling 12-month core working capital as a percentage of sales of 6.2%. The significant year-over-year improvement is the result of excellent work that we've done on our payables initiative and we'll continue our efforts to free up cash from our balance sheet as we proceed through 2016.","Slide 11 shows our currency neutral comparable guidance for the full year 2016, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will increase at a rate between 1% and 3%. Now while our original guidance always included approximately 1% of sales growth from the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation in the country. Obviously, this is hard to predict, but it is possible that full year comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to these changes in Venezuela. It's worth noting that even excluding the total impact of Venezuela, we still expect to be in our original guidance range of between 1% and 3%.","We anticipate deflation in cost of goods sold driven by material costs, in combination with savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting, we expect improved gross margin. Of course, this excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven volatility. Our material input costs are approximately 70% covered at this time.","Operating profit is still expected to grow at between 4% and 6% and we also still expect that currency neutral comparable earnings per share will increase between 6% and 8%.","Our outlook includes a higher tax rate due to comparisons in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense. Specifically, we expect interest expense to be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, reflecting an anticipated increase in rates and slightly higher levels of debt. The comparable tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28%.","Our board has approved a share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which will run through 2017 and we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016.","As always, our expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. We expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion. This includes our expectation that full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales to support growth in our Pringles business and Project K.","Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. We currently expect that currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.10 per share in 2016. This includes approximately $0.04 for the translation of Venezuela results impacting the first half 2016. We expect that integration costs from the transactions we did in Egypt and Nigeria in 2015 will be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share for the full year and we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come through cost of goods.","We estimate that pre-tax P&L costs for Project K and our zero-based budgeting implementation will be between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Approximately half of this will be in cost of goods and it's important to note that both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiative remain on track.","Finally, our currency headwind is much more significant in the first quarter and the first half of the year and the increases in tax and interest expense also impact Q1 in the first half of the year. So a simple way to think about our comparable earnings per share delivery, including currency, is that it will be delivered relatively evenly across the year.","And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail regarding the operating segments.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw goods results from the business in the fourth quarter, with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U.S. Cereal business.","As you can see on the chart, we gained share in 2015 and in the fourth quarter, and had a great ending to the year in December. As you saw last quarter, our base sales performance was even better, with growth all year and growth of 4% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, our Core Six brands led this growth: Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes, Mini-Wheats and Special K all saw consumption growth in the quarter with Special K posting high-single-digit growth. This was driven primarily by changes to messaging and the renovation work we did last year on Red Berries and the good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran s the result of the introduction of Raisin Bran with cranberries, which showed good results for the entire franchise.","So we saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals. We improved our brand building and the new products we launched; we invested in our foods; we put fun back in the box with Avengers and Disney Frozen-themed Cereals and we've quickly taken these learnings to other regions of the world, as I'll discuss in a minute.","I'd like to thank Paul Norman, who began this transformation, and Craig Bahner, who has continued it, and the entire Morning Foods team. The hard work is having significant impact. And we're optimistic about this business as we enter 2016. We said last year that we would improve the performance of Special K, and we have, as you can see on the graph on the slide. And we're going to continue to drive sales in 2016 with the introduction much new products like Special K Nourish, which you can also see pictured on the slide. Special K Nourish is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see and the food includes fruits, nuts and on trend grains like quinoa. It's early but the initial response has been encouraging and we will continue to focus on all our Core Six brands, as Craig discussed at the Investor Day in November.","We have a range of new products launching in 2016. Some are on-trend foods such as Special K Nourish and Harvest Delights Mini-Wheats, and some are fun additions, including S'mores, Disney Dory-themed Cereal and Orange Crushed Pop-Tarts.","So we saw improvement throughout 2015. The Cereal business continued to improve as the year progressed, and we saw the results of the investments and changes we made. We're excited about the plans we have for 2016, and expect continued improvement.","Let's turn to slide 15 and our U.S. Snacks business. We again saw sequential improvement in consumption in the cookie, cracker, Wholesome Snack and Pringles businesses in the quarter. We gained distribution in the overall cracker category as a result of innovation and Cheez-It continued to post good consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as it has all year. This was driven by contributions from new products, including Cheez-It Extra Toasty and Grooves. And as Deanie Elsner said at Day of K, we will increase our focus and our investment on core brands in 2016, including Cheez-It.","We restaged Special K cracker chips during the year and we saw improved consumption performance as the year progressed due to renovations we made to the packaging and the food. We did see continued declines in consumption of popcorn chips in the fourth quarter, which had an impact on results. However, we expect the impact of the remaining SKUs to lessen as we progress through 2016.","We also gained distribution in the cookie business in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in consumption I mentioned continued the trend we saw last quarter and was driven by Chips Deluxe, Fudge Shoppe and Famous Amos. These brands benefited from expanded distribution, new products, and increased in-store activity. We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016 and we're also going to give the brands new support, including the relaunch of advertising, featuring the Keebler Elves.","We continue to see very good rates of consumption growth in Rice Krispies Treats in the Wholesome Snack category in the fourth quarter. In addition, the performance of our Special K bars has improved due to new products and renovation, especially our new Special K Chewy Nut Bars.","The overall Pringles business posted good underlying growth in the Grocery and Convenience channels. We continue to expand our global capacity and we have good plans across all our customers in 2016. As a result, we expect this business to post strong rates of growth for the year.","We are making progress in the Snacks business. We are increasing investment and focusing it on our largest brands. We're making sure that we have the right offerings in the right channels and we're expanding our offerings in the On-The-Go segment. And as in all of the North American region, we're using the flexibility we have to fund these changes and drive improving profitability. Deanie and the whole team are making a real difference and we expect modest sales growth in the business in 2016 with sequential improvement across the year.","So let's turn to slide 16 and highlights from the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels business increased in the quarter. We saw growth in the Vending and Convenience Channels with net sales in the Convenience channel increasing at a high-single-digit rate. We saw strong growth in Rice Krispies Treats in the Vending Channel and from Cheez-It and Pringles in the Convenience channel. And we gained or maintained share in the Cereal, cracker, Wholesome Snack and salty snack categories within the channel for the full year. We also gained share in the Foodservice channel in the cereal, cracker and cookie categories in the fourth quarter. The Specialty business also built a solid base in 2015, and our expectations are the team will drive good results in 2016.","Slide 17 shows the North America Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. The Frozen Foods business saw continued growth from Eggo hand-held sandwiches in the quarter. Consumption increased at a double-digit rate as it did all year. Overall sales declined at a low-single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by the impact of egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity, and the drawing down of inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags. This veggie food packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year.","We saw continued sequential improvement in the Kashi business in the fourth quarter, and the performance improved within the quarter. The Cereal business improved due to the stabilization of distribution and the impact of an introduction of a new product in the second half of 2015, and the Bare Naked Granola brand posted double-digit consumption growth in the quarter.","The overall Kashi business, the overall Kashi business sales were down at a low-single-digit rate in the quarter. However, we expect continued improvement in 2016, due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a new focus on new products high in plant protein.","The Canadian business posted sales growth in the Cereal and Wholesome Snack businesses in the quarter. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and programs, much like the rest of North American region. But we'll continue to see an adverse impact from transactional foreign exchange.","Let's turn to slide 18 and our European business. Sales growth across the region was 1.6% in the quarter, with strong growth in the emerging markets. The Pringles business also posted double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both the UK and Germany in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Germany's performance were due to the introduction of Tortilla Pringles, and the strong results we saw in the UK were due to some great activity, including a successful Halloween themed promotion.","As you might imagine, we have some exciting activity planned for Pringles in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity, planned to coincide with the EURO soccer tournament in the summer and the continued rollout of Tortilla Pringles in the region.","The Wholesome Snack business also posted sales growth in the fourth quarter. This was due to better results in the UK, driven in part by Disney-branded Snacks, Mini Biscuits, Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies Squares. In addition, the Russian business did well, and we have new foods coming out across the region in 2016.","The Cereal business in Europe declined in the fourth quarter, due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K and Crunchy Nut in the UK, saw good performance from Extra in Italy and invested behind Kellogg's branded granola in Germany. And we recently launched the Ancient Legends brand in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like spelt, apples, sultanas and chia seeds.","And we're also applying earnings from other parts of the world, including the renovation of Special K Red Berries, the launch of Special K Nourish and we're also adding more fun in the box. So, the fourth quarter was a successful one for the European business, and we expect improvement to continue in 2016, as we launch great new products, invest for growth and continue to focus on execution.","Slide 19 shows highlights from our Latin America business in the fourth quarter. Total currency neutral comparable net sales again increased at a double-digit rate, primarily due to the impact of Venezuela. We saw sales growth in Mexico of approximately 4%, driven by great performance in the Cereal business. We gained share in the Cereal category in the latest public data and we saw improved performance from our adult-oriented cereals. We also gained share in Brazil in the quarter and for the year. These gains were partially the result of parent brand innovation and support. We launched Ancient Grains in Brazil in Q4, and in the first quarter of 2016 in the Andean region, and we also have Special K Protein and granola with quinoa planned for introduction.","Sales in the region's Snack business also increased in the quarter. This growth resulted from better execution, good innovation, and strength in the Pringles business. In fact, the Pringles business grew at a double-digit rate. Commercial innovation, strong execution, and promotional programs drove growth, and we expect continued good performance from the brand in 2016. And our focus on high frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in Convenience and Mini Super Stores in Mexico, and in smaller mom and pop stores in Columbia and we've also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.","We also had a good year in the Latin American business in 2015, despite challenging conditions driven by slowing economies and weakening currencies. The team has done a great job managing through these situations and we expect continued good performance in 2016.","Let's turn to slide 20 and our Asia Pacific business. Overall, currency neutral comparable sales growth was 3.3% in the fourth quarter, although this does not include the impact of the JVs in China and West Africa. If we include the impact of those businesses, we would have seen double-digit sales growth.","The Asian business posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales growth in Japan driven by the continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging. We also saw double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia.","The Pringles business in Asia Pacific grew volume at a double-digit rate. We saw broad-based sales growth and share gains through the innovation and gains in distribution. And the sub-Saharan African business also posted double digit, currency neutral comparable sales growth. We saw better execution and the benefit from the introduction of new products. And as I mentioned, the JV in West Africa also posted very strong growth.","The environment in Australia remained challenging with category sales continuing to decline. However, the granola and mueslis segments are going well and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We're also applying lessons learned from other parts of the business to Australia as we are in Europe.","We were pleased with the performance of the Asia Pacific region last year. For the full year, the region posted mid-single digit currency neutral comparable sales growth, and including the impact of the JVs, we would have achieved even higher growth. The Asian business continues to perform very well and while we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we do expect another good year from this business. We have plans in place and our execution remains strong.","Let's turn to Page 21 and the summary. Our results in the fourth quarter were in line with or ahead of our expectations. We saw good performance in net sales, operating profit, EPS and cash flow. We built a strong base and generated momentum in 2015. We told you we needed to improve the performance of the U.S. Cereal business and we have. We saw increased consumption and share gains in the quarter. Special K is performing well and the Kashi Cereal business is responding to the introduction of new products and all of our international businesses posted sales growth in the fourth quarter and we're on track to meet our expectations for 2016. We expect our momentum to continue. We've made changes where we needed to; we've improved our support; we're launching exciting new products; we've improved our foods through renovation, and we're executing well. And we also had significant flexibility in 2016 from Project K and the zero-based budgeting initiative. These two projects will give us an incremental $200 million of savings in 2016 that we will invest in revenue growth and use to improve margins.","So, as we step back and look at where we are, we built momentum in 2015. We generated significant savings. We launched a new strategy and we have a strong management team. And as we enter 2016, we are absolutely committed to our algorithm to deliver results through sales, operating profit and EPS, and to building long-term earnings visibility.","So, finally, I'd like to thank all of the Kellogg employees around the world. Your efforts are making a huge difference, and none of this would be possible without them.","And now, I'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] And our first question comes from David Driscoll of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, and good morning.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I wanted to ask just two questions. First on Cereal, can you talk about the impact of the U.S. sales force structure and the head count increases and kind of how it's impacted your Cereal operations? And then, specifically, John, I don't think you gave a sales growth. I mean, I think you said it for the Other segments, but what is your sales growth expectations for 2016 U.S. Morning Foods? And completely separately on ZBB, just love to hear a little bit more about your initial learnings on the program and then for you just to kind of talk about the size, this $100 million and kind of why is that the right number and what are you learning as you're going through the program?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, David. I'll take the Cereal questions and the sales growth questions. I'll hand ZBB over to Ron. There's no question that the additional investments made in our sales organization as part of our Project K reinvestments absolutely helped the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. In addition, our U.S. Cereal business has been helped by some of the great food improvements we've made, such as Special K Red Berries; some of the outstanding brand building programs we have such as the Raisin Bran program out there. But in-store execution this year has been significantly better than in the past and I think the U.S. sales reps, U.S. sales team have done a tremendous job of improving the in-store execution and driving the performance of that business.","Because of those changes, because of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. Cereal business, we actually are quite optimistic about 2016. I think if you asked me back on the third quarter conference call, our expectations for U.S. Cereal, we would have defined flat sales in 2016 as success. Given the strength of U.S. Cereal across 2015, we'd actually expect our U.S. Cereal business to grow slightly, a couple of percent in 2016.","The Morning Foods business obviously includes more things than just U.S. Cereal. There's the Pop-Tarts business in there, which is also doing well, and Health & Wellness business. But in aggregate, I'd say that total business we expect to be up slightly in 2016.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So in terms of zero-based budgeting, David, first, we're on track and the project is progressing well, as we had said. Now, remember, we're targeting over $2 billion worth of discretionary spend in North America for the start of the program, and the areas that we're targeting are in general administrative overhead, distribution costs, brand building and supply chain overhead as well. As we said, we still expect to save $100 million in 2016, but what I would point out is that's not a ceiling in terms of our savings, okay. This is a multiyear program and we obviously believe that there are more opportunities for savings and then we're implementing a process to make sure that we can sustain those savings. We are reinvesting some of those savings back into our business. For example, we're refining money in brand building. We're taking some opportunity to reinvest back into brand building for revenue growth. And as we've talked all along, we're investing money back into our food as well.","Our international regions are underway. So we have started the work in all of our international regions at this point in time. Kicked off the process, dissecting our spend, identifying the opportunities as well.","Some specific areas or learnings in terms of where we're seeing savings. So we look to cost of goods sold, for example, we've identified opportunities in our transportation and warehousing costs. We've done a deep dive in professional and contracted services and found some money there. And on people-related costs, things like travel, relocation, things of that nature, we've implemented policy changes to impact and benefit our cost structure. As I mentioned, we're finding some money in brand building as well around media, non-working media, as well as TV media. But, again, we're investing some of that back into the business to drive revenue growth. So overall, project is progressing well, remains on track.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I guess, the main question that I have is around U.S. Snacks. There wasn't much color on it in the presentation and the operating profits looked to be down pretty sharply. What's going on there? It's been weak for some time. When do you think you're going to get better traction on that side? Thank you, and I'll pass it on in the interest of time.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Alexia, and great question. You're right. We've had a disappointing couple of years in U.S. Snacks. We've talked a lot in the context of our Cereal business about Special K. The Special K has also had a fundamental impact to our Snacks business. We've had a headwind from Special K in Snacks over the last couple of years. You've seen that come through in our cracker business with Special K cracker chips. It's come through in our Wholesome Snacks business with Special K Bars. The good news is where we have renovated those foods similar to what we've done in Cereal, we're seeing the business stabilize. And so Special K cracker chips is stabilizing and Special K Chewy Nuts bars actually are doing quite well in the Wholesome Snacks business.","So if you look at that, that headwind is still there to a degree but to a much less degree. And as we go forward, we expect some of the tailwinds in the business to become more evident. So we've had strong growth in Cheez-It over the last several years. We're seeing good growth in Pringles; we're seeing good growth in Rice Krispies Treats and Wholesome Snacks. Our cookie business is stable the last couple of quarters. So we've actually seen better trends within the business.","So as we go forward into 2016, we expect to return this business to top line growth, although modest, and we absolutely expect to return the business to bottom line growth. So we recognize that's been an area of weakness for us. Deanie and the team have taken actions to address it and we feel much better about our 2016 outlook and you're actually seeing it in the consumption data even in 2015, and the consumption in the fourth quarter for 2015 was stronger than the prior parts of the year and we're seeing sequential improvement as we go through the year.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. And I'll see you next week at CAGNY.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Questions on margins. First, gross margin, I noticed in the Appendix you cited about 130 basis point tailwind from FX. Can you elaborate on the detail of what that is and give us some color in terms of the commodity backdrop that you've seen what inflation was last year, what your expectation is on the forward?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So let me just talk a little bit about our cost structure within cost of goods sold for 2016. Overall, we do expect net deflation driving gross margin expansion, and I'm speaking specifically excluding Venezuela. We're seeing a lot of volatility and inflation in Venezuela. So set Venezuela aside. Excluding Venezuela, we expect gross margin expansion. We are seeing raw and packaging material deflation in 2016. We also have our base productivity improvements, Project K, and we've set Project K that $100 million. About 75% to 80% of that runs through cost of goods sold.","On the zero-based budgeting savings that we quoted, a little less than half of that is coming through cost of goods sold. But remember, Jason, we've said all along that we were going to invest in our food, and we've done that in 2015, and we're doing it in 2016. Renovating our foods, and launching granolas and mueslis based on consumer trends that we're seeing. That investment in food remains at about a 50 basis point headwind in relation to our gross margin performance.","The other thing that we have impacting us in 2016 is some transactional currency exposure. So we had good hedges in 2015, some of those are rolling off and what we're seeing is some headwind, particularly around the Canadian dollar and the peso, but also some of the other international currencies as they've weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Now we're seeing about a 40 basis point headwind in relation to transactional currency exposure. So all up, slight net deflation and some gross margin expansion in 2016.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Great color. One more question on margins, a bit higher order. Just looking at North America overall, you seem to set \u2013 I guess, our model goes back to 2003, we can't find a year where margins were this low in North America. I don't know if you go further back in time, kind of how far you have to go to get down to the 15% level?","Looking across the space in food, your margins are going up. You look at your portfolio and you contemplate it and then you look at your margins and there seems to be a mismatch. What are the impediments of you getting back to that near 20% type margin that you had a bit more than a decade ago and what's the glide path forward to try to get there?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Jason, if you go back to our Investor Day and what we shared at the Investor Day, and I believe we even showed a chart at CAGNY, we did say that we had operating margin improvement opportunities in North America, where we may expect to grow our sales around low-single digits over the long-term. We said we had 200 to 250 basis points worth of operating margin expansion. And as you look at 2016 and how you'll see that play out for North America, you will see strong operating margin expansion within that business as a result of the zero-based budgeting work that they are doing and also savings from Project K.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jason, if I could just add to what Ron said, there's absolutely no impediment to us improving our margins. We're absolutely committed to doing that. You'll see that in 2016 and beyond.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Good luck, guys. Thank you very much.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Two questions for me, if I can. One just a clarification, the commentary on the pacing of EPS that it would be roughly evenly distributed per quarter, I just want to make sure. Was that a reference to absolute EPS dollars or to EPS growth year-on-year? I assume the former, just wanted to make sure.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","You're absolutely right, Ken. So that's EPS dollars based on the things that I mentioned in terms of currency headwinds and below the line.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Ron. And then, I guess this question is for anyone who wants to take it, but Nielsen data, they're really showing a very steep decline in private label cereal takeaway and it's very recent and sudden. Did this correspond with what you're seeing in the market? I appreciate that you and your branded peers are doing better, but that drop-off seems kind of unusual and it makes me wonder if it's accurately representing what's truly happening out there.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Ken, on private label data, you get the same data that we do. I think private label has been soft in a number of our categories now for a number of years. And I suspect what's happening there is that the U.S. consumer is getting stronger. Obviously, lower petrol prices is putting more cash into people's pockets, et cetera. And at the same time, you've got the branded players I think playing a much better game. We're investing back in our food. We've got strong brands. We've got outstanding in-store execution. All of those elements drive our business and provide a stronger offering. And, so, I think the trends, not just in Cereal, not just in the U.S., but in some of the other markets, but also in some of the other categories in the U.S., we've seen pretty weak private label sales now for a number of years.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. See you next week.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I had two questions; one, clarification of free cash flow and then another sort of broader. The broader question is I see the improvement that's occurring in U.S. Morning Foods driven by Cereal. It's obviously positive, but it does seem like the one area that does continue to hinder much more accentuated top line growth is your snack bars. So I'm wondering, as you think about the Snack Bar category in general and relative to Cereal, what are the main differences you see to actually being able to recapture growth and take share and improve the top line off of a somewhat depressed Snack Bar performance relative to what you're doing in Cereal? And the reason why I ask is we've done a lot of work that just has shown that there really hasn't been that many new players in cereal over the past few years, but over the past, let's say, three to five years, there's just been a massive influx of brands that might make the category a bit more competitive. Thanks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, great question. So within our U.S. Snacks business, we have four large segments or businesses, one of which is Wholesome Snacks. Within that, the key is to have great food that's on trend. Where we have that, we're growing strongly. So, Rice Krispies Treats is up high single digits in the fourth quarter. Some of our foods, though, are not as on-trend as they need to be. We've been renovating some of that food with Special K Chewy Nut Bar. We have worked on Nutri-Grain, et cetera, some Nutri-Grain bars coming out. So we believe we have strong brands.","Our Wholesome Snacks piece is more about ensuring all of our foods are on trend. There's work that's been done there. We've done that work; we've seen better results and there's still more to do.","But if you look at that Snacks business in totality, we have other large businesses in there beyond just the Cereal bar side, including crackers, where we have a strongly advantaged footprint, particularly with Cheez-It, where we're seeing strong growth. We have Pringles, and for Pringles around the world, we're seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and low-single-digit growth in North America. We believe we have an opportunity to drive much more growth around Pringles in North America as we go into 2016 and that will help our U.S. Snacks results. We have great areas of strength within cookies as well.","So, as you think about our Snacks business, yes, there's some challenges on Wholesome Snacks. I think the answer to that is renovate, improve the food, continue to have strong brands, continue to execute in store, but it's really a food discussion. I think we're making great progress there. And then we have other sources of growth within that Snacks business. That's why we have confidence we'll get that business back to growth in 2016.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a quick clarification on free cash flow, I know your guidance for the year is $1.1 billion, again, I know in 2015, you called out, you said $330 million of cash for Project K then that was offset by the supplier financing. When we think about 2016, I'm not sure if you stated it before, but if so, I'm sorry, if you could just remind me what the Project K cash outflow is expected to be net of supplier financing improvements, if there are any?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So let me give you a little bit of color on how our cash flow kind of holds together and the $1.1 billion that we guided after capital spending. And first, I think it's important to note that in 2016, we are converting net income to cash flow after capital spending at a rate of 100%. And in 2015, we actually did better than that. So we have a slightly elevated capital spending in 2016. We're in the 4% to 5% range. That includes Pringles growth, some capital behind that growth, and then as well some cash for Project K.","Our cash for Project K is a couple of $100 million and what we're doing is we're continuing to roll out that supplier financing initiative to offset the cash requirements for Project K. We did just that in 2015 and we were able to offset the cash requirements for Project K based on the improvements we saw in our core working capital. So, we're expecting the same thing in 2016, and that's what's allowing us to convert our net income to cash at 100%.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yep.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess I wanted just a clarification on Venezuela, and thank you for the disclosure you put at the end of the press release because I think it really helps to clarify quite a bit. But I just wanted to make sure, so in the fourth quarter, Venezuela, because of the pricing, contributed about a little over 3.5% to currency neutral sales growth and it contributed about 2.5% to currency neutral operating income growth.","So as we look at your guidance, and I heard you comment about revenues, you're basically I guess my interpretation of it is, to the extent that it has sort of impact on revenues, you're still looking at you're one to three as if, kind of normal. So if Venezuela contributes significantly more, there could potentially be upside to revenues. Would that same hold true for operating income as well? To the extent that it has the potential to deliver this type of impact on the growth to operating income, would you be looking at operating income the same way in terms of the effect of what a normal growth would be and how Venezuela affects it?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Bryan. Good question. And let me just kind of run through how Venezuela is impacting things. First, as we said in the prepared remarks, Venezuela was always included in our sales guidance, back in August, as we gave the original guidance. We always expected about a point of contribution from Venezuela to our sales performance. It's hard to predict and it's gotten even harder as inflation increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on our projections that could continue as we move to 2016 as well and that's why we said we could see sales growth exceed the 1% to 3% range as a result of pricing actions we'll take in Venezuela to offset inflation and make sure that our business stays profitable.","So we said excluding Venezuela, we still expect to be in that 1% to 3% range on sales. And also, on operating profit and earnings per share, excluding Venezuela, we expect to be in the ranges that we communicated. Okay?","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now, remember, we're pricing to offset inflation. So it's possible that could throw off more profit but it remains to be seen. There are margin controls within Venezuela. Some may have the question as well, so why haven't we deconsolidated Venezuela, and let me just put that out there.","In terms of Venezuela, we operate in a preferred industry, food, within the country and most of our inputs are locally sourced. Remember, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, one of the key criteria for deconsolidating is exchangeability of currency. We've been able to exchange bolivar for U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 and also here in January of 2016. We have control over our business. As I said, we're profitable in local currency as well. We re-measured to the SIMADI rate in 2015 so it has become a smaller portion of our business as a result of that. We continue to monitor and manage the business and our team there is doing a superb job at that.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you. And thanks for the clarity on that. It's really helpful.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO. Please go ahead.","Vishal Bhailal Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Vishal in for Ken. Just a quick question for me. I wanted to confirm your response to an earlier question, I think you said that the global rollout of ZBB has already started. Is it fair to say that some of that margin improvement may flow through the P&L ahead of the late 2016 schedule that you kind of outlined at your Investor Day? And that's it for me. Thanks.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So it remains to be seen. Obviously, our teams are progressing that initiative as fast as possible. We haven't provided any outlook in terms of 2016 from the international regions and we'll provide you an update when we have that, but our teams are trying to generate savings as quickly as possible from ZBB.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just one thing I would add to that, if you think about Project K, that's that is giving us additional savings in 2016, 2017, 2018. We have ZBB for North America in 2016, additional rollout in 2017, international will be partially 2016, 2017, 2018. What we're working on as a company is not just having great earnings visibility into 2016 but into 2017, 2018 and beyond. So we're building a long-term pipeline of productivity programs here to drive that long-term earnings visibility.","Vishal Bhailal Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate it. Thanks.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe this is a better question for CAGNY. But you've got hundreds of millions of ongoing productivity savings. You've identified ZBB, Project K savings on top of that. And I think, John, at the Analyst Day you had said we spend the right amount on advertising today and, if anything, we'll kind of optimize that and make it more efficient so there aren't necessarily incremental dollars going into that. It isn't clear to me why more of the savings aren't assumed to be helping your EBIT growth?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Eric, firstly, I think you're right on brand building, we have industry-leading levels of brand building. Obviously investing in our brands is important, but we have enough fuel in the tank to do what we need to do. So as you look at 2016, we expect our brand building to be largely flat to 2015. So I think we have the money there that we need to have.","Obviously we are, as I told you, back at Day K, we're very focused on improving margins over time and we're very, very focused on getting back on our long-term growth algorithm. Our long-term growth algorithm, our 4% to 6% operating profit bottom line growth is a target, it's not a ceiling, and obviously the company will continue to do what we can do to drive performance over time.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But \u2013 so, I guess, borrowing some bonus for Simon or something, you've got savings of \u2013 or you've got reinvestment in the quality of the food, right, as a partial offset, but then I think you said ZBB can kind of cover that. Maybe we'll follow up at CAGNY but it seems to me that the number is, especially of advertising is flattish, along with deflation, the numbers don't really add up to what is relatively modest margin expansion.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Eric, I think some of the $100 million of ZBB savings are within the brand building line, it's likely to get spent back into the brand building line. As you look at 2016, we're obviously continuing to invest back into our food. We're also investing back into the emerging markets. So I think you'll start to see the strategy to come through even in the regional results. As you look at 2016, we expect strong profit growth in North America and Europe, but now we're investing back in Asia Pacific and Latin America. So you'll see our investment decisions and where we're driving for margin come through our results as we go through 2016.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then last one for Ron just as a follow up to make sure I got it. The $0.04 of Venezuela hit in the first half of this year, and I think you said $0.02 to $0.03 of JV cost, are you excluding that or including those items?","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So the $0.04 on Venezuela in the front part of the year is part of the $0.10 of currency that I communicated. So that rolls right through our comparable earnings per share performance. The $0.02 to $0.03 is integration costs. And we do typically walk those out of comparable. That's to integrate those businesses.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. See you next week. Thanks.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yep. Thank you. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. And our final question will come from Eric Larson of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, everybody. Congratulations, team on really getting that sales momentum back on track. It's very encouraging. Ron, I just would like to follow-up. I have two quick questions. I'd just like to follow-up a little bit more on your free cash. Obviously, you've got some new capacity going into Pringles around the globe. Is some of your new growth initiatives \u2013 will most of that capital be a 2016 event, or will some of that carry into 2017? I guess, what I'm trying to do is get a feel for what we could see in 2017. And I know it is way too early for any kind of guidance, but I'm looking at the timing of your capital projects.","Ronald L. Dissinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, fair enough and we're not trying to guide on capital spending for 2017 at this point in time. But on Pringles, I'd say we're growing this business very quickly, as John mentioned. We're growing high-single digits overall as a company and double-digits in some of the regions. So we're investing capital in 2016, but we see a glide path for continued growth and likely continued capital investment. Obviously, we're trying to squeeze as much capacity out of the current assets that we have, Eric, but we'll continue to invest behind that business as long as we're seeing strong growth.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Good. And then a question for either Ron or John but it relates to the first question, I think, that Dave asked in the conference call. And it's a meaningful investment that you made in your direct sales force in the U.S. Cereal business. The question that I have, as you get your Wholesome Snacks business, you get the right food and you invest in your food in that business and get everything lined up. Structurally, will your U.S. sales force, direct sales force, be responsible for the in-store market for your Wholesome Snacks or how is that structured?","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's great question. As we think about our business, we require three things to really drive our business. One is to have great food. Second is strong bands and the third is in-store execution. And you think about that in-store execution, as you say, we're very pleased with the U.S. Cereal business, which is a warehouse sales organization. Our Snacks business is a DSD sales organization. We've made investments back into that organization as well. We're very happy with the power of DSD and the ability to win in-store with that system. I think the opportunity in our Snacks business is making sure the food is absolutely on trend and that's where we're focused and making great progress.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, everyone, and congrats again.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","John A. Bryant - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, everyone. Thanks very much. We'll be around, as usual, for questions, and we look forward to seeing everybody next week. Thanks.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Welcome to the Kellogg Company Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.","All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Please note this event is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for the Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter 2017 results. I\u2019m joined this morning by; Steve Cahillane, our CEO who will provide an overview of the quarter and the year in context of our strategy and then we'll come back and review our key businesses; and Fareed Khan, Chief Financial Officer, who will walk you through our 2017 financial results and our 2018 financial outlook.","Slide number two shows our usual forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, profit margins, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.","A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, February 15. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. Briefly, I want to be sure that you are all aware of some changes to our statements of results and guidance.","Specifically, there are two accounting standards changes that we have been discussing in our previous filings and that finally will go into effect into Q1 2018, it's also relatively small transfer of products between two segments within Kellogg North America. Our press release includes explanations of these changes and preliminary figures to help you recast 2017.","Our 2018 guidance will be off this recast 2017 base. Separately, we will be modifying our presentation of non-GAAP measurements to better align how we assess our business internally. In effect we are changing the term currency neutral comparable to the more commonly used organic and we will no longer strip out completed acquisitions or divestitures from our sales and profit guidance but we will provide color on them.","Today for consistency reasons we'll continue to discuss results for Q4 and full year 2017 on the previous currency neutral comparable basis and before any of these accounting-related restatements to 2017. However, we will talk about 2018 guidance on the new basis.","And now I'll turn it over to Steve and slide number four.","Steven Cahillane","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, I'd like to start off by saying that after four months into the job my confidence in this company and my excitement to be here have only increased.","In fact, having been around the world discussing our strategy and plans I'm even more convinced that we will return to solid sustainable growth. The brands are strong, the foods are unique, the culture is special. What we have to do is prioritize, invest where the growth is and improve our execution, but our Q4 performance gives a very good indication of exactly what I'm talking about.","We finished the year on sound financial footing. Not only did we deliver on our guidance for all key financial metrics but our second half net sales performance was vastly improved from the first half. Pringles got back on track globally, our Frozen Foods brand in the U.S. accelerated their growth, U.S.","Specialty channels sustained its growth, our emerging markets business improve their growth and we stabilized our core develop international cereal markets. We also delivered strong profit margin expansion indicating a reduction of cost structure that keeps us on track for our targeted margin expansion from 2015 to 2018.","We reduced core working capital as a percent of sales, improved our cash conversion and increasing our cash flow. Excuse me. And we continue to return substantial cash to shareowners through a strong dividend and sustained share buybacks.","But more importantly, we made big strategic moves in 2017 that will help us in 2018 and beyond. Our transition out of DSD was well-executed and sets us up to invest more behind our brands in order to get back to growth in that business.","We continue to expand Pringles across the globe via market expansion, new flavors and new pack formats. We worked on brand positioning, media campaigns and new foods to help stabilize what has been our principal source of sales decline, Special K as well as our overall cereal business in core developed international markets, both showed strong signs of stabilizing in the second half.","We know emerging markets are huge opportunity and in 2017, we integrated and anticipated growth in Parati, which tripled our scale in Brazil and provides further growth and cost synergies for us going forward. Through our joint ventures we are rapidly expanding in West Africa and China, where we are building distribution and brand awareness in big emerging markets.","And around the world, we have reinvested resources in e-commerce and it paid off with exceptional growth. And we acquired RXBAR, giving us a whole new growth platform. So, 2017 was an important year for us as we were able to deliver dependable results while making progress on key strategic initiatives, many of which were quite challenging.","Now let's turn our attention to 2018 and slide number 5. We would characterize 2018 as a transition year and here's why. We are completing the actions behind our ambitious Project K restructuring program while beginning plans on our next productivity opportunities.","We strive for balance between profitability, investment and growth and this restructuring gives us the fuel. In U.S. Snacks, we're transitioning to life after DSD. This includes a little more than two quarters worth of impact from the adjusted list price and SKU rationalization but it also entails operating differently and it concludes ramp-up in investments behind our brands.","We will be increasing brand building investment in other business units as well. This varies by brand of course and for some it is the quality of ideas that we are improving rather than simply investing more dollars. But this reinvestment is important for building momentum as the year progresses.","We will be integrating and growing our latest acquisition, RXBAR. There is so much we can do with this new growth platform. Meanwhile, we will be building on our other relatively recent acquisition, Parati in Brazil, completing the integration and accelerating planned revenue and cost synergies.","And our joint ventures in West Africa and China we'll continue to invest behind rapid expansion. Despite being a transition year, we have a plan reflected in our guidance that delivers continued gradual improvement in net sales performance, strong reinvestment in our brands and continued growth in operating profit.","From a margin perspective, we will achieve the equivalent of our 18% operating profit margin target, excluding depending accounting changes. We will continue to grow our earnings per share and cash flow with an additional boost from U.S. tax reform even after using some of this benefit to de-risk our balance sheet and pension liability. I think we have a balanced plan for 2018 and I believe our Q4 in 2017 actions and results offer confidence that we can achieve this.","So, before I get into the fundamentals of each of our businesses, let me turn it over to Fareed who will walk you through the financials in more detail.","Fareed Khan","Thanks, Steve, and good morning. Slide six shows a summary of our financial results for the quarter and the full year. Net sales in the quarter continued to improve from the first half, even with the full impact of planned DSD related list price adjustments and SKU rationalizations in our U.S. Snacks business. We continue to make progress towards returning to growth.","Operating profit showed another quarter of solid growth and operating profit margin continued to expand. In Q4, we achieved this even with a double-digit year-on-year increase in brand building investment. Earnings per share grew in Q4 as well as the operating profit growth more than offset the impact of a higher tax rate and an increase in interest expense related to our RXBAR acquisition.","Excluded from comparable EPS, of course, are items like upfront costs, which came in in line with our guidance. You may also be wondering about U.S. tax reform. The net impact to 2017 was small as the onetime reduction and deferred tax liabilities was more than offset by the onetime charge for repatriation of foreign earnings and other eliminated deductions. This resulted in less than a penny per share negative impact in Q4. We'll speak more about the ongoing tax reform benefit in a moment.","We're pleased with our Q4 and full year 2017 results. Our topline did improvement in the second half as we indicated it would, our productivity initiatives delivered under savings, helping us to boost margins and delivered solid profit and earnings growth, and we delivered on our guidance for each of the key P&L metrics are shown on this slide as well as for cash flow. So, let's get into a little bit more detail.","Slide seven shows the sequential improvement in currency neutral comparable net sales performance that we generated in the second half. Driving the second half improvement were several factors. First, Pringles return to growth in Europe after an unusual decline in the first half.","Second, our U. S. Frozen brands, Eggo and Morningstar Farms picked up momentum that started in Q2. Third we stabilized key international developed cereal markets, even growing sales in Q4 in Canada, Australia and the U.K.","Fourth, we slowed the declines of Special K globally, even gaining share in the U. S. and U.K. cereal markets in Q4. And we improve our growth in emerging markets led by Q -- led by second half accelerations in Asia and the Middle East.","Remember, our net sales in both Q3 and Q4 have to absorb a planned negative 2% headwind resulting from the DSD exit in U.S. Snacks. This came in the form of SKU rationalization and list price adjustments. There was negligible impact in the first half, so the entire headwind was effectively in the second half. This was in line with our expectations for Q4 as it had been in the prior quarter.","When you exclude the mechanical negative impact of the DSD transition, our sales were up year-on-year in Q3 and up a little bit more in Q4. So clearly, we're starting to see underlying improvement in our topline. That said, we're not content with the sales decline by any means and returning to growth is a top priority for us.","Let's turn to profitability on slide eight where we showed the latest savings figures for Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting. As a status update, the bulk of the investments and actions for Project K are largely behind us even if the savings runs through 2019, and the same goes for ZBB, which is now our discipline incorporated into our daily operations.","There's no question that we reduced the cost structure of our business with these actions. So, we have good visibility into our cost structure going into the next couple of years as we continue to execute against these initiatives.","Slide 9 shows that these productivity efforts again paid off in the form of higher operating profit margins in Q4 and the full year.","In fact, we finished the year with an operating profit margin of 16.9% which is 250 basis points higher than the level we recorded in 2015 putting us well in the way towards the 2015 to 2018 target we set a few years ago.","On operating profit margin, we posted another quarter of strong expansion, led by efficiencies and savings initiatives in SG&A most significantly from the elimination of DSD related overhead.","In fact, this overhead reduction was large enough to more than offset a substantial increase in brand building across the company in Q4 both in U.S. Snacks and elsewhere.","And it almost immediately brought U.S. Snacks towards the Kellogg North American operating profit margin average in Q4 even with the sizable reimbursements I mentioned. Gross profit margin in the quarter was again reduced but was effectively a reset of U.S. Snacks gross margin as it shifts out of DSD and into warehouse.","As discussed previously this involves a list price adjustment for the cost to serve of services will no longer be providing to the retailer along with some logistics costs that now be captured in cost of goods sold as it resets the divisions gross margin to a new lower level.","However, excluding this DSD related reset in U.S. Snacks, the company's gross margin was up year-on-year both in Q4 and full year. Savings from Project K supply chain restructuring and Zero-Based Budgeting continue to more than offset the cost of investing in our food and packaging and the operating leverage impact of lower volume.","Our cash flow performance is shown on slide 10. In 2017 our cash flow was on our guidance and ahead of last year. It says something about the durability of our cash flow through that through all the changes we are making.","All the investments and restructuring we're executing, we can still deliver strong and consistent cash flow. Strong working capital improvement has funded nearly $1 billion of restructuring related outlays over the past few years not to mention elevated capital for expenditures for Pringles on other growth and efficiency investments.","This durable cash flow gives us good financial flexibility and we expect to increase cash flow again in 2018. So solid financial performance in 2017 and with that let's turn our sites into 2018 starting with our outlook for the top line.","On slide 11 you'll see our outlook for net sales broken into key elements. First, the DSD transition, because the list price adjustment and SKU rationalizations really didn't go into full effect until mid-Q3 of 2017 we'll have about two quarters of negative 2% impact to total company net sales just as we saw in Q3 and Q4 of 2017.","This translates into about 1% negative impact for the full year. Excluding this DSD impact, our underlying business should continue to show improvement. We saw this in the second half of 2017 and this should continue into 2018.","Pringles Europe is back in growth U.S. Frozen is back in growth, specialty channels continues to grow and we're stabilizing our core developed international cereal markets.","In addition, we boosted brand building investment in Q4 and this increased investment will continue into 2018 supporting key brands and with promising growth opportunities.","Consumption trends don't approve immediately of course, but they should improve as the year progresses. That's why we think our underlying business can move towards flat sales in 2018.","Additionally, we've got RXBAR adding to our reported net sales growth between the acquired sales and the sustained growth momentum we see in the business, this could add another 1 to 2 percentage points of growth for us in 2018.","With that, let's turn to Slide 12 and how we are looking at operating profit for 2018. Our productivity initiatives give us good visibility into cost savings. We expect to realize more than half of the remaining Project K savings in 2018 as well as all of the remaining Zero-Based Budgeting savings. Some of this will be used to cover modest cost inflation led by a rising transportation cost and a good portion of this will be reinvested into our brands.","As you know, the reinvestment into demand pull brand building was a key element of our transition out of DSD and so you can expect double-digit increases in brand building in our U.S. Snacks business as well as smaller increases to our other businesses. Newly acquired RXBAR contributes about 1 to 2 percentage points to our expected operating profit growth, reflecting not only the acquired profit but also its expected year-over-year growth.","From a margin standpoint, remember that gross margin will face that headwind of the DSD-related reset I mentioned earlier, but behind that should be continued productivity led improvement and modest price realization. And at the operating margin level, we'll see strong expansion as overhead savings related primarily to the DSD exit more than offset the reinvestments in brand building. In fact, on the old GAAP basis, currency neutral comparable and before the pension accounting changes, we would hit the 18% operating margin target that we established for 2018.","From a quarterly phasing perspective, keep in mind that our step up in brand building began in late Q3 of 2017 and we'll continue through the first half of 2018, holding our operating profit to relatively modest growth during Q1 and Q2 before accelerating in the second half.","So now let's turn to Slide 13, our guidance for EPS. Before U.S. tax reform was passed, there was little difference between the operating profit growth and EPS growth because of offsetting items like higher interest expense related to the debt incurred to acquire RXBAR last October, an increase other income reflecting a higher pension asset-based following last year's strong financial markets performance.","But this below the line leverage changes meaningfully with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Through a lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by a reduced or eliminated deductions, this reform will bring our overall corporate effective tax rate to something closer to 20% to 21% or about 5 to 6 points lower than our 2017 rate.","For now, we view this benefit as an opportunity to improve our financial flexibility. For example, we can use the tax reform cash flow benefit to deleverage our capital structure on the heels of our acquisition of RXBAR in December, the timing is right to pay down some debt and keep our drive for future opportunities this means less of year-over-year opportunities in interest expense.","Additionally, we can take a more conservative approach to our pension funds by making a cash contribution and\/or shifting to a less aggressive investment mix to be accompanied by a reduction or expect a return on assets assumptions. This pulls down other income year-over-year.","Our EPS would have grown anyway this year but this tax reform gives it an added boost. The result is an adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11% year-on-year, another year of strong earnings growth. This of course is a currency neutral outlook. Currencies are always volatile and you've seen some swings in the past couple of months. Our best estimate right now is for currency translation to be modestly positive in 2018.","Slide 14 puts it all together. Flat currency neutral net sales showing sequential improvement in underlying brands, strong currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth, even with the increased brand building investment and strong currency neutral adjusted EPS growth helped additionally, by tax reform. It also includes cash flow. We expect cash flow of roughly $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion another year-on-year increase aided by benefits from U.S. tax reform.","Overall, we think our 2018 guidance -- outlook offers a good balance between savings and reinvestment, between top line improvement and sustained operating profit growth and we think it leaves us with greater financial flexibility for the future. So, I agree with Steve, we are entering 2018 on sound financial footing and we have the plans that will strengthen even further across the year.","And with that, let me turn it back over to Steve for a review of our businesses.","Steven Cahillane","Thanks, Fareed. Let's start with our largest youth business unit U.S. Snacks in slide number 15. In Q4 this business unit posted another quarter of strong operating profit growth, owing to the reduction of DSD overhead and partially offset by a plan substantial increase in brand building, which should help build momentum heading into 2018. You can see the strong net impact on snacks operating profit margin.","In Q4, the impact of our DSD transition, namely our price adjustment and our SKU rationalization came in as expected. Roughly eight percentage points of negative impact to U.S. Snacks sales or about 2% negative impact to the overall company.","This implies underlying growth for this business unit just as we saw in Q3. This might have been aided by higher trade inventories as retailers are still finding their optimal level for this new set of products in their warehouse but this performance certainly indicates that we are on the right track.","Following our pullback in merchandising in late Q2 and early Q3 related to the DSD transition, we started to get back into normal promotional activity in Q4 and we supported key brands with increased advertising. This started with crackers as the holiday season is an important one for this category and we saw almost immediate resumption in consumption growth from our two biggest cracker brands, Cheez-It and Club.","We also improved consumption on key supported brands in our other categories, Keebler Fudge Shoppe and Famous Amos and cookies and Rice Krispies Treats and a wholesome snacks. As I mentioned previously, we're please so far with the execution of an initiative that was enormously complex and risky. We completed the exit on time and on budget and we received favorable feedback across our customer base.","Now we are working through operating and competing in this new way of going to market in the supermarket channel. There will be some noise, at least through the first half of 2018. We've already discussed the noise in the P&L with the gross margin reset and big overhead savings offsetting increased brand building. But there's also noise in the scanner data.","Through the first half of 2018, we know we'll see lower ACV owing to our SKU rationalization and we fully expect the decline in secondary and tertiary displays. All of this was planned.","We're pleased with our shelf assortment and we believe that the added brand building investment will continue to drive gradual improvement in our consumption and share performance. If you're looking for a lead indicator, it is velocity. A shelf strengthened by rationalizing tail SKUs and brand supported with more brand building point to gradually improving velocities.","And as you can see on the Chart, this improvement in velocity is already starting to take shape. So, the message is we're on track, we've got a couple more quarters of year-on-year noise, but we feel good about where we're headed. The results should be gradually improving sales with another year of strong operating profit growth.","Now let's turn to slide number 16 in U.S. Morning Foods. The quarter\u2019s operating profit decline was exaggerated by being up against an outsized 29% gain in the year ago quarter. But what was the disappointing was that the cereal category did not improve on its year-to-date decline rate in Q4.","As we've stated previously, we know what it takes to grow this category, it takes exciting food news centered around health benefits and taste and combined with effective brand building and in-store execution. And we and others simply didn't bring enough of that to the category last year. So that's where our focus is. And Special K in Q4 can give you a glimpse of how we're getting back to this playbook. ","In the second half we properly married up food news with an effective media campaign and in-store activation and we saw good results. The brand stabilized in its consumption and return to share growth.","Similarly, we realized improved performance in Q4 for Pop-Tarts, a brand that had an uncharacteristic decline in the first half, driving this improvement were commercial plans with strong in-store display activation.","Morning Foods enters 2018 with a stronger commercial plan both in terms of bigger on trend ideas and in terms of higher brand building investments. In late December, we launched a truly unique cereal offering, Special K with probiotics, leaning into abutting and justified consumer interest in digestive health.","We recently launched chocolate frosted flakes, already the number one innovation at many retailers and we've gotten off to a good start to the year. We know we can stabilize this business, we did it in 2016 and we did it this year in our other core developed cereal markets. We expect to see Morning Foods operating profit way down by increased commercial investment in 2018, but with gradually improving sales performance.","Let's now turn to Specialty Channels shown on slide number 17. This business unit posted its 10th straight quarter of sales and profit growth in Q4 and this was in spite of the toughest comparisons of the year on both metrics. So, this business unit has put together a really impressive track record.","Sales growth in the quarter was delivered by each of our three core channels, Foodservice, Convenience Stores and Vending. Foodservice was aided by additional FEMA orders in the aftermath of hurricanes in the Southeastern United States and all three channels benefited from innovation and distribution gains.","Margin expansion also continued in the quarter on the strength of ZBB and RGM efforts. These are important and growing channels for us and our sustained momentum reflects our continued focus on winning wherever the shopper shops.","In 2018, we expect to see continued growth in sales and share. We'll have to laps some unusual benefits such as hurricane-related shipments in Q3 and Q4 of 2017, but we will continue to grow this business. Profit maybe down, but that's only because of some reallocation of manufacturing and warehousing costs from other North America business units.","Now let's talk about our North America other segment, shown on slide number 18. This segment posted another quarter of sales and profit growth in Q4, closing out the year with an impressive second half.","U.S. Frozen Foods sustained its momentum with both Eggo and MorningStar Farms, posting strong growth in consumption and share. Eggo continues to benefit from a reformulation to remove artificial flavors and colors as well as the continued success of Disney-Shaped waffles.","MorningStar Farms is being driven by effective brand building and in-store support, emphasizing our core on trend, delicious, grilling items. Canada also posted another quarter of sales growth where the growth across our portfolio.","Most impressive has been a return to share gains this year in cereal, where brands across our portfolio are responding to innovation and commercial programs. At Kashi company, while we continue to work to stabilize the Kashi brand outside the natural channel, its fourth quarter was highlighted by the continued momentum of our Bear Naked brand, which has become the number one Granola brand in the U.S. behind on trend innovation and expanded distribution. North America other carries momentum into 2018 led by Frozen. We'll also build on the incredible growth of newly acquired RXBAR.","Turning to Europe in slide number 19, this region had its best quarter of the year in Q4 from a top line perspective. Not only did we get back to growth, we did it across our portfolio.","Pringles continues its return to growth following our interrupted promotional activity in the first half. This brand is back on track in developed markets and continuing its expansion in emerging markets like Russia, Central Eastern Europe and Turkey.","Cereal sales grew in the quarter. We grew in the U.K. where we have successfully stabilized share with increased advertising behind core brands. Not only did Crunchy Nut, Corn Flakes and Craig gained share on improved velocities but so did Special K.","We also improved our performance across continental Europe in particular France and Italy. Wholesome snacks also posted increased net sales in Q4 with notable contribution from expansion in the Middle East.","Europe was one of the businesses were reelected to add some incremental brand building investment in Q4. This pulled down operating profit in the quarter but bodes well for sustaining our improved sales and consumption performance.","Europe's fourth quarter performance gives us confidence as we head into 2018. Pringles is back in growth with more expansion to come. Our emerging markets businesses especially markets like Egypt and Russia will continue to grow.","And while the developed U.K. and continental Europe markets remained difficult, we're confident we can maintain a stabilization via improved commercial plans such as health and wellness-oriented innovations.","And on the operating profit line, we should continue to benefit from productivity initiatives. Slide number 20 discusses Latin America. All year our soft top line and bottom line performance in this region was attributable to one particular sub-region, Caribbean, Central America.","Just as we were getting out from under an overhang of trade inventory in the first half, business got substantially interrupted by Hurricanes Maria and Irma in Puerto Rico in late Q3.","Business remained challenging through Q4 but we started to see signs of stabilization. Outside of Caribbean\/Central America we again posted growth. In Mexico, our biggest business in Latin America our consumption and sales were up in both cereal and snacks, finishing a good year.","In the more economically challenged -- in America served sub-region our cereal sales were down but this was offset by strong expansion in snacks. And not fully in these currency neutral comparable results was Parati.","Acquired in December 2016, this business tripled our scale in Brazil, and despite very challenging economic conditions, the business posted double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and full year 2017.","It's now largely integrated and is showing in market momentum and it has great plans for expansion. In 2018 we should see stabilization in Caribbean\/Central America steady growth in Mexico and momentum in Parati.","The result should be improved performance for Latin America, both on the top line and the bottom line. We'll finish off with Asia Pacific on slide number 21 Asia Pacific had another strong quarter with solid top line and bottom line growth.","We grew in both cereal and snacks. Cereal growth was led by rapid growth in India and Korea and we also posted another quarter of growth in our very developed Australia cereal business.","As we've discussed previously, we have stabilized this business, growing consumption and share through food news and media behind our health and wellness brands as well as innovation and brand building behind our taste-oriented brands.","Snacks growth was driven by both the Pringles and wholesome snacks. Pringles' continued growth was broad-based across the region driven by emerging markets as well as Australia and Korea.","Wholesome snacks still a relatively small business for us in this region posted a especially strong growth in Korea and we're in the early phases of launching these products elsewhere in Asia and Africa.","It's important to remember that these results do not include our joint ventures in West Africa and China. Once again, these operations posted strong double-digit net sales growth year-on-year, continuing to build scale and brand awareness for us in these emerging markets. If these JVs were consolidated, we'll be reporting a significantly larger growth rate in Asia Pacific and in fact, one of the fastest growth rates in our peer group in that region.","So, Asia Pacific finished strongly in what was a very good year in 2017. We expect Asia Pacific to continue to be a growth driver for us in 2018, led by cereal and Pringles expansion in Asia. Though not in our consolidated results, we'll also continue to expand our joint ventures.","So, allow me to summarize with slide number 22. First, I'm so excited to be here at this company, at this time. We have special brands, special foods, special people and a special culture. These are key ingredients and we have an organization that is hungry to win again.","We're coming of the year in which we gained traction in several businesses, reduce our cost structure, improved our working capital and delivered strong profit and earnings growth that was in line with our guidance.","We're on sound financial footing going into the New Year. We make big important strategic moves. The transition out of DSD was central to accelerating growth and margin expansion. We boosted our emerging market scale by growing organically while integrating Parati in Brazil and rapidly expanding our joint ventures reach and product line in Africa and China.","We acquired RXBAR, filling in a white space for us and offering us a new growth platform and we boosted our resources in sales in the rapidly growing e-commerce channel. We are on our way back towards topline growth.","Net sales guidance for 2018 reflects roughly two quarters of negative DSD transition impacts and the prudent assumption that it will take sometime for our investments to take hold. Our commercial ideas are stronger and we are putting increased investment where the growth is. We have strong cost savings that enables us to boost investment in growth while still delivering on margin expansion and solid profit and earnings growth.","We'll go into more detail at CAGNY in a couple of weeks. When we'll discussed where I see the most promising growth potential and how our growth trajectory might look over the next few years. I also look forward to meeting many of you while there. I'd like to finish my thanking our employees for their incredible dedication and hard work.","And with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Steven Cahillane","Good morning Alexia.","Fareed Khan","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","Hi there. I guess, I'd like to focus on the morning foods segment because the sales trends have been particularly challenged in their even against a negative comp from a year ago. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics there? It looks as though your key competitor is taking pricing down.","And also, maybe trends on distribution in the U.S. cereal cash growth for you as well. When do you expect that to actually bounce back into positive sales growth? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Steven Cahillane","Thank you, Alexia, I appreciate the question. First, I'd start off by saying as with regards to our Morning Foods business, it's an important business for us and one that we believe can return to growth. And we've demonstrated that by growing 3 of the 4 core cereal markets around the world. We stabilized the business in Canada, in U.K., and Australia around the playbook that focuses on nutrition, on brand building and in-store execution.","These are the things that I've learned in my four months. Our key drivers to the category, they stabilize the business in those three markets and they can do the same thing in the North American market as well.","Having said all that, I'd also remind you though that Morning Foods is not going to be the growth driver for us in the Kellogg Company. We know we can stabilize it, we aim to stabilize it but we look across the world and we see our emerging markets growing the way that they are.","Asia Pacific doing incredibly well, the growth of Parati in Brazil and Mexico back to growth, the U.K. and Europe stabilizing and growing in the second half and the incredible growth driver that is Pringles around the world.","It sets us up for really solid growth. But Morning Foods is a business that we know we can stabilize once again focusing on nutrition, brand building, in-store execution and the right level of investment. And you'll see that coming out of Q4 where we put additional investment behind all of the businesses that I just spoke about and that will continue to the first half of 2018 where we aim to slowly stabilize the business of Morning Foods.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll stick to my one question and pass it on.","Steven Cahillane","Thanks, Alexia.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Good morning.","Steven Cahillane","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Hey. I guess a question around the Snacks business and investment in 2018. Steve, can you talk a little bit about how much of the investment is going behind I guess, increasing like marketing or pull investments? And how much of it in 2018 will go towards -- beginning to expand the snacks footprint into other channels?","Given that it had such a -- sort of such focus on large-format foods. Really trying to understand how much of that investment is brand pull or marketing pull or how much might be reached out distribution into channels where it was underrepresented?","Steven Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks, Bryan. First, I know you're aware of the whole reason why we pulled out of DSD. It was not a good return on investment and we felt -- and I give great credit to the team that pulled this off because it was incredibly complex and it was brave and it was done with great execution.","And it allowed us to put that money back into brand building. Significant pressure against the brands started last year, will continue into this year with the whole model now being a pull model versus the DSD push model focus on the consumer, focus on brand building.","Having said that, there's also innovation coming in different formats that you talked about, more focus on immediate consumption where we believe we have big opportunities. And so, you'll see us doing a lot of innovative things, a lot more brand building things. And it's all -- what's allowed us to do this is the whole DSD exit and the focus on pull and brand building.","So very pleased about where we are, pleased about the investment back into the top line and we believe we'll see good underlying growth based on the execution of the program.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Two questions. One is just on currency. I have thought that you would have a little bit more EPS benefit from currency for the year than what you seem to be intimating here. Is there something happening from across currency standpoint that's -- I guess, contradicting that?","And secondly, Steve, it is great to see Europe, Australia stabilizing. But I guess, over the years we've been trained to -- I guess, not quite trust stabilization in those markets, things happen and I just wanted to know if you have a good sense of why these efforts that have been made more recently have some sustainability to it? And do you believe that the category in those markets is stable? Or is it just like what your business is doing is executing better? Thanks.","Fareed Khan","Robert, it's Fareed. I'll start by just your questions on currency. Obviously, we look at the future just like everybody else. And so, this thing can move around a little bit. But our review in 2018 is that we're going to see modestly positive FX impact on the business and that's what we've given. There's also country mix that factors into their when we look at different parts of our business growing.","And then our primary exposure is to obviously the dollar, the pound, the Canadian dollars and the Mexican peso and so it's really those -- the key currencies that factor into it. But right now, our view is modestly positive for next year is that the percentage point is at 1.5, that's kind of the range that we are in right now. I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steven Cahillane","Yes. Robert, thanks for the question. I'm not going to overpromise and say that nothing's ever going to happen and businesses aren't going to fluctuate and go up and down in competitive environments.","But what I will tell you is what I've seen in those three core markets has been an execution, a solid execution around, what we call here, the playbook and again, its nutrition, brand building, in-store execution and excellence in execution. And I see that in the three markets. And I'll give you some examples of that.","So, for example, in the U.K. Corn Flakes has been a business that's been around for a very, very long time, very mature business and the team there put together a new brand building idea, a program around what we internally call, versatility.","But was really a reintroduction to consumers, to reconsider Corn Flakes in various dayparts and really fun way to talk about in a social media way how people enjoy the perfect bowl of corn flakes. It went viral, it became part of the dialogue, it became contemporary again and Corn Flakes started growing double digits.","And so, to point to things like that and you see things like that, and it fundamentally reinforces to me that this is a business that can grow. The other thing I would tell you is, the hard-pressed to find businesses with household penetration that are almost 100. I mean, getting it into people's pantries is not difficult, it happens.","But getting people excited about it is our job to do. And we can do better in brand building, in the United States and we've got good programs and good ideas that we're bringing forward.","I guess, another thing I'd tell you is it just requires innovation and constant innovation and really pressing ourselves. And if you look at Bear Naked in the U.S. which is now the number one granola brand, it's number one granola brand because it's excellent food, well executed and it\u2019s really connecting with the consumer.","So, it's up to us to really maintain a high standard of these things and execute with excellence because it's not easy. It's a competitive category, it does respond when it's marketed too well but if you stumble, you can lose some volume.","So, we're bound and determined to grow the three markets that are stabilized, to stabilize our North American Morning Foods business. But as I said earlier to Alexia, it's also you shouldn't look at U.S. Morning Foods and say this is going to be the growth engine for the Kellogg company. It's all the things that I mentioned earlier around emerging markets, around our Other brands and categories, getting bigger and smacking.","This company over the course of the last five years has really transitioned itself from primarily a cereal business to a much more of an innovative snacking business. And the latest acquisition of RXBAR is just kind of a cherry on top.","That's a business that filled the white space for us and it's doing incredibly well and really connecting with consumers and growing rapidly. Has outside share based on its ACV distribution.","So, you'll see us invest wisely around where we see the real opportunities to grow this business but we will not starve areas of the business that we know that are important and we'll do it prudently and wisely.","And I believe we can get all four businesses in a good stable position but I come around and again to say it won't always be perfect. In any business that has the type of excellent portfolio spread wide that we do.","They're always going to be errors that are accelerating and are doing well and areas that we're working. We're not always going to have a U.S. Frozen business that's going double digits.","But when we do we'll invest wisely behind it. Try and continue to push that. We'll have to be cognizant of all the different portfolio pieces that we have invest wisely so that we can grow the totality of our business.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Thank you. Steve, if you look at the EBIT margin including the change in pension accounting I would argue it's a little bit toward the lower side of the peer group depending on who you're including in that.","Can you talk a bit and I know it\u2019s still early days for you and maybe haven't done this full analysis yet but as you look down the road how much of a margin opportunity do you see and if you do see one where might some of those opportunities come from?","Steven Cahillane","Yeah, ken, thanks for the question. I do see opportunities to continue to expand our margin. But the important thing that I see is it\u2019s an end thing. We'll have to continue to expand our margins and we have to grow our top line by continued smart brand building investment.","Currently our index versus our peers is higher in brand building. So that's one of the reasons where a little bit lower on the operating profit margin. But having said that, we clearly have an opportunity to continue to expand our margin and you'll see us to get towards continued top line growth, continued margin expansion.","The best way that I see it expanding our margins is continuing the great discipline that is happening around this company around cost containment and cost reduction.","You've seen that in Project K, you've seen that in ZBB, you've seen that in Zero overhead growth, will all which has led to the 250-basis point improvement that Fareed talk about and will continue into this year allowing us to achieve that 350 basis points but that's not a finish line.","It's not a finish line so we'll continue to expand our margin but the best way to do it again is to maintain a good cost discipline and to grow the top line. And do those both types of things.","When you get into a nice algorithm that historically we've seen in this business and we believe we can get there and it will be by focusing on both of those things. Top line growth and cost containment leading to good margin expansion.","Ken Goldman","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Rainey with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.","Tim Rainey","Thanks so much. Steve, your background is considerably different than Mini and Kellogg. And I didn't really get into kind of strategic use of capital. I know you're not going to in response to the question but is something we expect you to discuss at CAGNY in a more full way?","Steven Cahillane","Thanks for the question, Tim. We're going to discuss at CAGNY a much more wholesome strategic view where we see the company going over the course of the next three-plus years and beyond to include many things. What we promise here today is to talk about 2018 guidance which we've done and then at CAGNY we'll be talking about the more strategic questions that you raised.","Tim Rainey","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Steven Cahillane","Good morning.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask about the reinvestments. It's a bit of fourth quarter question here and a bit of a 2018 question. The snack business I think the original projection was 17% margin by 2019. You hit that number in the fourth quarter here so clearly an delivery EPS comes in a little bit ahead of consensus.","In a lot of places, you so you reinvested. Is it correct to say that snacks fairly substantially over delivered and then the company chose to take that over delivery and reinvest it across the business in the fourth quarter? And then in 2018 can you give us some quantification of the size of this reinvestment. Thank you.","Fareed Khan","Sure David, its Fareed. We did have a strong Q4 snacks definitely have a strong quarter. We did have other businesses that had very strong results as well. The snacks success is really the successful execution against the DSD exit we've been talking about that for several quarters.","But the key elements of that fell right into place and we're starting to benefit from the overall savings that are pulling through. There's always a plan to invest back in snacks brand building as you recall we actually pull back in some of those investments in Q2 and Q3 to just sort keep promotional activity stable.","So, we're probably light on the investments back into those key snacks brands. That came on as planned in Q4. Those will continue and so we're back at it and we're actually seeing our velocities and we are seeing some of those brands come back which is encouraging.","On top of that because of the strong performance we did additional investments in very targeted areas so we look across the different opportunities we have some beers solid ROI metrics.","And we look across opportunities and we probably have somewhere in the order of $50 million year-over-year a lift in brand building in Q4, which is pretty meaningful but we're on track for our strong full year delivery and we're pleased with the outcomes.","As we look into 2018, what we want to do is make sure that we got fuel in the first couple quarters to continue to build on that momentum. And so, as you think about Q1 and Q2 what you see there is a sort of our run rate incremental brand building investment like we see in Q4.","And again, for sure in snacks because that's always the plan we're also taking a pretty targeted look in other businesses, it's not just North American and around the world. That's why in the phasing we want you to consider heavy incremental brand building Q1, Q2.","And then going back more to a normalized phase then we'll see how the year progresses. Obviously, if the brands are responding we'll continue to keep the pressure. But we like what we see so far.","David Driscoll","So, it sounds like the narrative is pretty straightforward. You guys are exceeding your plan. You're taking some of that over delivery reinvested it got to continue into 2018.","I think that's what you just said. Steve maybe you can comment on your nonorganic revenue forecast I think minus 1% to minus 2% just connect the dots for us when we're all this reinvestment it sounds great.","When you listen to the organic revenue forecast it still weak. Minus 1% to minus 2% is it just very conservative on your all start or do you just think it takes that much time before we can actually get back to something positive?","Steven Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks, David. I point out a couple of things. We still have the headwind of the DSD exit which continues into the first of which is worth about a point.","We'll look at the underlying really to be flat to minus 1%. I wouldn't call it conservative I'll call it prudent. I think it\u2019s right down the middle. We've got RXBAR which led a 1% to 2%. So, we're trying to get this business, talking about growth, focused on growth and clearly, we are investing in growth.","Now having said that, I see a lot of opportunities around the world and in North America already growing we've got Asia Pacific, we've got Pringles globally, U.S. Frozen which I mentioned which is really hitting on all cylinders right now U.S. Specialty with 10 quarters of solid growth.","And then the emerging markets which are very exciting to us with stabilization in CARICOM good momentum in Parati opportunity to expand snacks in Asia. And so, I get to the point of your question you say all of those things and say, that sounds exciting why not the more aggressive growth forecast.","We're going to shoot to grow better than that but we think it's better to be prudent but we're going to shoot to do better than that. And as Fareed said we've invested in the fourth quarter we like what we see coming out of that investment.","We're going to put continued pressure in the marketplace if you talk what Fareed to talk about in the fourth quarter and you carried that through 2018, we'll have at least $100 million of additional brand building pressure in the marketplace.","And I'd love to be in a position where we're talking about exceeding our net sales goals. But right now, we think it\u2019s just smart to be prudent since it's still early.","David Driscoll","I really appreciate the depth of your answer. Thank you.","Steven Cahillane","Thank you, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about gross margin. I guess Fareed I know you talked about some of the puts and takes continued impact from rebasing the margin structure and snacks and then some benefits from pricing.","But can you give us any more quantified view of the gross margin outlook off of whatever the restated basis ultimately going to be both on the underlying basis so you want to be taken into account of the DSD exit.","And I guess, just in terms of other specifics just any commentary you can give us in the impact of freight costs and how that's reflected in the outlook.","Steven Cahillane","Sure. So, let's take gross margins and for the moment peel away the effect of the DSD dynamics. What we want to see is stable to slightly improving margins and that's going to come from continuing to innovate and drive products that are mix accretive but a big part of that is the efficiency programs that we drive every day.","What we do expect to see logistics inflation would be a factor some of the commodities that go into our products, we see inflationary some are the other way. But the most important thing is we've got ongoing productivity and cost savings initiatives and addressing those and so we see gross margins up to flattish as we go into next year.","Then when you overlay the DSD there's a mechanical effect of the price adjustments and there's also a geography impact where the DSD model all of those delivery warehouse related costs go through overhead some of those now flow throughout cost of goods.","So, you factored that out but what you get to a stable to slightly improving gross margin and that's primarily driven by productivity offsetting those inflation factors I talked about.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. And just a follow-up on the last piece. To the impact of higher freight costs, obviously that's something you can offset for the productivity and the cost savings. But how severe of a discrete headwind is that?","Fareed Khan","So, it\u2019s a factor. With combination of driver shortages and regulation changes, it's something I think that everybody is facing. So, it\u2019s something that we need to manage. So, logistics specifically, we saw the double-digit types of increases in Q4. We expect to see high single-digits as we go into 2018.","How that plays out over the longer-term it will be difficult to watch. But it's back to really looking at our network and continue to make sure that we've got the most efficient network. And part of the DSD logic again was to get all our businesses in one platform and that creates the basis for continuing to optimize and to move forward. But I think in the near term, logistics will be a challenge for everybody.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Thanks for the color, Fareed. Appreciated it.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Thank you. Good morning.","Steven Cahillane","Good morning.","Michael Lavery","As you think about brand spending or investments. How do you determine what the optimal level is? And is it benchmarking against peers or a percentage of sales or just some of what your history has been. How do you factor all that in and what drives you think about what the right increases are?","Steven Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Michael. I can tell you what I found when I came in was a very good and sophisticated marketing mix model with good ROI measurements. And so, you kind of start there in terms of understanding what you can get for your investment. But there's nothing like a great idea, well executed that builds equity and drives consumer interests, drives trial, drives repeat.","And so, there's no one model that will tell you where you get to the point of diminishing returns, but great ideas well-funded can do wonders for brands and we've seen that and we continue to see that here.","Having said that, there's also minimal requirements for brands that are important part of our stable that we make sure that we don't slavishly just chase where the best ROI's are, but we're also prudent and we give solid brands enough support so that we don't have a tail that we have to address down the road.","So, there's a lot of science to it, but there's still some art to it. 25 years ago, it was 80% art and maybe 90% art and 10% science. Now you're probably 70% science, the rest judgment, wisdom, experience and art. And we're trying to put all those things into place as we build plans and then you adjust those plans as you say exactly was happening and what return you're getting and what's moving the needle.","Michael Lavery","And do you have a commensurate increase in R&D for the innovation to put the marketing dollars behind? How do you \u2013 are those coupled at all and how do you think about that bucket of spending?","Steven Cahillane","Well, it's an important bucket of spend and be very focused on innovation, and you'll see us bringing things in the back half of this year and into 2019 that we're working out accelerating right now that come right out of our R&D group, working together with our business units. We've got a terrific R&D facility here, it's inspiring to go through.","I've been very impressed by the capability that we have and so it\u2019s clearly in there as I look around that's worthy of investment, but it's got to be completely joined up with the rest of the businesses. And I think from an efficiency standpoint, we can probably do even more with what we have currently.","As we look at the model it doesn't all have to be in-sourced, it comes through partnerships, it comes through activities like our 1829 investments, it comes from even acquisitions, RXBAR brought tremendous amount of new thinking and innovative thinking and entrepreneurial flair to the company.","So, we look at it holistically. But we are excited when we see the opportunity to put a $100 million of additional pressure behind our brands over a kind of a rolling 12-month basis.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic","Thanks, good morning. It's a philosophical question, but Coca-Cola Company where you were before does a great job in terms of persuading people in emerging markets to drink soft drinks.","And do you really see the potential in emerging markets and cultures where cereal is not part of a local habit or culture for Kellogg to really build that business over time, or is your focus going to be more on developing the snacks business in the emerging markets, and not emphasize cereal as much?","That's the first question and second one just related to that, when you bought RXBAR you talk about pivoting to growth through acquisitions. That was my interpretation at that time. Does that mean that at some point we've seen coffee companies like soft drink companies, we've seen coffee companies, pet food companies, does that mean that Kellogg at some point as it pivots to growth that it will look at other categories also? Thank you.","Steven Cahillane","Yeah, Pablo, thanks for the question. First on the cereal in emerging markets, I see a real opportunity to actually develop that in many markets. But it's an end thing, our bigger opportunity, I mean, as we have a huge opportunity with Pringles and snacks around the world.","I was in Nigeria just a couple of weeks ago, we've just launched cereal there and that was very exciting to watch. It was very exciting to be with the team as they were going through the plans and actually launching the product.","So, we see good opportunities. Affordable, it's healthy; it hits on a lot of trends around health and wellness, around megatrends of emerging markets and growing middle classes. In many ways, just a perfect addition to diets and lifestyles in many emerging markets but it's an end thing because we have a big opportunity with snacks in emerging markets as well.","And the other thing I'd tell you \u2013 answer your question around acquisitions, I want to be very clear, they're great opportunities as we look around the world to do acquisitions like RXBAR, where we see a white space in our own company and we see the right opportunity at the right price and we have to be very, very disciplined buyers as it pertains to M&A.","But the single biggest opportunity I see is actually organic growth both in our North American business but in our out of America North America business, our emerging market business and our Europe business.","So, we've got great opportunity with this wonderful stable of brands that we have. To grow them through focusing on the right brand building activities and again leaning forward and investing in the brands what you're seeing us do with this $100 million of rolling 12-month pressure against them.","And we believe there's great portfolio of brands can grow, not every single one and not every single geography, but on balance we can get an algorithm of growth that really works for us and then we can look at bolt-on acquisitions like RXBAR as an accompaniment to that. And so that's the way I kind of see our portfolio and I think it\u2019s very exciting. And so, thanks for the question.","John Renwick","Unfortunately, we've hit 10:30. So we're going to have to finish the call here. I'm around all day, if you have any other follow-up questions but thanks for your time and interest.

Welcome to the Kellogg Company's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. Thank you. At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Kellogg Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Emily, and good morning, and thanks to everybody else for joining us today for a review of our first quarter 2014 results. I'm joined by John Bryant, President and CEO; and Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer.","The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. And as you're aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, May 8. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. And I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased to announce first quarter results that were broadly in line with our expectations. Operating profit was in line with guidance and earnings per share were ahead of guidance. Our sales growth was lower than expected, primarily due to ongoing weakness in our large developed cereal businesses. However, we continue to see strong results from Pringles and we are building momentum in our U.S. Snacks business.","Project K, our 4-year efficiency and effectiveness program continues to go well. You will have seen some of the announcements we made during the quarter and we are on track to hit our targets for the project in 2014. The execution by the team has been very good and we're pleased with the progress we've made so far. And we're reaffirming our guidance for the full year, while recognizing the impact of the difficult operating environment in some of our categories. As you'll remember, we were always expecting improved results in the second half of the year as we haven't begun the brand-building investment tied to Project K yet. In 2014, this will include investment in category building activities in developed markets around the world and also in additional in-store capabilities in our U.S. Snacks business. This investment will begin in the second quarter and will build over time, as will the benefits. Ron will give you some more color on our guidance in a few minutes.","And now if you'll turn to Slide 4, we'll spend a couple of minutes discussing our progress on Project K. The project remains on track and we continue to execute well. Last quarter, we updated you on some of the announcements we've made so far. As you know, we've announced plans to close or reduce capacity at various facilities in developed markets. In addition, we've also announced increased supply chain capacity investment in a number of emerging markets. Since then, we've announced progress with the implementation of global business services. We've announced plans to implement a 3-tiered model, which will include local, regional and global services. As part of this, in the third quarter, we plan to open the first regional center, which will support North America. GBS is an important part of Project K and is a major undertaking for the organization. And Project K itself will drive significant changes. It will allow us to build key capabilities, create the supply chain we need to service our global business as it evolves and generate the savings necessary to improve results and drive future growth. Some of these decisions are very difficult ones to make but they are necessary to drive long-term growth.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows the first quarter's financial results. Internal sales declined by 2.4% in the quarter, although we saw improvement in March and this continued into April. The decline in sales was primarily driven by developed cereal markets and the elasticity impact of pricing related to the food tax in Mexico. On the positive side, we saw strong growth in Pringles in each region across the globe, improving trends in our U.S. Snacks business and solid growth across Asia.","Underlying internal operating profit decreased by 5.5%, which was broadly in line with our expectations. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by our sales performance and the timing of costs and savings within cost of goods sold across the year. It's worth noting that the first quarter's underlying operating margin was approximately equal to the level we expect for the full year. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments and Project K costs were $1.01 per share in the first quarter, which was ahead of our expectations due to the timing of a below the line benefit of $0.03 per share. Without this, earnings per share would have been $0.98, at the high end of our guidance. Reported earnings per share for the quarter were $1.12, including $0.01 of Pringles integration costs, $0.10 of upfront cost relates to Project K and a $0.22 benefit from mark-to-market adjustments.","Slide 6 shows the composition of the first quarter sales growth. As I mentioned, total internal sales declined by 2.4%. We saw a total price and mix improvements of 1.1 points in the quarter with North America, Europe and Latin America, all posting good growth. Volume decreased by 3.5% in the first quarter as declines in developed cereal and in Mexico were key contributors. Unit volume declined at a slower rate as a reduction in the weight of products impacted by volume by around 1 point. We expect improving trends in volume and continued positive price mix as we progress through the year, driven by strong commercial programs and investment in our categories. Finally, the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales growth by 0.7% in the quarter, primarily as a result of movement in the Canadian and Australian dollars.","Now, let's look at Slide 7, which shows our underlying reported gross profit for the quarter. Our underlying gross margin increased by 10 basis points in the quarter with improvement in price mix more than covering a slight inflationary position in cost of goods. This was due to the timing of both costs and savings across the year. Our cost inflation is a little more front-end weighted and the productivity we expect to get this year from Project K is more back-end loaded. Our initiatives are on track and we have good visibility to our cost structure over the balance of the year. We are currently covered on commodities and packaging at around 80%, which is in line with previous levels of coverage at this time of the year.","Slide 8 shows the quarterly internal operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's internal operating profit decreased by 6%. Lower sales in cereal are a key contributor but the timing of cost and savings I mentioned earlier were a key factor in this region. We also saw some effect from weather in the quarter which impacted production and distribution. We expect improvement in the second half of the year in North America as sales and productivity improve and as we recognize some of the savings from Project K.","Internal operating profit in Europe was flat in the first quarter as the impact of the decline in sales and slightly higher brand building was offset by cost of goods performance and some pricing impact. Internal operating profit grew 9% in Latin America. Pricing and productivity helped drive an increase in gross margin and the timing of investment in brand building also helped the business more than offset the lower sales posted in the quarter. Like many in the industry, we saw a volume impact from the tax increase in Mexico. And Asia Pacific posted a decrease in internal operating profit of 27% in the quarter. This was largely due to cereal sales declines in Australia and investments in India related to brand building and the new plant we are preparing to start up in 2014.","Slide 9 shows cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $268 million and this was in line with our plan. The accounts payable initiative, supplier financing, is also progressing according to plan. So our full year expectations for cash flow have not changed. Capital spending in the quarter was $97 million, comparable to prior year and we continue to expect that we will invest between 4% and 5% of sales for the full year. So free cash flow was $171 million, on track to meet our expectations for between $1 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. And finally, share repurchases this quarter were $321 million, consistent with our plan to return cash to our shareowners and we still expect to reduce our average share count by between 1.5 and 2 points over the course of the year.","Now let's turn to Slide 10, which shows our guidance for 2014. And as you can see, we are reaffirming the initial guidance we provided last quarter. We still expect that internal net sales will increase by approximately 1% for the full year. This excludes integration costs, currency translation and this year's 53rd week. While we saw softer sales performance in our developed cereal markets in the first quarter, we have stronger commercial plans and category-driving investment over the remainder of the year, with key programs starting in the second quarter. We expect our global business's internal sales to return to growth beginning in the second quarter. We continue to expect moderate material-related inflation and that total cost of goods inflation will be between 3% and 4%.","Productivity and savings from Project K ramp up as we move through the year and should more than offset this inflation. And as a result, we continue to expect moderate net deflation for the year and still expect full year gross margin to increase by 40 to 50 basis points. We anticipate that underlying internal operating profit will be in a range from flat to up 2% and brand building should increase at a rate greater than sales growth. Of course, this excludes the 53rd week, which will add between 1.5 and 2 points to reported operating profit growth.","Currency-neutral comparable earnings are expected to increase by between 1% and 3% or to $3.89 to $3.97 per share. The 53rd week will add approximately $0.08 per share, resulting in currency-neutral earnings per share including the 53rd week of $3.97 to $4.05, which we believe is in line with the latest consensus estimates on Bloomberg. The tax rate is still expected to be between 29% and 30% and interest expense is anticipated to be between $215 million and $225 million.","Slide 11 is an earnings per share block and is the same one we showed you last quarter. Based on the latest spot rates, we continue to estimate the currency translation will not have an impact on our results. This excludes any potential impact from a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And just to put it into perspective, Venezuela has traditionally been about 1% of total company sales and approximately 2% of total company operating profit on a full year basis. Our estimate for integration costs remains at $0.07 to $0.09 per share and Project K upfront costs are still expected to be between $0.60 and $0.65 per share.","Now let's turn to Slide 12 and some final comments on guidance for the year. Cash flow is expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. And as I mentioned previously, capital spending will be between 4% and 5% of sales, so it is 1% higher than our normal long-term guidance due to the investments related to Project K.","I'd also like to provide some color regarding the second quarter. We expect that we will return to top line growth, but we expect underlying internal operating profit to be down slightly as a result of a significant increase in our investment in brand building. We expect comparable currency-neutral earnings to be approximately in line with last year's results of $1.02 per share.","And now, I'll turn it back over to John for more detail on the operatings.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Now, let's look at Slide 13 and some more detail regarding Morning Foods. Sales declined by 5.5% in the quarter, which was a disappointing start to the year. Obviously, we faced some challenges in the cereal category in the U.S. but we've also faced specific issues with Special K, Mini-Wheats and Kashi. However, where we focus activity, we've seen better results. The good growth I mentioned last quarter in Raisin Bran and Raisin Bran Crunch continued this quarter. Both brands posted high-single digit consumption growth as our health related messaging continued to appeal to consumers. So for 2014, we expect category consumption to continue to decline, but at a moderating rate. And while we expect our consumption to remain down over the remainder of the year, we do expect it to be more in line with category trends.","We are very committed to the cereal category. Let me talk more about what we're planning to do. First, we've got more activity planned for the second quarter of this year, including the beginning of our category building programs. In fact, we're planning a high-single digit increase in investment in brand building in Q2, followed by continued growth in Q3. We will focus our investment on the Desire, Decide, Delight framework that we highlighted last quarter and at the CAGNY conference. The category relevancy work we have planned will highlight the nutritional benefits of cereal and milk and will also remind consumers that cereal is a healthy way to satisfy cravings for a late-night snack.","Secondly, we've also got significant brand-specific activity planned, including a mix of support and innovation, particularly for the 3 brands I mentioned. We've got a new program for Special K called Simple 5 that highlights that consumers can lose up to 5 pounds in 2 weeks, which includes Special K products from across our portfolio. We've got more non-GMO verified Kashi products scheduled for innovation, print introduction and we're strengthening our brand-building program on Mini-Wheats, which will highlight the brand's nutritious and delicious positioning. This program will incorporate TV ads, print, digital and social media and of course, will be tied into the broader category relevance work.","And also as part of Desire, Decide, Delight, we will be investing to improve our in-store execution. All of this is just a small part of each of these initiatives, but hopefully you can see that we've got a lot of activity planned. We've identified the problems, we're taking actions and most importantly, we believe that this activity will drive better category results and better performance of our brands. And finally, for Morning Foods, our Pop-Tarts brand posted growth again in the quarter and gained almost 1 point of share. We know improved performance in the cereal business will take some time and we're committed to these categories and are confident they will drive future growth.","Now let's turn to Slide 14 and our U.S. Snacks segment. Internal net sales growth was 0.3%. As I mentioned, we've had good merchandising in the Snacks business in the first quarter. We are pleased with the overall results, especially the performance we saw later in the quarter. The cracker business posted consumption growth of 2.7% in Q1 and we gained over 1 point of share. Innovation drove the Cheez-It brand as the White Cheddar variety and Cheez-It Zings and Grooves all contributed. In addition, original Cheez-It posted mid-single digit gains in consumption in the quarter.","The TownHouse brand also continued to do well as both the core, original variety and new TownHouse Pita posted growth in consumption. And we also posted sales growth in the cookie business as we saw improved execution and in-store activity. The Keebler brand in total posted low-single digit growth in consumption due primarily to growth in the Fudge Shoppe and Sandies brands. Consumption for the Chips Deluxe brand declined due to lower incremental activity, but we saw very good initial results from the recent launch of 2 varieties co-branded with M&Ms. And we didn't begin activity until late in the quarter.","In the Wholesome Snacks business, Rice Krispies treats again gained share and Nutri-Grain gained share and posted increased consumption as a result of Nutri-Grain Crunch. However, these good results were more than offset by weakness in Special K and FiberPlus. We have recently launched innovation planned to address this, including 2 new Special K protein bars. With FiberPlus, we are repositioning the brand around meaningful consumer benefits in addition to fiber, including protein, calcium and Omega-3. So we weren't pleased with the results in the Wholesome Snacks business in the first quarter, but we expect performance to improve over time.","The Pringles business posted high-single digit growth in consumption and internal net sales growth. The 3 versions of Tortilla Pringles that we launched late last year have done very well. The initial strong rates of trial appear to have led to good rates of repeat and we are pleased with the success of this innovation and we've only launched this idea in the U.S. so far. Pringles is a brand with a lot of potential, both in the U.S. and around the world and we have a strong calendar of events planned for execution this year. So the snacks business had a better first quarter. We've started to see improved results and the in-store activities that we've begun have been successful. The entire team is working hard across the portfolio. We've got good plans and we're happy with the initial reaction to the actions we've taken so far. As a result, we remain on track to deliver full year top and bottom line growth.","Now let's look at Slide 15 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Internal net sales declined 1.7%, which was impacted by Foodservice trends, resulting from adverse weather in the quarter. As you've heard from other companies, this affected much of the industry, including sales to restaurants, businesses and schools due to closings. However, it does seem that industry trends improved toward the end of the quarter. We gained share in the Convenience channel in the health and wellness and cracker categories with Special K and Cheez-It driving the performance in crackers. And Pringles also did well again this quarter and was the fastest-growing brand in the salty snack segment of the Convenience channel over the 52-week period through the end of March. New Pringles Tortillas is getting good placement and the early sales rates are encouraging.","Slide 16 shows detail regarding the North America Other segment. This segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses posted an internal sales decline of 2.1% in the first quarter, although this was lapping a high-single digit comp from last year. Internal net sales in the Frozen Foods business decreased in the quarter. We were lapping strong double-digit growth in the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of the introduction of Special K flatbread sandwiches late in 2012. The overall waffle category posted a slight decline in consumption in Q1, although our Kids segment did well as both Wafflers at new Eggo Bites contributed. In addition, we expect distribution gains over the balance of the year and full year growth.","And like last quarter, we posted double-digit growth in the burger segment of our Morningstar Farms business. We posted low-single digit internal sales growth in Canada in the quarter. The snacks business were driven by Kashi and Nutri-Grain innovation, and Pop-Tarts also did well. Pringles achieved double-digit sales growth as a result of good activity, distribution gains and strong in-store execution. We gained a small amount of cereal share in the quarter, driven by good performance in the kid and all-family segments.","Now let's turn to Slide 17 in our European business. Internal net sales in the European business declined by 1.7% in the quarter, lapping 3% growth last year. We continued to see lower rates of cereal consumption in developed markets in the quarter and we were lapping the impact of the launch of new products last year, including Special K Cracker Crisps and other snacks in various parts of the region. We saw good cereal volume growth in emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East and Turkey. We saw better performance later in the quarter in some developed markets, such as France, although the cereal business in most developed markets continued to be difficult. However, just like everyone in the Kellogg Company, we are absolutely committed to the cereal business in Europe and we have plans for a significant increase in investment over the course of the next few quarters. This will involve category-building initiatives that highlight the health benefits of good, simple, tasty and wholesome food.","The Pringles business in Europe also posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And we've got strong activity planned for Pringles across the region as we are launching a broad-based soccer-themed event in Q2 and other programs later in the year. And also in snacks, you'll remember that we launched handheld breakfast products in various parts of the region last year, which continue to do well, posting double-digit growth in the first quarter. So the environment remains difficult in Europe. And as a result, we expect that full year sales growth will be approximately flat this year. However, we do have a lot of activity planned and we're making the right decisions now for growth in the future.","Slide 18 shows the first quarter sales growth for the Latin American region. Internal net sales declined by 5.3%, lapping high-single-digit growth in the first quarter of last year. The food and drink tax that went into effect in Mexico at the start of the year had an impact on sales growth as we mentioned. However, results were in line with our expectations and the team has maintained a strong focus on innovation and in-store excellence. For example, we gained more than 2 points of share in the Mexican wholesome snacks business in the latest 12-week data, as a result of good consumption growth in various brands, including Special K and Nutri-Grain, driven by the success of Fruittella. So we expect that the impact from the tax will continue this year but that the elasticity that we saw in Q1 will decline progressively as consumers adjust to the new prices.","Our Latin America business has moved to a regional category model for both cereal and snacks and this has facilitated increased investment in both brand building and innovation. We have plans to increase significantly our investment in brand building in the region over the next couple of quarters. The team has already begun some Kellogg parent brand category-building activity and we're seeing a good early response. Across the rest of the region, we gained share in many of our Wholesome Snack and Savory Snacks businesses and we saw good sales growth in Brazil in both cereal and snacks.","The Pringles business continued to do very well, posting high-single digit sales growth in the quarter and we expect continued strong results from the brand as a result of new commercial plans and additional brand building, including soccer-related activity planned for the summer. So we do expect good sales growth from the region over the remainder of the year, although results will continue to be impacted by the situation in Mexico and the uncertainty that remains in Venezuela.","Now let's turn to Slide 19 and detail on the Asia-Pacific business. This segment posted an internal sales decline of 1.4%. This was driven primarily by the Australian business as the Asian business posted high-single digit growth in the quarter. Specifically, we saw good growth in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. The Japanese business was driven by the continued growth of granola and importantly, the Southeast Asian business benefited from a category building activity we started recently in the region. And the Pringles business in the region posted high-single digit growth as expansion into India and new listings expanded our footprint. In Australia, the cereal category saw mid-single digit declines in consumption in the period, although performance improved later in the quarter. We have category-building activity that will drive this business going into the market into Q2 and we have a significant increase in investment planned for both Q2 and Q3. Separately, the Chinese joint venture also posted strong results. So overall performance was good in the Asian business. Although results in Australia were lower-than-expected, we have plans in place to improve the relevancy of the category and specifically, the performance of Kellogg's brands.","Let's turn to Slide 20 and the summary. We are pleased that results for the first quarter were largely as we expected. Sales weakness in developed categories in regions continued, but we saw good growth elsewhere and we saw signs of improvement in our U.S. Snacks business. As you know, late last year, we announced Project K, a 4-year efficiency and effectiveness program, the largest in the company's history. And I'm pleased to say that the project is going very well. We've made good progress on GBS and supply chain with strong execution. And we've also made great progress developing the ideas that will drive sales growth in the future. We're excited about the potential we have and you're going to hear much more about these initiatives in the months to come. We are on track for the year and have reaffirmed guidance.","As I said last quarter, this is a journey and some of the decisions we've made have been difficult. However, Project K and the significant amount of investment we will make in the business over the next 4 years are the right things to do. They will improve our supply chain network, build key capabilities, cut costs and fuel the investment that will drive sales growth. None of this would be possible without our Kellogg employees and I'd like to end by thanking them for all their hard work and commitment.","And now, let's open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, I know it's probably a bit early to have a real sense of success of the category building work that you're just starting to do. But I guess since you started talking about the master brand plan, try to go back and look maybe into some other food companies that have attempted something maybe sort of similar in the past. And I guess it is tough to find ones that have been particularly successful, though I'm sure I don't have a complete list by any means. So I guess my question is, maybe what is it that's different about this time for you guys, maybe because I'm sure your folks know, obviously, all the pitfalls that have plagued maybe, others that have tried a similar sort of process?","John A. Bryant","Andrew, I think the thing to keep in mind in what we're doing here with the Kellogg parent brand, is that we are providing additional investment to the portfolio. So the money coming in to support the parent brand is actually additional money that we've been spending on cereal. So all of the brand-specific programs are still in place. So if we were moving a tremendous amount of money from brand-specific activities to category level activities, I think that would be a risky move. This is more, as we invest back into the business, we're investing back in a way that we believe will have the greatest impact. When we look at what's happening in cereal today, there's really 2 elements if you look at our business. One is around category relevance, the category down around 4% to 5%, and then there's some Kellogg-specific issues that we have. As we look at that category relevance work, look what's happening within the occasion, the breakfast occasion is actually growing, household penetration is high for cereal, but the issue is that consumers are seeking protein and they're not taking into account that milk and cereal is a great source of protein because of the milk and often, some of the cereal, some of the grains also have a good amount of protein in them as well. So we really, with this parent brand, rather than moving money from the sub-brands up to the parent brand, we're activating it with new investment money, we're talking about the benefits of protein that comes from cereal and milk, which is very much on track with the customer today and it's also very much aligned with what the milk board is talking about as well. So I think there's an opportunity here for additional synergies as we look across all the activities that are happening in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, at least in measured channels, one of the bigger tailwinds to your cereal business had been positive changes in distribution points. That trend lately, again just in Nielsen, right, has turned into a headwind with TBT [ph] I guess, starting to trend down a little bit. So couple things. First, is that representative of what's actually happening out there or is there something in that data we should be aware of? And second, if it is representative, I'm just curious if you could help us understand what's underlying some of those trends?","John A. Bryant","And just on that, can you really focus in on cereal in your question?","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, thanks, John.","John A. Bryant","Okay. Well, if we look at the cereal, entire cereal aisle is not changing all that much in terms of size. I think within our business, we've got a couple businesses that have struggled a little bit of late and we have lost a little bit of distribution in. So the one business I guess I'd point to that has been impacted by that has been Kashi. Kashi remains an incredibly strong brand, it's actually one of the largest brands in the natural organic space. And what we're doing there is we're bringing out new food that's more in line with the progressive nutrition that people are looking for from brands like Kashi. And so you're seeing GMO-free type SKUs come into the market now, as well as longer term, some innovation to ensure that we are in the area of pioneering health. So as you look at our complete points of distribution across the cereal aisle, it's come down a little bit, not dramatically and we have an expectation that we can continue to grow our distribution over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a question about Mexico. Can you talk a little bit about the -- how the -- not just the de-elasticities in the first quarter, but have you seen consumers switch from products that were taxed to products that weren't taxed? And I guess what I'm after is, I know in soft drinks it appeared as though there was some trade across out of some of the sugared or taxed beverages into things like water or other types of flavored beverages. So have you seen that type of switching in consumer behavior in Mexico? And then second, just I wanted to make clear or make sure I understood, in terms of pricing in Mexico, was your pricing -- did you take price increases above the -- in addition to the rate increase that -- or the tax increase that the consumers saw in the shelf?","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Bryan. If you look at our business in Mexico, most of our portfolio actually fell underneath the impact of that tax, so we didn't see a lot of switching within our portfolio and that's true also at a broad category level. We did see an impact from the tax, obviously, and that impact was exactly in line with what we expected. To your question, we also did take a price increase at the same time, so the impact only was slightly higher than just the tax in isolation. As we look at Latin America as a reporting segment, we do expect it to return to growth in the second quarter. We do expect seeing the elasticities moderate over time as consumers get used to that pricing impact. The other thing that is impacting our Latin American business a little bit in the first quarter is actually Venezuela. Venezuela sales are actually down in Q1. That's in part because we were unable to fully ship in P3, but we were able to ship in P4. And so we had some catch up shipments occur in P4. So there's a little bit of a Q1, Q2 shipped occurring there as well. We actually feel good about the Mexican business. We feel like it is tracking right where we expect it to, given the tax impact and the price increase. And in fact, in the marketplace, as I said in the prepared remarks, even gaining some share in the wholesome snacks area.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Will there be more brand building that goes into Mexico in the balance of the year, now that the price is on the shelf?","John A. Bryant","Yes, absolutely, Bryan. We, in the prepared remarks commented that there'd be additional brand building across Q2 and Q3 in Latin America and that will certainly also be the case in Mexico.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, I do remember you talking about kind of a tactical strategy for the master brand approach and talking about the benefits of milk and cereal together and the protein it provides at CAGNY. But I guess, one of the concerns I had was that consumers appear to be drinking less milk, as well as eating less cereal. And I wanted to know, in the testing that you've done, are you hearing any kind of consumer feedback about consumer demand for milk declining on health concerns? And then secondly, I think you also said that you might try to go up against Greek yogurt and do kind of comparisons there in the advertising, is that still part of the plan?","John A. Bryant","As we look at the category building programs, there's actually 3 or 4 different executions within that program. One of those executions is reminding consumers of the benefit of protein that comes with cereal and milk. And we believe that absolutely resonates with consumers. It's actually a surprise to consumers that when you look at the protein that's in, say, a bowl of Mini-Wheats and milk, that's there's as much protein there as in many yogurts. So that is a positive surprise to people, so an opportunity to reappraise and reconsider cereal and milk. That's not the only activation, though. As you pointed out, there is a little bit of a trend against milk out there and so we also activate programs with the soymilk suppliers and so on and other alternatively ways with which people consume cereal. And rather than think about cereal going up against yogurt, it's also worth remembering that cereal is actually a complement to yogurt and that a lot of people add cereal to their yogurt as well. But that's not the only execution of our parent brand or category of driving activity. We also have a cereal snacking program, recognizing that the incidence of snacking on cereal has increased significantly over the last decade, from 20% of all cereal consumed outside the breakfast occasion, nearly of 30% of all cereal outside the breakfast occasion. And historically, we've seen good success with those programs on brands like Special K in evening snacking. So we have those sorts of programs coming back into the market. And then there are other programs that remind people of the simplicity of the food; that this is food directly from the farm to the table, that a cornflake is virtually a corn grit that's being rolled and toasted. So it's not -- as you think about the category relevance work, it's not all just a milk and grain story, it's actually several different executions around the world that we will be able to work with through Q2, Q3, get responses from, adapt, adopt and quickly take up what's working and move it around the system.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Sloane of Societe Generale.","Alex Sloane - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","I was hoping to get some more color on the like-for-like sales decline in Asia. Appreciate Australia was the key factor there. Just wondering, is the weakness in Australia entirely a cereal issue or has Pringles also been held back? And with the actions you're taking in Australia, do you think you can get or do you think you can post positive internal net sales growth in Asia-Pacific for the full year? And I guess, while we're on Asia, it's around about 18 months since the announcement of your JV with Wilmar in China. So just wondering if you could give a very brief overview on how that JV is progressing relative to your expectations?","John A. Bryant","So within Asia-Pacific, we actually saw very good growth in Asia. As I said before in the prepared remarks, Japan, Southeast Asia, all these -- a number of these markets grew quite strongly in the first quarter. Unfortunately, it was held back by Australia in the first quarter. We're lapping last year in Australia where we launched the breakfast beverage business that had some big volume comparisons coming from that launch. As we look at the Australian cereal category, it has similar dynamics to what we've seen, say, in the U.S. and we have very significant investment going in the brand building behind the Australian cereal business in the second and third quarter, as well as large consumer promotion events in each of the next 3 quarters. So we do expect an improvement in the Australian cereal business. And while we don't normally give guidance at a segment level, we do expect Asia Pacific to have positive growth across the year. On Pringles specifically, actually, Pringles in Australia grew quite nicely and Pringles in the region also grew, despite some foreign exchange headwind as we take Pringles, say, from U.S. into Japan. And obviously, the cost of goods goes up as the exchange rate has moved. If there's one thing I would say about Asia-Pacific, it's we have seen a slowdown in India. That's probably the one area that's a little bit slower than we would have expected to see. Still growing, but not at the extremely high rates that we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years. But we feel good about the state of the Asia-Pacific business and the long-term potential. On China, that's a relatively small joint venture, early days. Having said that, we virtually doubled the business in the first quarter but it's not consolidated in our results. So there's no benefit from the China joint venture sales within the internal sales number that we report for Asia-Pacific.","Operator","Our next question is from David Hayes of Nomura.","David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","My one question is just around the advertising expenditure and the phasing of that. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color, at least directionally maybe, in terms of the expenditure levels in the potential sales in the first quarter versus year-on-year and sequentially. And then I think you mentioned obviously, this build up through the year. I just wonder whether you can give us some feeling as whether that's going to be very heavy in second and third quarter and falling away in the fourth or building up through the year? And then related to that investment, again, obviously you're talking about being ready for this category push in the second quarter, a lot of that is around, as we understand it, direct store and merchandising in-store. Can you talk about any activities, any investment that you've made in the first quarter to put more salespeople in place, et cetera, which are ready to go as we go into the second quarter?","John A. Bryant","I'll ask Ron to answer the advertising phasing question. I'll come back and talk about the feet on the street investment.","Ronald L. Dissinger","So in terms of the advertising, our total brand building phasing pressure across the year. First, we had good pressure in the first quarter, but our brand building was down slightly year-over-year. Our pressure is much stronger, particularly in the second quarter and the third quarter. So we're looking to be up, probably mid- to high-single digits in terms of our brand building pressure. And then as we said for the full year, we expect our brand building and advertising to grow at a rate faster than sales growth, but good pressure out there in the second quarter and the third quarter.","John A. Bryant","If we look at the investment back in the sales organization, it's really happened in 2 places in the U.S. The first one is in our DSD system. We've invested back in the DSD organization by increasing the number of reps and we've improved the technology available to those reps as well. So we're seeing a very good performance from our DSD sales organization. We'll start to see that come through in the first quarter. We're building momentum and through the 4 big businesses within snacks, we gained over 1share point in crackers, with growth from Cheez-It, Club, from basin [ph] innovation, Town House, the core cracker brands. We also saw very good growth in cookies towards the end of the quarter with the M&M cookies coming through. Now, all this is coming through in terms of improved execution in store. Our wholesome snacks is the one business that is not firing on all cylinders. Within that, we have a couple of brands that are doing well and a few that need some work, but we're seeing improved merchandising there over time as well. And of course, Pringles continues to deliver double-digit growth in the first quarter on top of double-digit growth last year. So we're seeing a good response to investment of sales organization on DSD. The other part of the sales organization that we are looking to continue to optimize is on the Morning Foods or cereal side of the business, the warehouse side, where we have more of a broken model and we are selectively adding back Kellogg direct employees feet on the street there in the right locations where we have the greatest impact. That's more later in Q1 into Q2 as we go through the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. Just first one, Ron, you mentioned on Slide 11 about Venezuela and I think you said it had no \u2013 there's no FX impact or you haven't assumed any. Can you just -- are you -- have you not adjusted your CCAD rate or were you just talking x currency? And if we include currency, how much of a drag is Venezuela expected to be on the range?","Ronald L. Dissinger","So at this point in time, Eric, we have not taken a devaluation for the Venezuela business. Let me just elaborate on that a little bit. First, as I said in the prepared remarks, sales are approximately 1% of our total company sales and operating profit is approximately 2% of our company operating profit. The valuation of our net assets and the translation of sales and profits are really a facts and circumstances situation. Within Venezuela, Kellogg's is deemed a priority industry. And we manufacture virtually all of our product domestically within Venezuela. We were also able to secure funds for anything we buy out of the country to produce in the country. We're able to secure funds at the official rate of VEF 6.3 to the U.S. dollar. So at this point in time, we have chosen to continue to value our business at that rate. Now the CCAD 1 rate, I believe, is just under VEF 11 to the U.S. dollar. If our facts and circumstances were to change and we were to value at that rate, we would have a one-time charge impact for the devaluation of the net assets and then we would have an impact from the future translation of profits to our business. The estimated impact for that, and this will be disclosed within our Q as well, is around $0.09 to $0.11 of earnings per share.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. So you're -- because I guess, you have production locally and you're deemed by their government to be special or that's why you're different from other companies that have had to recognize the 11 rate?","Ronald L. Dissinger","That is absolutely correct, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, John, if I could follow up. The Nielsen data going into the quarter showed your cookies and crackers business as struggling a bit, but you kind of pointed to it actually being quite strong, I think if my memory's correct, crackers are really the bulk of the business and the most profitable part. Can you talk a little bit about the difference between the Nielsen data and your shipments? And also, kind of how you see the Project K kind of enabling that business when obviously, your competitor in Mondelez has a lot kind of riding on their North American business, both being stronger in terms of sales and profits and they're taking production down to Mexico, et cetera?","John A. Bryant","Well, Eric, I feel very good about the momentum that we are building in our snacks business in the U.S. and we had a tough year last year. But as I look within the U.S. and what probably not as evident when all you see is the quarterly results is when you look at the phasing within the quarter, we came out of Q1 strong. And we're seeing very good momentum behind crackers and cookies, Pringles, obviously as well. And in that business, it's not really the ability to have a big disconnect between consumption and shipments over time because it's a DSD business, it's not going to a warehouse where you could get inventory hung up for a period of time. So a couple reasons why our shipments were stronger than our consumption. One is we had some activity going in customer that is outside the measured data. And also, we had very good display levels at the end of the quarter on full and seeing that pull out in P4 consumption as well. So I believe we are building momentum in the snacks business and thought we're absolutely on the right track. In terms of our competitor, I can't really talk to what their strategy or their intent is. But our intent here is to play our game, which is innovation-driven, in-store execution driven, invest back in the sales organization. We've gained share in crackers for just about every year for the last 10, 12 years, except for the last 1 or 2 years. And to see ourselves back in cracker share growth there, you see the Keebler business growing low-single digits, you see Pringles driving double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth, there's a lot of reasons here to see the business start to turn. Wholesome snacks, there's still work to be done but we're absolutely addressing it and taking the right actions.","Operator","Our next question is from David Driscoll of Citi Research.","Alexis Borden - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Alexis Borden in for David this morning. Just a question about kind of your inflation expectations. I know you reiterated your guidance of 3% to 4% and you said that deflation was modest in the first quarter. So can maybe you kind of clarify or elaborate a little bit of the pacing on a go-forward basis?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. So we did see a little bit of net inflation within the first quarter. We still expect, as I said, around 3% to 4% of cost inflation and that will be more than offset by the productivity improvements that we expect over the course of the year. Remember, we've always talked about inflationary costs in materials, and primarily that being driven by our packaging costs. We did see some timing of cost and savings, as I said, within our factories, in particular, timing of production. Our production was a little bit lower in the first quarter, not an issue for the full year, necessarily. But a little lower in the first quarter and some of that was related to the weather impact that John talked about, we all actually saw some impact to our ability to produce in some of our manufacturing facilities. So our inflation is a little bit more front-end weighted, not a significant exaggeration, though, in terms of front end versus how it spreads across the year. The other important thing is our savings. We have good savings in the first quarter, but those savings ramp-up as we progress through the balance of the year. And the Project K savings are a particular contributor to that. Those savings, as you can imagine, particularly for our supply chain initiatives, will increase as we go through particularly the back part of the year. So we will see or have seen the net inflation in the first quarter and we'll see some net deflation over the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First, a follow-up question. After your conversation with Eric there with regard to shipments versus consumption, do you think your shipments overall were in line with consumption across your businesses? And second, my primary question is, we've been talking about your investments in brand building in the quarter and I think, while we're assuming that the bulk of that is going to be U.S. cereal, perhaps you can confirm on that and with regard specifically to advertising behind that. Given that, I thought it was interesting, you said you expected cereal to be down, but down in line with the category. Given your importance in the category, are you expecting that the category growth or decline rate will improve through the rest of this year?","John A. Bryant","Okay. So there's a few questions in there. Firstly, in terms of any difference between shipments and consumption, I would say that our shipments were broadly in line with our consumption. And if we look at our trade inventory levels, there was nothing there that stuck out on us as a concern year-on-year. Secondly, in terms of brand building investment, the brand building investment we have coming in Q2 and Q3 is a little bit more cereal-oriented, particularly in some of the developed markets such as parts of Europe, Australia, U.S. Obviously, we continue to invest more in brands like Pringles as well, which has continued to drive tremendous growth for us. I'm trying to remember the third piece now, that you asked me.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just the part about brand building and the fact that you said that you expected decline to continue. Given this investment, it seems rather conservative.","John A. Bryant","Well, I believe that the category growth is a function of what the manufacturers do. So to your point, if we improve our performance, then the category performance should improve as well. And in some respects, that is inside of expectation. In the first quarter, the category's down 4% to 5%. The category's likely to be down more sort of low-single digits across the back half of the year with us more in line with the category. Not necessarily in line with the category, but closer to the category. And if we can improve our performance, I believe the category will improve.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Grainger, Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to focus more on the non-GMO Kashi offerings and just any early thoughts you have on the performance there. Can you give us a sense at all of the cost benefit trade-offs, whether there's a material difference in margin, how retailers are responding to it and if you have any observations about performance at the consumer level relative to the, I guess, legacy SKUs?","John A. Bryant","Well, firstly, as I said earlier, Kashi is a tremendous brand. It's one of the largest brands in the natural organic space. We do need to invest more back into the food to ensure we're on track with progressive nutrition. And as we do that, it means putting money back into the food itself. So it does impact the gross margin structure but essentially, the shift within Kashi from brand building into the food because you have to have the food right. In terms of are we seeing an impact, it's too early to say there's a big impact from GMO-free. We do have organic SKUs within Kashi and they've been doing well. So I think there's reason to believe in there. But ultimately, we need to get more new innovation to the marketplace over time. So we're confident in the long-term growth of Kashi. What I will say is, this business, because it has lost some distribution over the last 12, 18 months, it is going to be a headwind as we go through 2014 as we're just lapping those distribution losses. But long term, this is a very strong business. We just need to get it back on track and invest more in the food because that's what consumers are looking for from this brand.","Operator","And our last question will come from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You mentioned that there were also some problems with Special K and Mini-Wheats, as well and it would be great to get some detail on that. You mentioned distribution losses at Kashi. Was that specifically in regular grocery stores, was it in the natural grocery outlets? And more broadly, because the cereal category as a whole has been in trouble for I guess, about 18 months now, how are the retailers thinking about shelf space allocations to the entire segment at the moment?","John A. Bryant","Okay. Well, perhaps I could take that in reverse order that you asked the questions. But again, the retail support for the category remains strong. This is one of the largest, most profitable categories within the retail environment and the discussions we're having with retailers are very productive and positive about how we grow our combined business. And in some respects, you come back to the category relevance work, we're getting very good retail support from network because it's helping retailers both with the cereal category and with the milk category, which is another important category for them over time as well. So we continue to get good retail support for shelf assortment. There's probably a little bit less merchandising support over the last couple of years but can get good primary shelf support. In terms of where the distribution losses have occurred for Kashi, quite frankly, there have been some retailers that are more mainstream in orientation that probably took a little bit more Kashi than they could sustain in that sort of outlet and we're still seeing very good distribution in the primary stores where the natural organic shopper goes to shop. And then coming back to your first question about some of the other brands where we have some challenges, we have Special K and Mini-Wheats, we have specific activity coming to market against both of those. So on Mini-Wheats, it's on air here in the second quarter. It's also being heavily featured in the category work that's going on. And on Special K, we have a new Simple 5 program that's coming in the second quarter, which actually is a portfolio program across cereals, snacks and frozen and really highlights the all-day weight management partner that Special K is. And so we have a number of specific programs addressing those very specific brand opportunities, which we think are part of the solution to drive back to growth.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And on Special K, was there a reason that the sort of the beginning of the year typical campaign on dieting and so on didn't work as well this year or is it a different issue?","John A. Bryant","I think we have a couple of opportunities with Special K. Certainly, the resolution event earlier this year was not as effective as we would have liked and I think we have an opportunity to continue to improve those programs over time. I think they've become -- we used to call them the 2-week challenge. It's become a challenge, it's become something difficult to do. It's not resonating with consumers as well and so we need to continue to move the brand to a more positive footing of great food that helps you live your life to the fullest and manage your weight as opposed to more of a negative orientation. And quite frankly, that's a challenge not just in the U.S., it's a global challenge on Special K. If you look around the world where the weakness is in some of our other cereal business, it is a Special K discussion. And so as we look at our Special K programs globally, we are working on different programs around the world. We've changed food in a number of markets and as we see again what works, we'll continue to adapt and adopt rapidly around the Kellogg system and bring those ideas to bear.","Ronald L.

The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","And now, I'll turn it over to Steve and slide number 3.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with how our 2018 is going. Our top-line performance is clearly improving. If you exclude the mechanical impact of our DSD exit, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. And our in-market performance is improving as well.","We delivered on our financial expectations for Q2 and the first half, even as we significantly boosted brand building investment and managed through cost inflation and other challenges. More importantly, our progress toward returning to long-term sustainable growth continued.","Firstly, our big brands are back in growth. Pringles is growing across the globe in the United States, in Europe, in Latin America and in Asia Pacific. Other snack brands, like Cheez-It and Rice Krispies Treats, have sustained strong consumption growth, even in the aftermath of our transition out of DSD. Brands like Bear Naked and RXBAR continue to expand.","Frozen Foods brands, Eggo and Morningstar Farms, continue to grow consumption, even as they lap last year's strong acceleration. Around the world, we're growing brands like Coco Pops, Froot Loops, Crunchy Nut and Krave, all through effective brand building activity. Even Special K and Kashi Cereals, which had been down sharply in recent years, are making strong improvements in their consumption and share trends.","Second, we're investing for the future. We increased our advertising and consumer promotion, what we call brand building, at a double-digit rate again in Q2, just as we said we would. This investment, along with investments we are making in new pack formats, speaks to the quality of our earnings and to how serious we are about getting our brands back in sustainable growth.","Meanwhile, we also invested cash in our pension funds, making a voluntary contribution to mitigate potential risk in the future and to take advantage of a changing corporate tax rate this year.","And we're integrating and executing well on recent acquisitions, including RX and our newly consolidated West Africa business. Both of these entities improve the growth profile of our portfolio. And thirdly, we're increasing our full year 2018 sales and earnings guidance.","It's gratifying to see our top-line come in better than anticipated in the first half, giving us the ability to reinvest in the business and still deliver strong earnings growth, even before the tax benefits of U.S. tax reform and pension contribution.","It's also gratifying to see our acquisitions performing well right out of the gate, giving us new platforms for future growth. We know we've got a lot of work yet to do, but Q1 and Q2 results, as well as our full year guidance, should give you confidence that we're on the right track.","Let me now turn it over to Fareed, who will walk you through the specifics of our Q2 and our first half financials. Fareed?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 4 summarizes our results for the second quarter. It was another good quarter, characterized by improving consumption and sales trends, as well as the substantial reinvestment that began back in Q4 of 2017. Our net sales, obviously, got a lift from our RX acquisition and recent consolidation of Multipro, our West Africa distributor. And both of these businesses sustained their strong growth rates in Q2. We also realized organic growth outside the negative and mechanical impact of the DSD exit. And I'll come back to this in the moment.","We had signaled a few months ago that operating profit would be down year-on-year in Q2, excluding the acquisition impact of newly consolidated Multipro. This was because of our plans to significantly increase our brand building and we did exactly that. It leaves our OP at a low single-digit growth for the first half, which is when our brand investment is the most heavily weighted this year.","And on EPS, we posted another quarter of double-digit growth. Higher interest expense related to our recent acquisitions was more than offset by tax rate favorability. Most of this was due to U.S. tax reform, but we also recorded some additional favorability related to making a voluntary cash contribution to our pension funds, taking advantage of being able to deduct at the higher pre-reform U.S. corporate tax rate.","I should note that we continue to deliver on cash flow. We're comparing against a year ago that was recast for accounting changes, reclassifying certain cash collections to a different section of the cash flow statement. But even excluding that reclassification, our cash flow has been strong enough to enable us to make a $250 million voluntary pension contribution. And excluding both of these items, to be more apples-to-apples, our cash flow is up year-on-year through Q2. So we like where we stand midway through the year. Let's examine the results in a little bit more detail.","Slide 5 walks you through the components of net sales growth in the quarter and the first half. Excluding currency, our net sales grew more than 6% year-on-year. Two acquisitions contributed almost 7 points of growth. We began consolidating Multipro in May, giving us two months of its results in our second quarter. That business continues to grow at a strong double-digit rate. The other acquisition, of course, was RX, which was acquired in October of last year. It, too, continues to post strong double-digit growth in the quarter.","On an organic basis, our sales were off slightly year-on-year in the second quarter, leaving us up slightly for the first half. Keep in mind that for the first half, this organic growth was pulled down by about 2 percentage points by the mechanical impact of last year's DSD exit, specifically the rationalization of SKUs and the elimination of the price premium we used to charge for DSD services.","As discussed previously, this impact was a larger negative in Q2 than Q1, solely because of the very different year-on-year comparisons. So if we strip this DSD impact out, we've now posted 2% organic growth in both the first and second quarters. This gives us four consecutive quarters of underlying organic growth on this basis. It's an indication that our strategy is gaining traction.","Let's turn to our profit margins, starting with gross margin on slide 6. It's helpful to break our gross margin decline into three buckets. Let's start with the first bucket, which is the mechanical impacts of our DSD exit and the consolidation of Multipro. The DSD impact, we've discussed many times, but as a reminder, it's effectively a reset of our gross margins in U.S. Snacks related to our exit from DSD. This includes the downward adjustment to our selling price to reflect no longer charging for DSD services and the shift between line items on the P&L. Specifically, there's the movement of logistics out of SG&A, where they reside in DSD accounting, and into cost of goods, where logistics costs reside in warehouse distribution. These factors mostly anniversaried at the end of July here in Q3.","The impact of consolidating Multipro was new this quarter. As a distributor, Multipro carries a lower gross margin than the rest of our business. We're more than okay with that because it's not cannibalistic to our base business and owning a distributor is a significant competitive advantage for us in emerging markets like West Africa. It also drives strong dollar growth.","And remember, within our West Africa investments, we also own a stake in a branded manufacturer and joint ventures for Kellogg branded products. These carry strong packaged food margins, but only the distributor portion is currently consolidated into our results. We'll have this mechanical impact from including Multipro for three more quarters.","The second bucket is growth-related. By growing our volume, we did see some positive gross margin impact from operating leverage. However, this acceleration in volume also participated in an acceleration in mix shifts that negatively impact our gross margin percentage, a mix shift towards emerging markets, for example, and away from developed markets cereal.","We also experienced a mix shift towards single-serve formats. Now, given their price-pack architecture, you'd expect these single-serve items to be margin accretive, but we've utilized co-packers for many of them in order to get to the market as quickly as possible. This is a smart way to go. And now that demand has been established, our supply chain can catch up to our investing capacity, which will improve margins going forward.","These various mix shifts mainly reflect where our business is coming from, where growth is coming from. We've been leaning into them for top-line growth. Not only is it working, but these shifts haven't been cannibalistic. In-all, a big impact in Q2, but less going forward, and we're addressing some longer-term profitability opportunities within many of these mix shifts.","Meanwhile, there is also a contribution to mix from a year-ago promotional comparisons that will be behind us in the second half. For instance, promotional activity is back to normal for Pringles Europe. And U.S. Snacks will start to lap its own pullback in promotions last year.","The final bucket is ongoing, our costs versus our productivity. The surge in transportation costs has been well documented. We've also seen an increase in inflation for many other cost inputs. We're managing through these. And in Q2, like Q1, we were able to largely offset their impact on margin with our productivity savings. But as this inflation moves higher, we're obviously going to go further on savings programs and on Revenue Growth Management in order to offset it.","Bottom line, there's some good reasons for the year-on-year decrease in our gross profit margin percentage in Q2. We'll lap the DSD impact here in Q3 and the Multipro impact in a few quarters and our mix impact related to our growing businesses and we'll have some supply chain solutions for this. That leaves ongoing cost inflation, where we'll continue to manage through with productivity and Revenue Growth Management initiatives.","Our operating profit margin is shown on slide 7. Operating profit margin decreased year-on-year in Q2, principally reflecting a strong double-digit investment in brand building. This is a third straight quarter of double-digit increases in brand building. A large portion of this increase was in U.S. Snacks, where our exit from DSD has effectively traded declining ROI overhead for higher ROI brand investment.","We've also increased brand building at double digit rates in several other businesses and regions. And while we're investing more, we're also being very selective about where and how we are investing. Clearly, it's already having a positive impact on our top-line performance and we'll continue to lean into reinvesting, where appropriate.","Masked by this increase in brand building is a sharp reduction in overhead, mainly related to the DSD exit, but also reflecting good cost disciplines and Project K savings.","So Q2 was a quality quarter, marked by improving top-line and heavy reinvestment for future growth and even overcoming unexpected headwinds, like the trucker strike in Brazil. This gives us good confidence in our full year outlook.","In fact, as shown on slide 8, we are raising the key elements of our financial guidance for the year. We're raising our guidance for currency neutral net sales, now looking for growth of 4% to 5% year-on-year. We still expect acquisitions, RXBAR and Multipro, to account for 4 to 6 percentage points of growth and both are performing very well.","Organic sales are now expected be flat to down 1%, an improvement of about a percentage point from our previous guidance. Driving this improvement is essentially our first half over-delivery and we continue to take a prudent view towards our second half, especially given the tougher comps we face in European Pringles, U.S. Frozen Foods, and U.S. Snacks, excluding the DSD exit.","We should note that the negative DSD impact, which weighs down our organic growth, is largely behind us by mid-Q3. We are reaffirming our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth of 5% to 7% on a currency neutral basis. Less than half of this growth comes from acquisitions, whose outlook is unchanged. The rest of the gain comes from our underlying business, even after a strong increase in brand investment. To some degree, our decision to leave operating profit unchanged is related to our first half mix impact, but it also reflects our desire to maintain the opportunity to reinvest more.","We're raising our guidance for currency neutral adjusted earnings per share, adding a couple of percentage points to give us a new range of 11% to 13% off a recast 2017 EPS base of $4.00 per share. This increase in EPS guidance is because we are reducing our outlook for tax rate to about 18% to 19%, reflecting Q2's tax benefit from our voluntary pension contribution.","While our underlying cash generation remains on track, the pension contribution does lead to a reduction in our cash flow outlook. This is an investment that not only offers a tax benefit for us this year, but also reduces pension risk over time, so it's a good use of cash.","Separately, we're also increasing our capital expenditure plan for the year by almost $50 million to fund promising growth initiatives, such as capacity for single-serve pack formats and for emerging markets. These are high return investments. In summary, a good second quarter that leaves us in a strong financial shape as we head into the second half.","As you think about the split between Q3 and Q4, keep in mind two important factors. Q3 not only compares against our strongest profit performance last year, a strong double-digit gain, but we also have brand investments to Q3 that was not previously in our plan. So Q3's operating profit may be flattish, while Q4 should be up strongly as it laps last year's sizable ramp-up in brand building.","And with that, let me turn it back over to Steve to walk through our businesses.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Fareed. Let's start with U.S. Snacks, which is shown on slide number 9. The first thing to note is that we remain ahead of plan on net sales. Yes, Q2's decline was larger than Q1's, but remember that Q1 and Q2 had decidedly different year-ago comparisons on DSD impact. As Fareed mentioned, Q1 compared against a small year-ago net disruption, while Q2 compared against a small year-ago net benefit from pipeline fill. We're actually ahead of where we thought we'd be and we've now recorded four straight quarters of year-on-year growth, excluding this DSD impact.","We're also pleased with where we are from a consumption standpoint. Across all our categories, we saw another quarter of increased velocities, which we've always said would be our lead indicator of improved competitiveness as we get through the initial 12 months of transition.","And as the slide shows, we are also improving our share performance in each category. Pringles sustained its strong growth in Q2, led by our core flavors and immediate consumption pack formats. In wholesome snacks, we recorded another quarter of double-digit consumption growth, led by Rice Krispies Treats and driven by innovation and advertising so effective that we are presently constrained on capacity.","In crackers, we moved into year-on-year consumption growth in Q2, led by accelerated growth in our biggest brand, Cheez-It. And we're seeing improvement in cookies performance as well, with consumption growth in newly supported brands like Keebler Fudge Shoppe, Mother's and Famous Amos. Meanwhile, our operating profit growth and operating profit margin expansion continued in Q2, even amidst substantially increased levels of investment, so another good quarter.","So we're delivering on what we promised when we exited DSD. We've got a stronger line-up on-shelf after weeding out tail SKUs and we're seeing improved velocities as a result. Our brands are significantly better supported today. We can now afford to more fully support power brands like Pringles, Cheez-It, and Rice Krispies Treats. And we can afford, for the first time in years, to support other key brands in our portfolio, brands like Keebler Fudge Shoppe, Nutri-Grain and Special K Bars.","In recent months, we have embarked on the final phase of the project, creating a single retail sales force across our U.S. Snacks and U.S. Morning Foods divisions. This single retail force will be less encumbered by driving time, enabling more time in stores, and it will leverage the benefits of scale. In short, one year after the DSD exit, U.S. Snacks remains right on track financially and with a business that is now more competitive, generating improved top-line growth and it is more profitable than ever.","Now, let's turn to U.S. Morning Foods in slide number 10. Morning Foods' performance in Q2 was similar to Q1. Profit was down, as expected, due, in large part, to increased investment, negative operating leverage and among its tougher comparisons of the year. Net sales decreased at a similar pace as Q1, continuing its moderation this year from last year's decline.","But behind these numbers is real progress. Our share of the cereal category stabilized with our Core 6 cereal brands collectively resuming share growth in the quarter. The cereal category has cut its declines in half from last year, but history shows that it needs more and better health and wellness innovation and communication to get back into growth.","We've been busy in this area and we're pleased with our early progress. Special K continued to grow consumption and share in the quarter, as we tout its inner strength positioning. Raisin Bran returned to consumption and share growth as we launched new food, Raisin Bran Crunch with Bananas, and supported it with advertising that highlights Raisin Bran's health attributes. Similarly, Mini-Wheats stabilized its share in the quarter, with new food and communication that emphasizes its satiety and fiber. We also made some headway in the taste fun segment, with both Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops increasing consumption and share, both aided by innovation that is driving base consumption.","Looking ahead to the second half, our outlook for Morning Foods has not changed. We still expect to see profit pressured by increased investment this year, but with a continuing moderation in sales declines as we work toward stabilizing this business. We've got a strong pipeline of innovation and solid plans for brand building and in-store activity. We like the way our brands are starting to respond. There's still more work to do across more of our brands, but we're on the right track.","Turning to slide number 11, U.S. Specialty Channels continues to post top-line growth reliably. We recorded growth in most of our channels. Vending was up strongly, as was Girl Scouts. And convenience was up solidly in the quarter as well. Their performance was only partially offset by a modest decline in our sales to foodservice, driven by K-12 schools and military, but offset by growth in commercial restaurants and other channels.","Importantly, we continue to compete well, with share gains in more than half of our biggest categories in each of our major channels. As we have told you on previous earnings calls, Specialty Channels' operating profit in 2018 is forecast to be uncharacteristically down year-on-year, due to changes we made this year in the allocation of costs from other U.S. segments. This is not related to any change in the underlying business, which remain solid.","We have strong plans for the second half, and we expect 2018 to be another year of dependable performance from Specialty Channels, though we do now have to lap last year's unusually strong FEMA orders during the major hurricanes of late Q3 and early Q4.","Let's turn to slide number 12 and our North America Other segment. This segment turned in another quarter of exceptional net sales and operating profit growth, sustaining its performance from Q1. Obviously, the acquisition and rapid growth of RX accounts for most of this net sales growth. In Q2, like Q1, its net sales were up significantly and consumption continued to rise sharply, as we expand distribution within existing and new channels. We've been modifying our Kids bars line and launched a new line of Nut Butters.","We continue to see the benefits of maintaining RX's independence and entrepreneurial approach as well as the benefits of RX's access to Kellogg's considerable resources. We'll leverage this new growth platform more and more in the future.","In our Frozen Foods business, we continued to post solid sales and consumption growth, even as we started to lap last year's sharp acceleration late in the quarter. Eggo gained share, aided by the successful relaunch of our Thick & Fluffy sub-line. And Morningstar Farms also continued to gain share, sustaining double-digit consumption growth behind its core grilling items. Frozen foods are on trend and we have strong brands and solid commercial plans to continue to grow, even as we face tougher comps in the second half.","Elsewhere in North America Other, our Kashi business is steadily improving its performance. Its cereal consumption continues to outpace the category in the natural channel and it is growing consumption and share in the traditional measured channels as well. Bear Naked Granola sustained its strong momentum, but this quarter it was joined by the Kashi brand, which returned to consumption growth. In Canada, we posted growth in sales and gained share and most of our categories. Overall, we expect continued growth for North America Other, led by RX's continued expansion and Frozen Foods growth, even as we start to lap tougher comparisons in the second half.","So that rounds out Kellogg North America. As you can see on slide number 13, we truly are seeing improved top-line performance in North America; more work to do, of course, but certainly heading in the right direction.","Now let's move to our international businesses, starting with Europe on slide number 14. Europe had a solid quarter, marked by strong top-line growth and higher operating profit, in spite of a very large increase in brand investment. Pringles, again, led the way, continuing to rebound from last year's disruption of normal promotions in some markets and even growing at a high single-digit rate versus the same quarter of two years ago.","Notable in the quarter was media and strong execution of in-store activity around soccer, which provided strong impressions and consumption uplift. Our cereal trends continue on an improved track from last year. Key to this, of course, has been the stabilization of our UK cereal business, which gained share again in Q2.","Importantly, we have meaningfully improved the performance of Special K across the region, with share stable and even growing again in certain markets. Once again, emerging markets were a driver of the Europe region's net sales growth for both cereal and snacks. This was led by Egypt, Russia, and the Middle East. So Europe is in good shape as we go into the second half. Markets remain challenging, particularly in Continental Europe. And we do face tougher comps in the second half on Pringles, but we have gotten key elements of our business stabilized and we've built momentum in others. We feel good about the year for Europe.","Let's turn to Latin America on slide number 15. Latin America's net sales growth accelerated in Q2, despite the trucking strike in Brazil, which essentially halted shipments for close to two weeks. The good news is that shipments have recovered there, but more impressively, in spite of this disruption, we still grew net sales in Brazil in Q2. Parati continued to grow consumption in share in cookies and crackers in Brazil. And we continue to post double-digit growth for Pringles, both in Brazil and elsewhere in our Mercosur sub-region.","Meanwhile, we experience continued momentum in Mexico, our largest market. For Mexico, this marked a ninth straight quarter of year-on-year net sales growth, even accelerating this quarter. Our consumption and share gains accelerated in cereal and we generated good snacks growth, led by Pringles.","We also continued to see good recovery in our Caribbean Central America unit and stabilization in the difficult Colombia market. Aiding our growth acceleration, but holding back operating profit in the quarter, was a substantial increase in brand building investment. We also incurred meaningful one-off costs related to disruption from the truckers' strike in Brazil. We feel good about how our Latin America business is trending. Top-line growth and consumption growth is solid. And we expect to see better profit performance in the second half.","And finally, let's take a look at our Asia Pacific region, shown on slide 16. This was another very strong quarter for this region. Obviously, our reported results were boosted by the consolidation of Multipro. Not only did this add two months of its total sales, but its underlying growth remains strongly in the double digits. This is a terrific business and it has a long runway of growth.","It should also be mentioned that Dufil, the manufacturing arm of our West Africa business, also had another strong quarter, though its results are not consolidated into our sales and profit. However, even excluding Multipro, which we treat as an acquisition, our organic net sales growth in Asia Pacific was plus 5% in the quarter and it was broad-based across the region.","Emerging markets cereal grew at a high single-digit rate, with double-digit growth in our India business. Pringles continued its strong and consistent growth trajectory, up high single digits in Q2. And Australia grew net sales for the quarter, driven by cereal consumption growth. This growth produced another double-digit gain in operating profit, even on an organic basis and despite increased brand building investment. So Asia Pacific is firing on all cylinders right now.","Slide number 17 offers a summary of our top-line performance by our three international regions. Don't lose sight of the growing importance of our international regions and the strong growth they're now generating. Within this international growth, we've got momentum and further opportunity for Pringles. We're expanding in granola in all three regions. We're launching wholesome snacks in Asia. And we've stabilized cereal in core markets like the UK and Australia.","And within this international growth, we've got emerging markets growing at a high single-digit rate organically, with growth in both cereal and snacks. And this emerging markets' growth doesn't even include our West Africa business, which itself grew organically at a strong double-digit clip. So we see continued growth to come for these international regions.","So allow me to summarize with slide number 18. We feel very good about the progress we've made this year, and the results plainly reflect this progress. Our portfolio is more growth-oriented today and we're seeing strong contributions from newly acquired RX in North America and newly consolidated Multipro in Nigeria. Both are strong double-digit growers today and growth platforms for many years ahead.","Our top-line growth is improving, both on a reported and on an organic basis. It's improving in North America and growing year-on-year, if you exclude the impact of the DSD exit. And we're solidly in growth in all three of our international regions. Hence, we're raising our full year guidance for net sales.","Our in-market performance is improving. We've restored strong growth in Pringles around the world. We're improving our velocities in post-DSD U.S. Snacks and showing share gains on supported brands. We've stabilized each of our developed cereal markets, including slowing our declines in the U.S. and we've stabilized our biggest global cereal brand, Special K. Meanwhile, we've sustained strong consumption growth in our Frozen Foods' categories.","Driving this enhanced competitiveness are better commercial ideas supported by another quarter of double-digit increases in our advertising and consumer promotion investment. This investment is working because of the caliber of the ideas and the strength of our execution. And we've got more consumer excitement coming in the second half.","Even as we lean into growth, we're reaffirming our guidance for operating profit growth. We're also raising our earnings guidance. This is the result of taking advantage of changing tax rates and making a pension contribution that reduces risk and raises returns going forward. We're delivering strong double-digit earnings growth, even in a year in which we are ramping up investment, so a good first half with strong plans for the second half.","We're firmly on track toward achieving the balance we strive for over time, the sustainable balance between top-line growth and margin expansion that can deliver attractive and consistent total shareowner returns for you.","The success of our Deploy for Growth strategy depends on our people being a competitive advantage. And it is our dedicated employees who are making this progress happen through their hard work and through their creativity.","And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Morning. Thank you.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I was wondering if you could just touch on some of the bigger drivers of your revised higher organic revenue growth outlook. And specifically, maybe touch on two things; one, how much of it is the first half that's behind you versus how much you see in further momentum ahead? And then just specifically as well, Latin America had 13% volume growth. That's the highest I can see in any segment in years and years. Despite the Brazil strike, I know you had the easy comp from a couple things last year, but how sustainable is that? And what should we expect looking ahead there?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll start, and I'll let Fareed build on it. But as I said, we're pleased with our first half performance, right on track to deliver the full year and the full year guidance. As we look at our net sales performance, we are pleased with what's happening in North America with the stabilization of our cereal business, Special K in particular, which if you look back in time, Special K had been a double-digit decliner, and it's back into stabilization in all Core 4 markets. And it's gaining share as well, so that's been very good.","We're going to see RXBAR continue to grow. That'll be part of our organic growth as we get into November and December. Multipro is inorganic, obviously, but across all of our regions we see good, steady performance continuing through the second half.","As you look at each region, there's different comps. So Europe has a more difficult comp coming into the second half. Latin America has a little bit more of a different comp coming into the second half. U.S. Snacks ex-DSD, obviously, that noise is now kind of behind us. So it's a mix of various things that add up to us being confident in being able to deliver the new guidance top-line. Fareed, you want to...?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Sure. Yeah. What I'd add is, again, if you take out the DSD impact and you look at Q1 and Q2, our organic growth rate in both those quarters was right around 2%, and underpinning that is pretty broad-based growth across our whole portfolio.","So Asia, strong growth; Latin America, as you pointed to \u2013 and if you double-click on Latin America, you actually do see strong growth across all the regions there. The recent Parati acquisition that we made in Brazil is still growing double digits. And they've weathered the trucking strike, despite the headwinds that, as you could expect, would come with that.","And then to Steve's point about Europe, in the first half, we were lapping some of the challenges around the price increases we were putting through the market and the retailer disruption. And with that also came a pullback in promotions that are relevant for our year-on-year gross margin comps.","And Europe is coming back strongly. The Pringles business in Europe has had a phenomenal run, helped in part by some good promotions around soccer. And cereal, as we talked about in Q1, we're seeing that business stabilize and very encouraging trends.","And in the U.S., we're in four growth categories. And the R-tech (33:40) category has significantly improved in terms of its sequential consumption performance. And we like what we see in velocities. We like what we're seeing in share growth now across the brands, and these are very broad-based.","So the outlook reflects how we're running, very encouraging signs kind of at the brand level in terms of how we're performing in market. But it's still early days. And I think we're taking a prudent approach to the second half, recognizing some of the tougher comps we'll have in Europe, in U.S. Snacks coming out of DSD. And also our Frozen business has been very strong, really accelerated towards the end of last year, and we factored that into the outlook as well.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Ken.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Hey, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I have one question. What are the key opportunities for you to take pricing to offset some of the higher transportation and freight costs? Can you talk about and give some examples of how you're doing in price-pack architecture, if you're taking list pricing, how you're compensating for the rise in transportation and freight costs? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. I always like say that good suppliers and manufacturers earn price. They don't take price. And we're working very hard to earn price. One of the things we mentioned around kind of the margin compression was single-serve, and so we're driving much more single-serve than we have in the past.","Now, our supply chain has got to catch up to that. So we'll, first and foremost, look to productivity to cover all of our input costs, including transportation inflation and so forth, and Revenue Growth Management to make up the balance of it. And we see good opportunities to continue to do that. Eggo is a good example, Eggo Thick & Fluffy, where we relaunched that line with new packaging, which was much more premium in nature with a new additional food, which was double chocolate. And we got a 12% increase in price and it worked for everybody. It worked for the consumer because they absolutely love the product. It had almost zero elasticity. It worked for the retailer extremely well because it's a higher ring on the same margin for them. It works well for us.","And so those are the types of examples as we think about an inflationary environment, what can we do to add more value to our brands so that we can earn more price in the marketplace? So start with continued productivity to cover as much as we possibly can and earn price on the way back, so that we can continue to expand our margins over time and continue to grow our top-line and strike that right balance.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Oh, yes. Thanks, everyone. Getting to kind of the gross margin, you talked about the gross margin cadence, the adverse mix was an issue in the quarter and you are going to be taking up some CapEx to get some capacity in for what would normally be higher-margin product. Can you give us what that impact could potentially be in terms of recovery of gross margins as that mix starts to improve with some better capacity that can capture that?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Sure. It's Fareed. Thanks for the question. Let me just remind the drivers, because there are sort of three main buckets. The most significant factor in gross margin was the mechanical effective of the DSD and the Multipro, right. And those will cycle through DSD this quarter and then Multipro will have a few more quarters. So that's sort of a mechanical impact that just reflects those areas.","The other thing I'd point out is that again in Q2, we were able to offset pretty significant cost inflation, especially around logistics, but also in other areas through efficiencies and productivity. And so don't read into our margin that somehow we've got sort of crushed by inflation. It is a watch-out going forward, and I think that's where some of the RGM thinking comes into it.","And then you kind of get into the core. And there's a set of things where we pulled back on some promotions last year in Europe because of the price negotiations, as we were working through those. And also in snacks, as we were in the middle of DSD and so lapping those is part of the headwind. And then the other part, as you pointed out, was just mix. And so emerging markets, we're seeing really strong growth and that has an effect.","And the multi-pack and the single-serve, really seeing strong growth there, which is terrific over time because we are under-indexed on those on-the-go formats and so it's a great broader opportunity. It just came much faster than we were expecting, frankly.","And so we had been using third-party co-packers. We had to soft of adjust very quickly from a supply chain perspective and it, frankly, caught us a little bit off guard in terms of having the process optimization, having the automation in our facilities. And we've got investments against that. We're accelerating it. Over time, those'll be margin accretive, as you would expect. Short-term, it's a headwind.","So those are the main factors. And so as we look at our gross margin performance, I think all of these things over time are addressable, some very mechanical, and I think others just from a mix perspective is what we saw in this particular quarter.","Eric J. Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, just to quickly update us, the Project K savings, are they hitting full stride now this year in 2018, or is it 2019 that they actually get full stride with where you don't really have any more reinvestment? Can you just give us a quick cadence on how the Project K winds down and when we get full benefit of that?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Absolutely. I think the headline is that Project K is absolutely delivering against our expectations. And so all the prior guidance we've given around that project is still very much intact. 2018 is the last year of the investments, if you will, whether it's restructuring costs or some of the CapEx that's associated with that. However, we still have some savings that we've talked about half coming in 2018, and a little more than half in 2018, and the remainder coming in 2019.","So we're going to see the upfront costs, the investments finish this year, but we've got another year in 2019 of benefits that we'll wrap. And the most significant item this year was the DSD exit that was part of it, and it was a very significant driver. And you will see that a little bit now, but even more so as we get into the second half of how that is impacting our Snacks business, and the significant reduction in overhead, and then the associated operating profit margin expansion in that business.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted ask about implied guidance for the bottom line in the second half. The comparison's easier, and I know you've talked about tougher top line comparisons, but the EPS, unless I'm reading it wrong on a pro forma basis trend, got a little better, or it gets a little better for you in the back half. So I'm just trying to get a sense, if I had think of the drivers that are preventing the bottom line from being better in the back half, you mentioned a few things. You mentioned FEMA shipments, higher tax, more investments, things like that. I just wanted to get a sense. If you had to order in magnitude some of those, maybe call them, headwinds, could you help us out with that a little bit, just so we understand a little bit why guidance maybe isn't a little bit better for EPS, given that sales guidance was raised?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. So I think part of that, Ken \u2013 it's Fareed \u2013 is, I think, the investments that we've been making on brand building. I think if you go back to the Q4, we talked about putting $50 million in Q4 of incremental investment, and another $50 million over Q1 and Q2, and we've actually put more than that against the business. And the logic is, we're actually seeing the results in-market and feel good about the ROIs and the results that are being generated from that.","I think the mix shifts that we talked about, those we can address over time. In the short-term, it takes a while to get process automation, sort through some of the supply chain. So I think there's some of that tail's going to come into place. And then, you're right about, you mentioned the hurricane laps, as well as some of the tougher comps we talked about in Europe, as well as Snacks, and a little bit in Frozen.","There's a little bit of higher interest expense, as well. We took on some additional debt for RXBAR and the Multipro acquisitions, very manageable levels of debt, but that factors in, as well. And then if you step back, we still want to take a prudent approach, right? We really like what we're seeing in the top line. We've been able to cover inflation with savings initiatives for the first half. But as we look forward, we don't see those pressures abating, and we're probably likely to be more in an inflationary environment.","Now, we've got RGM levers and other things that we'll put against that, but we'll have to see how those play out. So I think those are the factors. And then the Q3, Q4 phasing is really all about the timing of brand building last year versus this year, as the most significant factors.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","And, Ken, if I can just add to that. We're in a good place as we sit here at the half-year margin, and I think Fareed outlined mechanically very well how we think about the back half of the year. But we're here at the half-year able to say that some of our big brands are growing. And they're growing because of this type of investment that we're putting behind them.","And it's a great place to be able to talk about Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Eggo, Morningstar Farms, RX, Bear Naked, Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, all growing, all these are big brands. And on their way, Kashi much better performing than it has been historically, as well as Special K, which was a huge leaky bucket, now stabilized. So we said we wanted to restore and increase brand building investment in order to drive the top line, and we are seeing that happening. So at the half-year, we're taking a prudent approach for the rest of the year, but we like where we are.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you. I was trying to tease out the DSD impact on your pricing in North America. And I think what I get to is that your pricing was flat in North America if we exclude that impact. Is that what we should expect for the rest of the year for North America as well or is there any new pricing that you think you have to put through in order to deal with the higher cost environment?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, Robert, thanks for the question. For competitive reasons, we don't want to give a blueprint to everybody, so we have not been disclosing the impact of price. You can see overall what's happened in terms of the savings coming through. We're not charging for the DSD component anymore, but we're competitive on price and we like where the brands are priced. We like the velocity that we're seeing in the market, and the DSD savings that we had planned are all coming through.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","I'd just add there's pricing considerations in everything that we do, so as we're launching products, as we're thinking about price-pack architecture, as we're thinking about reformulations, all those are opportunities into how we think about it. Rice Krispies Treats with single-serve formats, the Eggo Thick & Fluffy example I think we used in the last quarter, all ways where you can really bring value to consumers and to the channel and, as Steve said, earn it that way.","Now that said, this is something we've got to continue to consider in the context of what's likely to be continued inflationary pressures. And that's absolutely not lost on us and the importance that that could have. So that's about the level of detail we feel comfortable kind of getting into on this call.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Can I ask a follow-up about this mix impact and just like is there a way to quantify what it represents going forward? I mean, how much business are you introducing into the market that's like single-serve, new format business? Is it $100 million, $200 million of business? Is there a way to think of it that way?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","So the first thing I would do is I'd think about the country mix, right, and you think about just the strong growth that we're seeing in emerging markets, and so that's a factor. Other brands that are also growing strongly have an effect. The cereal category is one of our stronger margin businesses.","And then, you get into these more kind of short-term things that we've been facing around just very specific single-serve, multi-pack type of formats, and that's something that's very addressable because, inherently, these are very attractive margin profile types of opportunities. And that's just a matter of kind of aligning our supply chain and fulfillment. And, frankly, that's where we've been seeing a lot of growth, not solely, but that's been a stronger growth area than we have expected.","And the other factor which is going to solve itself over time, too, is just the year-over-year differences in promotional types of investments that hit margin as well, where last year we pulled back in a couple of key businesses for different reasons, but as we lap those, that's a headwind, but those will start to normalize as well.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good morning, everybody.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Morning, David.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Morning.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had one follow-up question and then a question on RX. The follow-up is just on your snack DSD exit. I really appreciate the comments about improvements in velocities on slide 9, but can you translate what that means for sales growth in the back half of the year, Q3 and Q4, now that you've lapped the exit? So that's the follow-up piece.","And then on RX, it's a really interesting business, but can you give us some numerical numbers, some numerical figures on this operation? I think it's $120 million in revenues, maybe growing 30%, but I'm really interested, Steve, where you see this brand going, and are you worried about competition? I think some people have launched similar products. How do you defend the business? And just really curious about your thoughts on the size and opportunity ahead for RX.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. I think in terms of the Snacks business, I think I'd be comfortable if you look at what the category is doing. We should be able to keep up with the category kind of as a basic level to think about. Ex-DSD, we do have some tougher comps coming in the second half, which you'll take note of, but we're through the DSD transition, by and large. I think the team has done an exceptional job at what was a very, very complex undertaking, and we like where the brands are.","We mentioned Rice Krispies Treats is really on fire, and we're having a hard time even keeping up with production of that. And the big brands, Cheez-It, back in growth. Pringles wasn't part of DSD, but Pringles growing nicely. So we like where the brands are, but if you think about just where the category is, we should grow with the category or better as we think about on a long-term go-forward basis.","In terms of RXBAR, RXBAR's consumption is up triple digits. It's a very strong brand. In terms of measured Nielsen share, it's gone up substantially, more than doubling from year-over-year. It's the fastest growth in the category and is doing exceptionally well with consumers and even as it grows distribution.","In terms of competition, whenever you have something that is as special as RXBAR, as successful as RXBAR, you're going to get a lot of me-too's. And we are seeing that happen. We're not seeing any that are gaining traction right now, but we are far, far from complacent.","Peter Rahal and his team are doing just a fantastic job continuing to build loyalty with consumers. They have just a passionate, passionate consumer base. It's a very authentic product. It's seen as real. And it's the first one kind of in this space. And it's always tough as a marketer to come up and copy something and get the same level of authenticity.","So not at all complacent, always thinking about the competitive environment, but driving very, very hard around innovation with: the Kids line, which is out now; the Nut Butter line, which is just launching. And the business continues to show tremendous velocity and great innovation and great loyalty with consumers.","So we like the business a lot. We like where it can go in the United States. In the back half of this year and early next year, you'll see us introduce it in European markets and in Canada, so we think the brand can travel as well. And we're just very, very pleased with the acquisition. And we're very, very pleased with the team and all they've done to continue to grow that brand in such a substantial way.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on all the gross margin commentary you put out there and some of the Q&A, you mentioned co-packer mix, the single-serve, the emerging market mix versus developed market cereal, for instance, weighing on gross margins in addition to the distribution costs. Can you give us a sense of how much of the decline is coming from big buckets, from each of these things and just the general outlook for each? For instance, on emerging markets, obviously, you would intend that to grow long-term at a higher rate. How much of that is going to be a longer-term gross margin drag? Thanks.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Sure. It's Fareed again. I mean, the biggest factor on margin was the mechanical impact of DSD, which was the single largest, and then Multipro. And think about that as sort of two-thirds, if you will.","The other piece is what you suggested. And if you kind of parse that out, is that we will expect to see our emerging markets business continue to outpace the core. That's our strategy, and so that dynamic will be a factor.","I think some of the quarter-on-quarter promotional differences, those will be behind us. And over time, on the co-packer scenario, as I mentioned, we'll address that. But that's not going to happen in a single quarter, but we're already on that. We started to see that portion of the business really accelerate as we were working our way through Q1, and so it's been on the radar. We've been refocusing some of our investments, and some of the incremental CapEx is going directly at that area.","So I think what we'll see is the DSD mechanical impact coming out this quarter. Multipro, we have a little bit more to lap. The emerging markets growth relative to core, that's going be an ongoing factor. And we'll then really be in the how quickly we can get behind sort of the single-serve and multi-pack. And these are great areas to be growing in, because it's we're under-indexed. It's incremental, and it's sort of where the consumer is going. And so it's the right place to be and the right place to grow. We just got to get our supply chain caught up with the demand.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, at the end of your prepared remarks, you commented on this year, you've had the ability to both grow earnings and reinvest, right? And that's partly from cost savings. The tax rate's also helpful a little bit, I guess. So I guess as we think about the increases in brand building that are now in your budgets for this year, as we look beyond 2018, is that a good base to work with going forward or is that spending sort of up one time and then comes down a little bit or is there room to actually increase it more? So just trying to get an understanding of that brand building base this year, how it's been expanded and how we should think about that going forward.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Bryan. I think a couple of things. You should think about the snacks DSD exit as a fundamental reset, which we said we were going to do, to go away from low ROI DSD cost into high ROI brand building investment. So that was a significant reset.","On top of that, we've been feeding the brands more to get them back to growth, because we know that the long-term algorithm that we have out there will build significant shareholder value, but you've got to get the top line growing. And all the investments are designed to do exactly that.","So broadly speaking, I think you can look at what we've done and say it's never going to be a steady-state, because we're going to continue to take a relentless approach around are we getting the right ROIs, are we spending the right way, and measuring that constantly to make sure that we're getting the right bang for our buck. But we like where it is right now.","We'll be dynamic and agile as we go forward in the future, so I won't say it's exactly where it needs to be, plus or minus, but we like where we are a lot better than where we've been with the Snacks reset and a lot more good brand building investment around our biggest brands.","And, as I said earlier, it's good to be in a position where we are today, where we can talk at the half-year point about all these big brands growing around the world. And if we can continue that, it's got good positive momentum. And you get the flywheel spinning, and it starts to work and these brands can fund themselves.","So broadly speaking, I think we like where we are today. And it was based on a lot of hard work coming out of the DSD transition, as well as a big lean in the fourth quarter of last year and all through this year, actually spending well above the $100 million that we said and above what we had budgeted.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","If I could just add, we are coming at this very much kind of brand by brand and bottom up, and so we're learning a lot about how they're performing. And while we like what we see, there's still, you have certain brands, Cheez-It is a great example, where that growth has really come back strongly. And it's responding very well to the investments.","There's other brands that are beginning to turn, but we were still finding that right balance of investment versus return on each of those. And so, that's the level that we're looking at it. And, again, this is new territory because Snacks is in a fundamentally different place than it was a year ago, but the investments behind these seem to be working well in terms of velocity and share. And we like what we see and we'll continue to kind of find that right balance. And I think another quarter or two, we'll learn an awful lot about where the right spot to be is.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John Renwick - Kellogg Co.","Operator, we've got time for maybe one more quick question.","Operator","And that question will come from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Thank you, just a couple questions, so now that you're in a position of strength in the U.S. in snacks, can you talk about the M&A strategy in snacks in the U.S.? I mean, what are the gaps that you need to fill or pretty much you have your hands full with your portfolio and there is no need to add any particular gaps there or cover any gaps?","And then the second question, which is related to this, when I think about overseas snacks business to me, it's mostly Pringles. Yes, you can try to export Cheez-It or RXBAR, but the brands are not known there. And it seems to me that STAX with Lay's in the U.S., it's a small equity compared to Pringles, but overseas, it's more of a direct competitor. So if you could just talk about the challenges that Pringles may face overseas in terms of brand and competition and just room to maybe add other brands overseas. I thought you would have made a bid for Tyrrells in the UK that Hersey sold but it seems that you did not. Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thank you for the question, Pablo. We think about our M&A strategy holistically. And so, a good guide to the way we think about it would be RXBAR in the U.S. filled a white space for us, doing extremely well. And then developing markets, snacks has been obviously a big focus for us with Pringles. And so, if we see those types of opportunities, we would clearly look at them.","And it's a build versus a buy type of thing. So Pringles is doing extremely well all around the world. And we'll continue to drive that, but if we see opportunities that can add shareholder value in the developing markets, we clearly will look at them. Probably more snacks-led in the U.S., more kind of wholesome-led, health and wellness-led and big focus on developing markets, but if we found another RXBAR in a developed markets, we'd clearly be interested in that as well.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Welcome to the Kellogg Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Simon Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference.","Simon Burton","Thank you, Tyrone. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our full year and fourth quarter 2011 results. I'm joined by John Bryant, our President and CEO; and Ron Dissinger, our Chief Financial Officer. The press release and slides that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. As you are aware, certain statements today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, February 6. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for 90 days. Now I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thank you, Simon. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a difficult year. We delivered continued strong top line growth in the quarter and the full year. In fact, fourth quarter growth was 6% and we ended the year with full year growth of 4.5%, above our long-term targets and in line with guidance. And the growth was broad-based across most geographies and categories. In addition, our categories continue to perform well and we gained share in many of them around the world. However, the results below net sales, while in line with recent guidance, were below our initial expectations and our long-term targets. As you all know, we increased the scope of our existing supply chain investment in the third quarter. This had a significant impact on the fourth quarter and full year results as expected. In addition, increased investment and reinstated incentive compensation costs also had an impact on full year results. ","We view 2011 and 2012 as transition years, given investment in our supply chain and incremental support of our brands in 2012. While we don't want to be in the position of lowering guidance, we recognized during the year that we had issues in our supply chain that needed to be addressed and we know that addressing those issues as quickly as we can is the right thing to do. We look forward to 2012 and beyond with optimism as we continue this investment, make significant additional investments in future growth and focus on the long-term drivers of our sustainable growth operating principle. ","Now let's turn to Slide 4, which details these drivers. Our sustainable growth operating principle, the actions we took in 2011 and the things we are doing in 2012 are all designed to get us back on the path to sustainable growth. This is a familiar slide to many, but not all of you. As you can see, on an ongoing basis, we constantly focus on the consumer and the strength of our brands. And as we said on the third quarter conference call, we expect an increase in the investment we will make in brand building in 2012 and we expect significant sales from innovation during the year. That's on top of posting approximately $800 million in incremental sales from innovation in 2011. In addition, we have a disciplined approach to overhead and have done a good job with this over the years, and 2012 will be no exception. Innovation, building on a foundation of consistent brand building will help improve price and mix, which has an impact on sales and should increase gross profit dollars, and in a year of normalized inflation, should also increase gross profit margin. While gross margin in 2012 is likely to be down slightly because of our expectations for another year of unusually high inflation, we believe that this sustainable growth model is the right way to run our business over the long term and we recognize that we have to invest this year to help next year and beyond. ","And now I'll turn it over to Ron for a review of our financial performance.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to Slide 5, you'll see, as John mentioned, that we delivered strong internal top line growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the full year. Both results are above our long-term targets and we're pleased with the company's continued top line momentum. Internal operating profit growth was 20.5% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our sales growth. For the full year, internal operating profit declined by 2.9%. These results were in line with our guidance. As we said on our third quarter earnings call, full year operating profit was significantly impacted by our supply chain investments, commodity inflation and the reinstatement of our incentive compensation costs. In fact, for the full year, the incentive compensation costs lowered operating profit by approximately 5 points and the supply chain investments also impacted operating profit by a similar amount. So underlying operating profit growth would have been in line with our long-term targets without the impact of these discrete items and lapping the cereal recall from 2010. Both reported and currency neutral earnings per share increased by 25% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, reported earnings per share were up 2.4% and currency neutral earnings per share were flat, in line with our guidance. ","Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a review of the components of revenue growth. Volume decreased slightly in the fourth quarter and was flat for the full year, in line with our expectations. We are happy with our net sales growth this year, including the very strong price mix growth of 6.6% in the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the full year. While pricing actions were the primary contributor to our growth, we also saw good mix improvement across our businesses. Currency translation benefited our full year results by 2 points but have reduced our sales growth by 6\/10 of 1 point in the fourth quarter and we expect currency to be a headwind in 2012 as well. So we remain pleased of revenue growth for both the full year and the fourth quarter exceeded our long-term targets, and importantly, we expect continued strong growth in 2012. ","Slide 7 details gross profit and gross margin results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. Fourth quarter gross profit was $1.2 billion and internal growth was 4%. For the full year, gross profit was $5.4 billion and internal growth was 1%. Our gross margin declined by 70 basis points in the quarter to 40.9%. The supply chain investments had a considerable impact on our fourth quarter results, lowering gross margin by more than 100 basis points. On a full year basis, gross margin declined by 140 basis points to 41.3%, in line with previous guidance, with supply chain investments contributing more than half of the decline. These investments were primarily made across our U.S. network and included cost to add people back into our plants, increased logistics costs and reduced operating leverage caused by some production lines being down for refurbishment. ","Now let's turn to Slide 8 and our brand building investment for the full year. As you can see, brand building investment was back end weighted in 2010 but was much more evenly distributed in 2011. This led to some unusual comparisons as we progressed through this year. For the full year, our brand building was essentially flat due to our decision to reduce investment across Europe. We make our investments where we see the greatest returns, and quite frankly, we didn't see the returns we wanted in Europe. What you can't see on this slide is the shift of our spending in recent years to digital media. This shift has allowed us to partially offset inflation and increase effectiveness at the same time. We've done a lot of work measuring the optimization of our mix and we'll continue to review our spending plans in 2012. We expect brand building to increase at a rate at least equal to sales growth in 2012, providing us with funds to support our innovation pipeline and exciting commercial ideas. ","Slide 9 shows our advertising as a percentage of net sales versus the peer group. We have the highest investment rate in the peer group. While this was partially the result of the categories in which we compete, it is also due to our commitment to advertising and brand building as a whole. We're a branded food company and we recognize that having strong brands is essential to our success. ","Slide 10 details internal operating profit performance for the company and each of the businesses for both the full year and the fourth quarter. Operating profit increased by 21% in the quarter but decreased 3% for the year, driven by supply chain investments, commodity costs and the reinstated incentive compensation costs. North America internal operating profit increased by 18% in the quarter, driven by very strong sales growth and the timing of brand building. Of course, our ongoing supply chain investments and reinstatement of incentive compensation had a negative effect on operating profit growth, resulting in a decline of 1% for the full year. Europe's internal operating profit declined by 11% in the fourth quarter, due in part to a decline in sales that resulted from the continued difficult operating environment in the region. While we saw some pricing and mix improvements in the region, they were not sufficient to cover commodity cost increases and volume declines. In Latin America, internal operating profit declined by 10% in the fourth quarter, largely as a result of significant double-digit increases in the level of brand building. We also increased brand building at a double-digit rate for the full year, driving sales growth of 10% and operating profit growth of 9%. So a great achievement by the team in Latin America. And internal operating profit in Asia Pacific increased by 430%, due largely to last year's impairment of assets in China. Without this impact, operating profit would have increased by approximately 50%, driven by broad-based sales growth. ","Now let's turn to Slide 11 and cash flow. Our full year cash flow was slightly more than $1 billion. Working capital was higher due to an increase in receivables. This increase resulted from strong sales in the quarter, driven by our innovation launches and Special K New Year's resolutions programs. Our inventories also increased year-over-year to support our new product introductions and maintain appropriate levels of service, while working on our supply chain infrastructure. Importantly though, year-end trade inventories were approximately unchanged from last year's level. Capital spending equaled 4.5% of net sales due to investment in our supply chain infrastructure and capacity requirements in certain markets. And for the full year, we've repurchased approximately $800 million in shares, which means we have approximately $650 million of our $2.5 billion 3-year program remaining. ","Slide 12 shows the history of our improvement in core working capital over the years. We have gone from a high of almost 12% in 2000 to an industry-leading level of less than 7% today. We realize that core working capital has increased slightly over the past few years but we see this as an opportunity for future cash flow improvement in 2012 and future years. As I mentioned, 2011 was impacted by the timing of our Special K Resolution program and new product introductions. ","Slide 13 details the cash we returned to shareholders over the last 5 years. As you can see, we've returned approximately $6 billion over that time and the amounts has been well-balanced over the period between both dividends and share repurchases. We also used our cash to maintain targeted levels of debt and to allow us to pursue complementary acquisitions. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and are pleased with our performance over the years. ","Slide 14 shows the detailed full-year guidance that we always provide on fourth quarter conference calls. We are reaffirming the guidance that we provided last quarter. We expect continued strong revenue growth of between 4% and 5% in 2012. This growth will be the result of price realization and mix improvements driven by innovation and supported by increased investment in brand building. In fact, we continue to expect that annual brand building investment will increase at a rate equal to or greater than the strong rate of revenue growth. Gross margin will be down slightly. We anticipate around 7% cost of goods inflation, most of which will be driven by commodity and packaging inflation. We expect savings from productivity to be slightly above 3%, consistent with our long-term targets. We continue to expect that operating profit will be flat to up slightly for the full year. This is the result of our increased brand building investment and IT costs associated with the update of our SAP platform. We expect interest expense to be slightly favorable versus 2011 and the full year tax rate to be higher at approximately 30%. Currency neutral earnings per share are expected to increase between 2% and 4% or to a range between $3.45 and $3.52 per share. When we ran spot rates a couple of days ago, the analysis suggested that currencies will reduce earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Obviously, that estimate will change during the year and we will update you each quarter with our expectations. We anticipate that cash flow will be in a range between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Capital spending is expected to be between 4% and 5% of sales, above our long-term run rate of 3% to 4%. And we plan to finish the remaining $650 million of our current share repurchase program. ","So all in all, 2012 will be a year where we continue to set the foundation for future growth to our sustainable growth operating principle. As John said, we remain committed to this principle and the generation of profitable sales growth and improving cash flow and return on invested capital over time. We're making good progress and we'll continue to drive improvement in 2012 and beyond. And while we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, I thought it would be important to remind you of a few items that will impact the first quarter. As you know, we increased the level of investment in our supply chain in Q3 of 2011 and that investment is continuing. Second, we had some discrete items that lowered our tax rate several points in the first quarter of 2011. And finally, the $0.04 of currency impact we expect this year primarily impacts the first half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to John for a review of the individual businesses.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. If you will turn to Slide 15, you'll see some of the recent innovation we've launched. As you know, every year, we launch a significant number of new products across both regions and categories. For example, this year, we have Morningstar Farms meal starters for people lowering their intake of meat. We have All-Bran breakfast biscuits in Europe and on-the-go breakfast for adults. And we have Kashi steamed meals, to name just a few. This isn't all of the innovation we have but it does give you an idea of the activity we've had and some of the exciting new products we've introduced. ","Slide 16 shows a few highlights from the innovation that's been launched recently. The intention of this slide is to highlight some of the kinds of innovation we've targeted. For years, we have successfully transferred ideas from one region to another and we continue to focus on this. The slide shows just 2 recent examples: Mini Max, a version of the U.S.' small Mini-Wheats, which we recently launched in the U.K.; and Krave, a product launching in the U.S. and Mexico that's been very popular in Europe. And it's not just the food that travels. The positioning of Mini Max in the U.K. full and focused children is very similar to the U.S. positioning of Mini-Wheats. A new product for us, Special K Cracker Chips, has been very successful in its first year and we have 2 new flavors that have been introduced early in 2012. In fact, Cracker Chips is one of our most successful cracker innovations. We've gained share and sales have far exceeded our expectations. Gluten-free Rice Krispies is an example of innovations that addresses the trend toward gluten-free products. This was also something that we successfully focused on the past and finally, the Natural Food channel has posted strong growth over the years and our Kashi brand is well-positioned to capitalize on this. As a result, we have recently introduced a new version of GOLEAN Crisp! cereal and other products within this exciting category. And as we mentioned last quarter, we have a significant amount of innovation planed for 2012, which will build on the good year we had in 2011. ","Slide 17 shows the top line results for Kellogg North America and Kellogg International over the last year. Both businesses posted strong revenue growth for the full year and in the fourth quarter. Kellogg North America posted 5% growth for the full year and 7% growth in the fourth quarter. Kellogg International posted 3% growth for the full year and 5% growth in the fourth quarter. ","Now let's look at Slide 18 and some more detail regarding the North American business. The total North American business exceeded our long-term sales growth targets in 2011 and in the fourth quarter. And as you can see, each of the individual businesses met or exceeded these targets. Cereal, snacks and frozen and Specialty Channels all benefited from good innovation programs, which helped drive the sales growth. These results are further evidence of the continued underlying strength of our business. ","Slide 19 details the performance of the North America Retail Cereal business. Fourth quarter growth was 1% and full year growth was 4%. In conjunction with this, we also gained category share in 2011 and you can see in measured channel data that we've done this while moving our focus away from promotional spending and while growing quality merchandising. Of course, we remain committed to investment in brand building. Innovation drives category growth and we significantly over-indexed in cereal innovation. New products contributed to the quarterly and full year growth, including Special K Oats & Honey, Crunchy Nut and Touch of Fruit Mini-Wheats. In addition, core products such as Frosted Flakes had a very good year as a result of effective brand building programs. We expect the cereal category to be more challenging in 2012. However, we do have a strong innovation program planned, which includes the introduction of Krave. And although it is early, initial indications are that Krave is off to a good start. We also have flavor extensions planned for 2 innovations from 2011: Crunchy Nut and Touch of Fruit Mini-Wheats. And we also have some packaging innovation underway and brand building programs planned to behind Frosted Flakes, Special K and Mini-Wheats. ","Turning to Slide 20 and Retail Snacks, we closed the year with another quarter of excellent growth. In fact, the snacks business posted full year revenue growth of 5% and crackers, wholesome snacks and cookies all posted growth. The cracker business posted double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and high single-digit growth for the full year. And we gained share behind strength in Special K Cracker Chips and Cheez-It. As I mentioned earlier, Special K Cracker Chips had been one of our most successful new launches ever in this category and we're excited by the strong start to 2012, posted by both the existing flavors and the 2 new ones we've just introduced. In cookies, our focus on the Keebler brand is working. In fact, the brand had a very good quarter, posting strong sales growth and the category grew in both the quarter and the full year as well. And in the wholesome snacks category, growth was good and built on a double-digit comp last year. Growth in our business was driven by Special K bars, which posted good results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. And FiberPlus continues to do well in its third year and the newest introduction, caramel coconut fudge, is already as large as each of the other 3 flavors. Finally, Pop-Tarts again grew share in 2011 behind new introductions, such as the popular Mini Crisps. ","Now let's turn to Slide 21, which shows the performance of our frozen and Specialty Channels businesses. The business posted 10% growth for the full year and 14% sales growth in the fourth quarter, lapping 8% growth in the fourth quarter of 2010. Eggo posted category share gains in 2011 and the category itself continued to grow at mid-single-digit rates and we expect the frozen business to continue to grow faster than the company overall. We recently launched 6 new products including waffles, new large Eggo Thick & Fluffy, Simply Eggo and Eggo Protein Original Waffles. And we also have a strong brand building program planned for the first quarter. Morningstar Farms continued to increase its category share as well in 2011, and we have new brand building planned in innovation being launched in the first quarter. And we're also launching 4 SKUs of new Kashi Steamed Meals. These meals prepared in minutes, and provide the combination of taste and nutrition you'd expect from Kashi. And our Specialty Channels business posted strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and we increased sales in all of our major customers in 2011. ","Slide 22 shows the performance of our international businesses for the quarter and the year. Total internal sales growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Europe posted sales declines of 1% for the quarter and the year. The operating environment in Europe continues to be difficult as a result of economic conditions and competitive activity. In the U.K., our largest business in the region, we have seen high levels of competitive activity in a challenging retail environment. As we mentioned last quarter, we have too little innovation and support in the U.K. in recent months but we have recently launched All-Bran Golden Crunch, new flavors of Krave and Mini Max, as I mentioned earlier. We have a better pipeline of ideas and support planned for the U.K. in 2012, although we recognize that it will continue to be a difficult environment. The rest of Europe also reported mixed results in 2011, with France and Italy posting good growth and weaker results in some other markets. Sales growth was good in Russia, where we continue to transition from a non-branded to a branded product mix. We remain confident regarding the long-term prospects in Europe and we won't be happy until we return this business to its historical rates of growth. However, the entire regions is being affected by the current economic situation and although we have stronger plans for 2012, we expect the environment to remain challenging. ","In Asia Pacific, net sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. In Australia, we gained cereal category share in the fourth quarter and the customer issue we referenced last quarter has been resolved. In Asia, sales in the quarter increased at a high single-digit rate, driven by strong growth in India, South Africa and Korea. And we expect continued strong growth from this region in 2012. Our Latin American business grew by 10% in 2011 and closed the year with 15% internal sales growth in the fourth quarter. Investment in brand building increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter, behind increased innovation activity and also increased at a double-digit rate for the full year. The business doubled its rate of innovation in 2011, including the introduction of Krave in Mexico in September, which has had early success and already has more than 1 point of category share. In addition, we relaunched the Special K brand across the region, which has also gone well. And we launched new versions of Rice Krispies, Choco Krispies, Froot Loops, Special K bars and All-Bran bars. While Latin America is always a volatile economic environment, we're confident in our growth plans for the region. ","Now let's turn to Slide 23. We're running the business the right way for the long term. We continue to invest in our brands and bring exciting innovation to consumers. We have invested back in our supply chain to ensure that we have the right supply chain for today and the future. We remain committed to our proven operating principles and our strong businesses in good categories. And finally, we also remain committed to our long-term targets of 3% to 4% internal sales growth, 4% to 6% internal operating profit growth and 7% to 9% currency neutral earnings per share growth. I believe that we are doing the right things for the future of the company, things that are driving strong sales growth now and that will drive sustainable performance in the years to come. And with that, I'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to jump into the lower SG&A margin a bit. You cited lower brand building and that makes sense but wasn't this an issue last quarter too? So I'm curious what the other drivers were besides that and the lapping of the China impairments cost, of course, to the lower SG&A margin. If you could walk us through some of the magnitude there, it would be helpful and maybe address some of the sustainability of that margin has declined to.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Ken, it's Ron. Really the primary driver of the decline in SG&A margin is the strong sales growth that we had in the quarter. We did say that our brand building timed a bit differently over the course of 2012 versus 2011. Quite frankly, that was relatively small in the fourth quarter. We were down around $10 million on brand building, 30 basis points of that SG&A margin impact. So really, it's a function of a strong sales growth, Ken.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just as a quick follow-up, I mean, you had strong sales growth in the past and we haven't seen this kind of drop in SG&A. So was there something different maybe this quarter that would have driven it down? I understand that the higher sales and the higher volumes will, of course, benefit your fixed costs leverage but I was just a little surprised to see the magnitude there this time.","Ronald L. Dissinger","There isn't, Ken. I mean, it's really the strong sales growth. There are no other unusual or unique items. You mentioned the China impairment but frankly, our overhead's relatively consistent year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Mushkin of Jefferies.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to -- our first blush at this Nielsen data was pretty poor, at least in the measured channel as we look at it, just generally speaking, we haven't got into a lot of details. And I just want to understand what your thought process is. We've seen some comments from other people about a lot of channel shifting but it seems like it can't all be channel shifting. So I want to see what your thoughts are on just kind of a -- what's going on in January? And do you think the consumer's really taking a step back in the food channel or is there something else going on? And then my second question, really you talked a lot about your new product development. I look forward to it but I was wondering if you could maybe delve in to a little bit your acquisition strategy, if things have changed in your thought process there, particularly at maybe acquiring some of these kind of the healthier brands?","John A. Bryant","Scott, firstly on the measured data, we are seeing a larger gap between measured data and our assessment of how some of the categories are performing. I'll give you one example, U.S. cereal. The measured data would suggest something like 1% to 2% category growth in the fourth quarter and we saw more, like 2% to 3%. So I think you need to add roughly 2 points of growth to the measured data to get to the non-measured or total category performance. So I would suggest some channel shifting going on within the environment. Secondly, on acquisition strategy, we continue to look at acquisitions around the world, bolt-on acquisitions. They can be in the area of healthier brands like BearNaked or they can be in the area of snacks. They can be international. So we continue to look and it's something that we are always focused on.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And as you look forward, to follow-up on a little bit on kind of how you deploy capital. I mean, how do you -- as you look at this, how do you think acquisitions play into it?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Our uses of cash, Scott, are very consistent with what we've done in the past. Certainly, we recognize the importance of our dividend. I talked about the share repurchase program and repurchasing approximately $650 million of shares in 2012. So basically the remainder of our program. And then we'll look at complementary acquisitions. So it's really a combination of those 3.","John A. Bryant","In the past, when we've done small acquisitions, this tended to be a small increase in our debt. I think if we did a larger acquisitions, that might look at that share buyback piece. But in general, it's really just an addition to our cash returns.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, did I hear you right that, I think, you said that you expect the cereal category to be a little bit more difficult in 2012 than it was in 2011? If so, is that more of a consumer concern or is it more related to your expectations for what the promotional environment's going to look like this year?","John A. Bryant","Ed, I think the cereal category is always an intensely competitive category. I think it's a good long-term category, it's on trend from the health and wellness nutrition perspective, aging population, out-of-breakfast snacking and so on. But this really is a sort of low single-digit growth type category. And we're expecting that sort of performance in 2012 as well. I think it's also worth pointing out that we have been moving some of our promoted price points in the category. So in the fourth quarter, we increased our promoted price points on our medium-sized kid brands from $1.99 to $2.49; and on Special K and Rice Krispies Treats -- Rice Krispies, from $2.49 to $2.99. And as we've done that, we've seen some volume loss as consumers get used to the new price points and I expect that to continue probably into the first quarter. So I think that's more where we're seeing just some of the impact of the pricing go through the category and consumers get used to the new price points.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John and Ron, you talked about gross margin likely being down a bit in 2012 for the year. Just trying to get a better sense of the drivers there. You've got probably 4% to 5% pricing. You talked about productivity of 3%, which should be, I would think, more than enough to offset what is still going to be, clearly, an inflationary year for you. Are there other things, is it some additional of the supply-chain spending working through? Maybe just a little bit of the buckets that are impacting your margin for the year would be helpful.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Sure, Andrew, this is Ron. In terms of our cost inflation, we said is around 7% and cost saving's around 3%. So think of it at approximately a net 4% of inflation. We talked about top line being up 4% to 5% in the combination of price and mix. And it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 75% price, 25% mix. So when you rattle all of that through, our gross profit dollars are growing slightly lower than our sales growth, which is driving the margin down. In terms of the supply chain investments, Andrew, as we've said, very consistent levels of spending in 2012 as we had in 2011.","Operator","Our next question is from David Driscoll of Citi Invest.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on SG&A but my question will be a little bit more detailed. So during the first 3 quarters of 2011, SG&A cost rose by 8%. In the fourth quarter, declined by 0.4% and that's after backing out the China impairment charge in 4Q '10. So I'm trying to make the numbers all apples to apples. I realized that incentive comp was up about $100 million and on a dollar basis, that seems to leave about $100 million of increase year-on-year in SG&A for the full year to be explained. So, Ron, can you try to tackle the question in that form? And then there'll be a follow-on related to how to think about 2012.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. In terms of our SG&A being up in the front part of the year, remember, we discussed the timing of brand building. In 2010, our brand building was a little bit soft in the front half and in 2011, our brand building was up in the front half versus 2010. So that's certainly a factor. You talked a little bit about the incentive compensation. That was spread more over the back end of the year. So really, it's a function of those 2 items and then just general overhead inflation, very consistent with our expectations of growing our overhead at half the rate of sales growth.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then in 2012, would you -- obviously, we don't have the incentive comp issue but would you expect the rate of growth underlying that? So you made the explicit comments on brand building, leaving brand building out of it, the rest of the bucket in SG&A, would you expect it to grow consistent with what we saw in 2011?","Ronald L. Dissinger","We still are very disciplined on overhead and recall our operating principle on overhead growth is to grow it at half the rate of sales growth. So you'd see kind of that level of growth flowing through our overhead and then we said we were making a meaningful step up in brand building.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you quantify, in the $100 million that you're spending on supply chain, can you quantify how much of that is related to asset write-downs in 2011? Same question for 2012.","Ronald L. Dissinger","There wouldn't be a lot of asset write-down necessarily within that $100 million. We do have some money tied up in upfront costs, David, but the $100 million is a combination of ongoing and a small amount of onetime costs and then depreciation related to the step up in capital spending.","John A. Bryant","If I could just jump in on that. I think it's important on the supply chain just to step back here a bit. We have completed our evaluation across our network of things that we need to do, we're making the right decisions here to build the foundation for the long term. In 2011, a portion of that $100 million was additional people in the plants, and additional depreciation from step up in capital, as well as some onetime-type costs as we did some changes in our network. In 2012, we now have a full year of those people costs. We have another step up in depreciation from the additional capital and we have a smaller amount of onetime costs, if you like, or unusual cost. As we go forward, we see that $100 million as a step up in our cost structure. So we don't expect that to come back out again. However, of course, we're always looking to be more efficient in our supply chain. If we can find a way to decrease those costs over time, we will. But we're confident also these investments will generate a return for us long term because these people in our plants will help us identify additional different productivity savings in the future.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions for you. I wanted to ask about the Europe or really the U.K. outlook and just, I guess, something that you pulled back on brand building there, probably the appropriate move. I'm just curious what you see there for say, 2012 with the category and with your own performance where you've had some, I think, some products launched in that kind of thing in the category.","John A. Bryant","Chris, Europe is our most difficult region as a company. Really it breaks down into 3 different businesses. First, Russia and Russia grew high-single digits in 2011. I think we're building a stronger business there over time, it's continuing to transition from an bulk or non-branded business to a branded business. And some of that happened in the fourth quarter. In fact, you saw some volume decline in Europe in the fourth quarter. About half of that volume decline was actually some non-branded business that we were walking away from in Russia. On the continent, we saw improvement in the continent as we went through the year but then as we got into the back part of the year, the continent started to go a little soft as well. So we're seeing some growth in France and Italy but the remainder is mixed and I think the difficult economic environment and the state of the euro zone is weighing on our business in the continent. In the U.K., we have better plans in place for 2012. We have a new General Manager who started January 1. We actually managed to hold share in cereal in the fourth quarter but it is going to be a difficult environment with a tough retail environment, a very competitive environment and a consumer under pressure. As we look at Europe and 2012, we are hoping to see slight top line growth in Europe and hopefully, we can hold operating profits stable year-on-year but there may even be a slight decline in operating profits, just recognizing the difficulty of the environment.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Are you increasing promotion in, say, the U.K.? It sounds like your toughest market. Is that a factor in your revenue assumptions for 2012 for Europe?","John A. Bryant","We did increase a little bit of spend and promotional activity in the fourth quarter to help stabilize the share. What is interesting is in some of these markets in Europe, our share of voice actually jumped to 75% to 80% as some of our competitors have pulled back dramatically on brand building and put their spend more into allowances. That's not the game that we like to play. Obviously, we have to keep watching our plans in Europe and we'll have to take the appropriate actions as we go through the year.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a final or a quick one, the U.S. cereal inventories, and where they stand today or generally, how you feel about those inventories today?","John A. Bryant","We feel good about the inventories. They're at a very similar level from a trade inventory perspective as last year. And so, it's a pretty good position.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You touched on it a little bit but can you talk about the progress of the supply chain investments? Have you found any surprises either to the upside or the downside in how you are allocating the capital? And can you also talk about again, the progress of where you are and what you're spending on right now and what you will be progressively spending on throughout the year?","John A. Bryant","Well, we're tracking along right in line with our expectations on the supply chain. We're executing against a plan that we developed in the back part of last year. I wouldn't say there's been any major surprises one way or the other and that plan includes adding people back into some of the facilities, additional capital and depreciation related to that and some movement of product around the plants to do some things we want to do in these plants. So no real changes there.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then in terms of the time frame, what have you done now and then what do you expect to do in the back half in terms of -- maybe a little bit more specifics, if possible?","John A. Bryant","Well, maybe I'll go to the weighting of investment over the course of the year. I think we'd expect that investment to be relatively consistent or even over the course of the year versus it being somewhat back end weighted in 2011.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","The performance in 2011, 2012, reminds me a bit of back in '98, '99, when volume to value was kind of introduced as a concept and it worked then longer term. I know it's always worked for Kellogg but your guidance for '12 sounds like it implies maybe flat to slightly down volume. When do you think we'll be able to start to see more tonnage increases? And if you could, give us any kind of color on what the regional tonnage outlook is. Do you expect volume to be down in Europe, for instance?","John A. Bryant","Tim, I agree with you that if you go back to '98, '99, it is similar to that timeframe right now for the Kellogg Company. I think we are back on our sustainable -- trying to get back on our sustainable growth model. I think if you look in 2011, we had strong underlying sales growth. And if you try to get to the true earnings power of the company, I believe it's stronger than it appears on the surface. So if you adjust 2011 for the incentive compensation, you've got 5 points of headwind. You adjust for the supply chain, changes that we made about another 5 points of headwind and then you adjust, say, for lapping the recall last year. You try to pull all that together, I think you'll see the core earnings power of the company is at mid-single-digit operating profit growth. And I think as we go forward here, we'll continue to play the mix game element of the sustainable growth model. So it's not about just a focus on volume, it's about driving the top line and up-weighting the consumer or driving the consumer to higher value-added products, which we are seeing with launch of Crunchy Nut, FiberPlus and Krave in the first quarter of this year. So I think we are on that path. In terms of volume itself, I believe that volume growth is being held back by the level of pricing that's being required to take to offset inflation. Unfortunately, I think we need to take that level of pricing. We need to protect the economics of the business first and foremost so we can invest back in brand building and drive the business the right way. Hopefully, we get a period here of more normalized inflation. We probably then have less pricing and have a better balance of volume, price and mix to drive the top line. On the regional volume cost [ph], I don't want to give guidance at a regional level. I think it's fair to say that volume is likely to be under pressure in Europe in 2012.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Simon is a little bit more physically intimidating than Catherine so I'll try to keep my questions to a limited number. I guess first, just more specifically on upfront charges, what do you expect for 2012?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Our upfront costs, Eric, in 2012 will be very consistent with 2011.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And as usual, I assume that you are including those in your dollar earnings guidance?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Absolutely, we are.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, maybe this goes back to Ken's question but on the segment results, looking back over the last, whatever, 10 to 15 years, the fourth quarter profit has been anywhere in North America, anywhere from $50 million to $100 million lower sequentially. And I've asked about this in the past and you've always said, well, it's kind of the way we accrue things, et cetera, et cetera, but with the supply chain investments and I'm just kind of very surprised that the sequential profit in North America was so solid. I mean, was there -- were there like those recall insurance proceeds in there or -- because it just doesn't seem that because you had some sales lift, which, again, isn't that different versus history, that you would just have such solid sequential profits when history has suggested the exact opposite, even excluding all this spending.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Eric, in terms of the performance in North America and really the company as a whole, the fourth quarter results were primarily a function of that strong sales growth and really good price realization in that quarter as well.","John A. Bryant","Eric, I think if you look at the SG&A absolute dollar spend year-on-year, it didn't change very much. But the sales line comes through the top and just rolls through the P&L. So our economics are very top-line sensitive. We can drive the top line, we get very good operating leverage and expansion.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a last follow-up, I was a little bit surprised at your response to the M&A question. You brought in a lot of new people, you're literally fixing some plant floors. The last couple of acquisitions have been a real struggle. So are you kind of suggesting that you're comfortable enough to make a deal tomorrow? Or was that really more of a long-term type of response?","John A. Bryant","Eric, I think we're always looking at acquisitions. And I think we've had a reasonably good track record over the years of acquisitions. So I'm not trying to signal anything here to you. I'm just saying that it's always something that we're constantly reviewing and looking at in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about the emergence of alternative channels? And I'm thinking particularly very fast-growing areas like the Dollar Store channel. It seems to me that in the past, a lot of the growth was coming from the Wal-Mart supercenters and we've heard a number of companies or a couple of companies recently saying they're moving more towards third-party distribution models. Could you basically just give us some commentary about how this change in the retail environment is changing your operations from a manufacturing and supply-chain perspective? And is it a big burden on the company as it changes?","John A. Bryant","We are seeing growth, Alexia, in channels like Dollar and club. And I think it is a consumer looking for value, whether it's an absolute price point in Dollar or price per pound in club. I don't think it's impacting our go-to-market strategy. We try to keep our margins relatively stable across the channels if you look at the total cost to serve of that channel. And we have very good execution capabilities in those channels already.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Serotta of Wells Fargo.","Eric Serotta - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but I wanted to follow-up on Tim's question with respect to volumes. This is basically the third year in a row of kind of flat to down volumes. When you look at 2011 and the 2012 outlook, how much did the volume deleveraging have an impact on your gross and operating margins? If you could sort of, I know you're not going to give us a specific number, but if you could help dimensionalize that, that would be real helpful.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. Eric, this is Ron. Certainly, our running volumes through our manufacturing plant has an impact on operating leverage but we try to manage that cost structure effectively even when volumes are down. So I'd rather not quantify the impact of volume absorption across our business.","John A. Bryant","And to put that volume into context, 2011, our volume was essentially flat. In fact, if you back out some of the abnormal items such as China, volume lossage is a business that we have subsequently sold and some volume loss in Russia as we move away from non-branded business in that market, our volume as a company, actually, will be up slightly.","Eric Serotta - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as you look to 2012, are you anticipating a negative impact from volume deleveraging?","Ronald L. Dissinger","I think it's reasonable to expect volume again to be under pressure, flattish, maybe down slightly in 2012, reflecting the level of pricing we've had to take. And obviously, we've put that thinking into our cost structure as we run our plants. But we're not talking about dramatic volume declines here.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney of Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","John, thinking back, I thought Tim made a good point about volume to value. In a more pointed way, your stack-to-volume since Q4 2007, I'm just looking at the disclosed numbers here, is down about 11.4% it looks like. And on a consolidated basis, it's down about 4%. So when we think about the next 4 years, I see how volume-to-value might make sense. Is it your -- I mean, Ron mentioned you're sort of shifting ad spend out of some markets and into others to where there's return. What you saw, it seemed to me, in early 2000s, though, was an increase in advertising spending. And, of course, while coming off high levels, you seem to be decreasing advertising spending at the moment. So I just -- I kind of want understand like how you think about that ROI and if that's, in fact, the plan. Do we get to where our relative ad spend level is appropriate to the current sort of opportunities set that you see?","Ronald L. Dissinger","As you know, our business response to innovation and brand building and we are increasing our brand building and our advertising meaningfully in 2012. Certainly, we expect that to have an impact on volume but with the level of price that we're putting into the marketplace. We think our volume, as John says, is more likely to be flat to slightly down.","John A. Bryant","And I think as our position on brand building is looking to increase in 2012, and we think that's a part of getting us back on our sustainable growth model, and that, in time, should help us drive a bit of balance between volume, price and mix.","Simon Burton","And Tyrone, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question is from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up, another follow-up on your euro cereal comment, John, being difficult. And you mentioned that pricing is hurting the category and the promoted price points in particular are going up. And that makes sense that, that was going to probably hurt promoted volume in the near term. But we've seen cereal do well during periods of inflation before and pricing go through in this category because it's still pretty cheap eats, particularly for the food value that it gives Americans. It tends to do well during these periods of inflation. And this time, it doesn't feel like the momentum is there. It's not all that great even when you look at the behavior of the company, it's like they don't seem to have this fly wheel of innovation and increased spending behind it where the momentum's there and you're feeding this animal that is very responsive to that spending. Is that comment fair, John? I mean, this category doesn't seem to have the momentum yet?","John A. Bryant","Well, I think that if the category's doing reasonably well in a difficult environment. In the fourth quarter, we think the category was up something like 2% to 3%; full year, up 1% to 2%. When you take into account all of the channels, not just the measured channels, which unfortunately lack some of the growth that we're seeing elsewhere in the category. And we've taken a number of price increases in U.S. cereal and our base sales are actually hanging together reasonably well. I think when you move your promoted price points, you're going to have a little bit more of an impact in the short term as the consumers get used to that. And I think that's what we're seeing in the case of our business in the fourth quarter, probably into the first quarter of this year. So I think if you step back from the category, it is a good category. It is driven by innovation and by brand building. I believe that the category growth is determined by the combination of what all the manufacturers do. We're driving innovation hard. We're driving brand building. I think some other players are talking about doing similar things and I expect that in combination to grow in the category. I don't see it as a 0-sum gain.","Simon Burton","Okay, everyone, thanks very much for participating today and we'll be available afterwards for follow-ups as usual.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Welcome to the Kellogg Company First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note this event is being recorded. Thank you.","At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.","John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter 2018 results. I'm joined this morning by: Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; Fareed Khan, our Chief Financial Officer; and Amit Banati, our President of Asia Pacific, who's calling in from Singapore to update you not only on our strong performance and outlook in that region, but also on some exciting news we have in West Africa.","Slide number 2 shows our unusual forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, profit margins, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements.

For your benefit, we issued an 8-K filing on April 19, 2018, that provides all of the recast line items.","And now, I'll turn it over to Steve and slide number 3.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're obviously pleased to report such a strong start to 2018, with growth in net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow.","There are three elements I'd like to emphasize. First, returning to top line growth is a priority for us, and it's gratifying to see so much of our portfolio showing improvement. Our on-trend Frozen Foods business has accelerated its strong growth. In U.S. Snacks, behind the noise of DSD exit impacts, our core brands are gaining share again. And our overall business is increasing its velocities on shelf. And Pringles is growing strongly worldwide. We stabilized our core international developed cereal markets and even showed some improvement. And we've built scale in snacking presence in emerging markets and it's paying off with (2:59) accelerated growth in those markets.","Second, we're on track to achieve our full-year guidance. We got off to a strong start in every metric. Our net sales grew ahead of our expected full-year pace. We also improved our operating profit margin. Our productivity initiatives are allowing us both to cover increased cost pressures and deliver on our promise to reinvest behind our brands. Brand building was increased at a strong double-digit rate in Q1 and will be again in Q2, and it's investment behind better consumer ideas. We're truly Deploying for Growth.","And third, we continue to make exciting progress on reshaping our portfolio. Parati, the company we acquired in Brazil at the end of 2016, sustained its strong growth in Q1, and it's enabling us to pursue additional revenue and cost synergies in Brazil and South America. RXBAR, acquired in late 2017, also sustained its exceptional growth in Q1, expanding its distribution and now expanding its product line as well.","And in West Africa, we are announcing today increased investments that allow us to further capitalize on an enormous growth opportunity and even enable these operations' rapid growth to flow through our financial statements. This will give you better visibility on our expansion in this key emerging market. In fact, it will bring our annual sales in emerging markets from being less than 15% of our company's sales to something closer to 20%. This is yet another example of us Deploying for Growth.","We know we still have work to do. For instance, in U.S. Morning Foods and in Kashi snacks, we're busy getting back to basics and investing in what we know can grow. These softer businesses were already incorporated into our guidance, and we have plans to stabilize them as the year progresses. As we go through our results today and our outlook, I hope you'll see why we are so confident that we are on the right track as a company.","So let me now turn it over to Fareed, who will walk you through our financials.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 4 summarizes our results for the first quarter. It was a good quarter, demonstrating improved financial performance on all metrics. Net sales grew year-on-year, including on an organic basis. And this continues an improving quarterly trend, and we saw improved performance across most of our portfolio. This certainly gives us increased confidence in the full year.","Operating profit grew year-on-year as well, and this great growth came in spite of substantial, planned double-digit increases in brand building. We could afford to do this, of course, because of Project K savings, including our eliminated DSD overhead and because of our top-line growth. And finally, EPS in Q1 increased at a double-digit rate. Specifically, this was $1.23 per share on an adjusted basis, and $1.19 on a currency-neutral adjusted basis.","In addition to the growth in operating profit, this EPS growth was aided by U.S. tax reform as well as a separate discrete tax benefit this quarter. But EPS was up solidly, even without that. So a very good start to the year, and let's examine the results in a little bit more detail.","Slide 5 walks you through the components of our net sales growth in Q1. Excluding currency, which was a strong positive in the quarter, our net sales grew more than 2% year-on-year. RX, which was acquired in October of last year, contributed 1.6 points of this growth. And this includes not only the sales that we acquired, but also the strong year-on-year growth that this business continued to generate. Steve will talk about that more in a moment.","On an organic basis, our sales were up nearly 1% year-on-year, our first organic growth in a few quarters and yet another sign that we are making progress. Keep in mind that this organic growth comes in spite of the impact of last year's DSD exit, specifically SKU rationalization and the elimination of the price premium we used to charge for DSD services.","In the quarter, this somewhat mechanical impact was around negative 1.5%, suggesting a third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in net sales growth, excluding the DSD impact. Even if you account for year-ago comparisons for the smaller year-on-year DSD impact, there's no question that our Q1 sales performance shows that our stepped-up brand building investment is starting to gain traction towards a return to top-line growth.","We also continued to improve our operating profit margin, as shown on slide 6. While our gross margin was down year-on-year, this was completely related to the DSD exit. Remember, with the exit from DSD, there are two factors that effectively reset our gross margins in U.S. Snacks. First, there's the downward adjustment to our selling price to reflect no longer charging for DSD services. And second, in a warehouse distribution model, logistics costs reside in COGS, whereas in a DSD model, they were in SG&A.","Excluding this dual impact from DSD, we held our gross margin year-on-year. This is a good performance, considering that we're experiencing the sharp rise in freight costs and other pressures that are being felt by many other companies. It reflects our ongoing productivity efforts, our savings for Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting and operating leverage for better top-line performance.","Operating profit margin increased by about 40 basis points year-on-year and this includes a substantial double-digit increase in brand building. This ramp up in brand building will continue in Q2 and even a bit into Q3. In fact, we made the decision recently to add some incremental brand building investment over the next couple of quarters, a testament to the quality of the commercial ideas being proposed and the positive impact it's already having on our top-line performance.","Rounding out the P&L, our interest expense increased because of debt related to acquiring RX, as well as a shift towards fixed rate debt. Other income declined as we lowered the expected return on assets assumptions for our pension plans, and our effective tax rate benefit from tax reform and a discrete benefit that only affects Q1. And finally, while Q1 is always the slowest quarter of the year for cash flow, it did increase year-on-year in Q1, even excluding the 2017 reclass for accounting changes, so good all-around performance from a financial perspective.","Slide 7 shows that we are affirming our full year 2018 guidance for our base business; that is, before the consolidation of our West Africa joint venture. We still expect net sales to be roughly flat on a currency-neutral basis. And there are no changes to the components of this outlook. RXBAR is still expected to contribute about 1 to 1.5 points of sales growth this year. On an organic basis, sales should be down about 1% to 2%, but within this outlook, remember that the DSD impact is still tracking to about down 1% for the full year.","Our forecast for adjusted operating profit remains plus 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis, even after adding incremental Brand Building investment to what was already a strong year-on-year increase. Adjusted gross margin comes down because of the DSD-related resets in U.S. Snacks, as we've discussed, but excluding this impact, we still believe our productivity and cost savings can offset cost inflation, including increased freight costs. And, of course, our overhead comes down significantly due to the DSD exit, other Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting.","We continue to project 9% to 11% growth in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, and this is off a recast 2017 base of $4 per share. Recall that this growth is driven by operating profit and by tax reform, net of a couple of negative items: higher interest expense year-on-year, because of debt related to the RX acquisition; and higher interest rates; and the negative impact on other income from a lowered return on asset assumptions on pension.","From a phasing standpoint, we expect Q2's operating profit, excluding the West Africa consolidation, to be flat to down year-on-year, owing to some possible sales timing from Q1 and an accelerated increase in Brand Building. This leaves our total first half at modest operating profit growth before it picks up in Q3 and Q4. Meanwhile, we make no change to our full year tax rate, so the remaining quarters' tax rates float up (11:33) after Q1's discrete tax benefit.","Cash flow is still expected to be roughly $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for our underlying business. I do want to point out that we are still contemplating a one-time $200 million to $300 million pre-tax contribution into our pension plans. This would bring down cash flow net of any related tax benefit, but it could also improve earnings. You will recall from our last quarter's earnings call that this is one of the options we were considering for deploying the tax reform cash benefits. And doing it this year means we could still deduct at the pre-reform tax rate, so it makes good financial sense. And we'll let you know when and if we take this opportunity.","Now, let's take a look at the financial implications of our increased investments in West Africa, as shown on slide 8. You'll recall that in late 2015, we entered into a relationship with Tolaram in Nigeria. As part of that initial investment, we acquired a 50% stake in Multipro, a major food distributor, and the call option to acquire an indirect stake in Dufil, a major food manufacturer.","We also set up a joint venture to manufacture and market cereal and snacks in West Africa and Kellogg noodles in the rest of Africa. The investment we're announcing today is simply a logical progression in this relationship. Specifically, we are investing about $420 million to exercise the call option for the stake in TAF, and to increase our stake in Multipro. These incremental investments had always been contemplated. And it was important, though, that we first learn the business and the market and develop our relationships with our partner, Tolaram. Obviously, we are very pleased with both. And Amit will take you through these businesses in more detail in a moment.","The transaction closed on May 2, and we will now consolidate the financials of Multipro, the distributor, into Kellogg's financials going forward. Among other things, this means that we'll see a lift to this year's net sales and operating profit. At current exchange rates, the total 2017 net sales of Multipro were equivalent to approximately $650 million, and its operating profit equated to over $35 million. This adds roughly 3 to 4 points to our currency-neutral net sales growth this year and more than a percentage point to our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense will go up modestly higher due to funding the investment. Below the tax line, our earnings from unconsolidated entities will no longer include Multipro's earnings, but it will benefit from our new stake in TAF, which includes earnings from the very profitable manufacturing company, Dufil. And on the separate lines for income attributable to noncontrolling interest, we'll now be deducting the minority interest of Multipro's.","Net of all of this, we'll see a very slight accretion to adjusted EPS this year. Over time, these investments will contribute to meaningful sales and earnings growth.","Obviously, being a distributor business, Multipro carries lower margins, particularly as we remain in an invest-and-expand role, but the growth is exceptional. And with net sales up more than 20% in Q1, none of this is cannibalistic to the rest of our business, we see continued potential. And, more importantly, this gives us an incredible route-to-market that helps us expand our brands across this region. Clearly, this raises the growth of our company.","So putting it all together, we get to our updated guidance, as shown on slide 9. Currency-neutral net sales growth gets a lift of 3 to 4 percentage points from Multipro, bringing our Kellogg Company guidance to plus 3% to 4% growth overall. Multipro adds another 1 to 2 points of adjusted operating profit growth, getting us to a 5% to 7% overall on a currency-neutral basis.","Together, the accretion of this investment and consolidation is relatively immaterial to adjusted EPS this year, as I mentioned. So our EPS guidance remains at a positive 9% to 11% on a currency-neutral basis, off the recast 2017 adjusted EPS base of $4 per share. Multipro will have an immaterial impact on our cash flow this year, so there's no change to that guidance.","With that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will give you an update on the performance and outlook of our Asia Pacific region overall and walk you through the strategic merits of this West Africa investment.","Amit Banati - Kellogg Co.","Thank you, Fareed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our West Africa investment, let me first review the results and outlook for our Asia Pacific region, shown on slide 10. We had a very good quarter. At 6%, our quarter one currency-neutral net sales growth continued a general acceleration that we have seen over the past year, as shown on the chart.","Driving this acceleration are three principal factors. The first is growth in emerging markets cereal and, more recently, wholesome snacks across Asia and Africa. We are seeing double-digit growth in markets like India, Southeast Asia, Korea and South Africa.","The second factor is our continued expansion of Pringles. In quarter one, we grew Pringles at a double-digit rate, led by growth in emerging markets. And this represented an acceleration from the mid-single-digit growth that the brand has been achieving consistently over the past two years.","The final factor is the stabilization of the region's core developed market, Australia. By focusing on the playbook we know wins in cereal, relevant food news combined with effective brand building and excellent in-store execution, we returned to share growth in 2017, and we continued to gain share in quarter one of 2018.","The combination of operating leverage from this strong top-line growth with productivity savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting, enabled us to increase brand building investment at a double-digit rate in the quarter and still deliver 17% operating profit growth as well as strong operating margin expansion.","And remember, these sales and profit results don't yet include any of our joint ventures. In quarter one, our joint venture in China delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, led once again by e-commerce, which is where we generate almost half of our cereal sales in that market. And in our JVs in West Africa, our quarter one growth was also double-digit once again, which is why we are so excited about our increased investment in these West Africa joint ventures.","A couple of years ago, we chose the joint venture structure because it was prudent from a capital at risk standpoint as we moved into a new market with a new partner. But as we got to know our partner, Tolaram, as we gained understanding of the business, and as we saw the great success of our combined business, it became very obvious that this is a long-term relationship worth investing in.","Before we get into the strategic merits of these investments, let me clarify the various entities, because I want to convey to you just how strong these assets and operations are. These are shown on slide 11. In each of these, our partner is Tolaram, which has over four decades of experience operating in Nigeria and West Africa.","Let's start with Multipro. We've owned a 50% stake in Multipro for the last couple of years, with Tolaram being the other key owner. Multipro is one of the largest distributors in Nigeria and Ghana, with about $650 million in annual sales at current exchange rates. It distributes Dufil's products as well as other brands.","What makes Multipro special is that it has an unrivalled distribution and logistics system in Nigeria, which enables availability of products across the country. It also has a powerful consumer activation capability, which has been a critical and proven enabler of building brands in this market. Particularly in emerging markets, there is nothing more important than your go-to-market, and Multipro is the best in that market.","By acquiring one-half of its holding company, Tolaram Africa Foods, we now have a stake in Dufil. This is a leading manufacturer and marketer of packaged foods in Nigeria and Ghana, including the number one brand of noodles. Dufil is a well-run company with excellent growth prospects and very strong profitability.","Finally, KT (sic) [KTNL] (20:34) is a separate joint venture that we have with Tolaram. It is focused on the manufacture and marketing of our cereal and snacks brands in West Africa, which it distributes through Multipro, as well as the manufacture and marketing of Kellogg's branded noodles in the rest of Africa.","In just two years, we have seen rapid expansion in this venture. More recently, we constructed a cereal plant in Nigeria for local production. And in quarter one, we successfully launched Kellogg's cereals, which are off to a very strong start. We also launched Kellogg's noodles into South Africa and Egypt. This venture is showing exciting prospects for growth.","As I said, we believe Tolaram is an excellent partner and that these are very high-quality assets. The combination of these entities provides us access to best-in-class distribution, brand building, supply chain and commercial execution capabilities. These are the right companies to build on, giving us a strong foothold in Nigeria, a market of 200 million consumers and the opportunity to expand into surrounding markets in West Africa and, ultimately, across Africa overall.","So let's see how these ventures fit into our broader Africa strategy, depicted on slide 12. This incremental investment is yet another leg in what is a pan-Africa strategy for the Kellogg Company, pursuing growth in a promising emerging market, one with high population growth, a youthful population and a growing middle class. And we're expanding across this continent from very advantaged positions.","We've already discussed West Africa and how we are building on the tremendous strength of Multipro and Dufil, but we are also expanding in the south and the north. We have had a solid long-standing presence in South Africa in cereal. In recent years, we added Pringles, which has been growing at a double-digit rate, so this is a good business with growth opportunity. And now, through our JV with Tolaram, we have launched breakfast noodles in South Africa under the Kellogg's brand, which is off to a strong start. So we're expanding in South Africa with a broader portfolio of affordable breakfast and snacks offerings.","In North Africa, we're not only expanding cereal and biscuits from our acquired operations in Egypt, but, through our Tolaram partnership, we're also launching breakfast noodles there and across other North Africa markets. So there is plenty of room for expansion in North Africa as well.","In short, we have added a partner and capability that enables us to expand the reach and awareness of the Kellogg brand throughout an emerging market region with excellent long-term growth prospects. Africa has become a tangible contributor to our emerging markets growth. And now, thanks to our most recent investment, you will be able to see this growth in our P&L.","So, in summary, Kellogg Asia Pacific continues to perform well, growing organically and delivering improved profitability. Today's increased investment in West Africa continues to fill in a broader Africa strategy that has us rapidly expanding noodles, cereals and Pringles across a promising emerging markets landscape, and doing it with the right partner. This raises our growth profile.","And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Steve.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Amit, very exciting times in your region. Let's move now to North America, where our largest business unit, U.S. Snacks, is shown on slide number 13. Now two and a half quarters into its post-DSD life, U.S. Snacks continues to show good progress. From a P&L perspective, the savings from eliminating DSD overhead are significantly exceeding the profit impacts of double-digit increases in brand building and the sales impact of SKU rationalization, and eliminating the price premium we once charged for providing DSD services. Simply put, we are realizing the financial benefits of this transition from DSD.","We're also making progress on the top line. If we strip out the mechanical net sales impact of the DSD exit, the SKU rationalization and the list price adjustments, U.S. Snacks' underlying net sales were up year-on-year, and this is the third consecutive quarter of growth, excluding the DSD exit impact.","We also like what we're seeing in the market. As we've stated previously, consumption and share declines were expected during the first year out of DSD, due to our significant reduction in SKUs and the reality of giving up secondary and tertiary displays, once we no longer have as frequent presence in stores by salespeople. But in Q1, our big three crackers brands collectively returned to consumption and share growth and Rice Krispies actually accelerated its growth.","Importantly, all of our major categories experienced year-on-year gains in velocity in Q1. Improving velocity is so elemental to what we're trying to do in our transition from DSD that we're updating this graph for you. Look at the tremendous improvement we are making here now that we have a stronger set of SKUs on the shelf, and that we are supporting these SKUs and brands with sufficient brand building.","I should also mention Pringles, which was never in DSD to begin with, but is benefiting from the investment dollars and management focus freed up by the DSD exit, not to mention the capability to now run cross-category promotions with former DSD brands. In Q1, Pringles boosted its consumption and share via our successful Flavor Stacking campaign, involving both media and in-store activation and via big promotional events with Cheez-It. So we're off to a good start in U.S. Snacks. We continue to expect improving in-market performance supported by strong increases in brand building investment.","Now, let's turn to U.S. Morning Foods in slide number 14. Morning Foods posted a sales decline that represented improvement from recent quarters, cutting in half our decline from 2017, and it was actually a little ahead of our expectations. Aggressive competitor promotion in the kid-oriented segment held back some of our brands in that segment, but we did make progress on what we had prioritized, food news and brand communication on the adult-oriented health and wellness segment.","As a result, Special K returned to consumption and share growth, owing to communication around its new inner strength positioning. Similarly, Mini-Wheats, Raisin Bran and Rice Krispies all started to improve their trends in the quarter, as we renewed communication about their key wellness attributes. These efforts will pick up in Q2 when we increase investment behind this communication and tie it to food news.","We recognize that we have more work to do. In addition to the communication in food news and health and wellness, we are responding to competitor activity in the kid-oriented segment with innovation, including support for our new Chocolate Frosted Flakes, a recent launch that has been well received and a new product launch for Froot Loops.","Additionally, we are launching bagged formats for certain brands in this segment, seeking to widen our consumer base. Pop-Tarts, too, will benefit from innovation and brand support as we head into the second half.","For Morning Foods this year, it's all about getting back to basics. Under new management for this unit, we've been reassessing our shopper segmentation, our brand promise and our investment levels across the portfolio. We've been honing our execution and working on building an innovation pipeline that is exciting and differentiated. We still expect to see profit pressured by increased investment this year, but with a continued moderation in sales declines as we work towards stabilizing this business. We've got a lot of work to do, but we're making progress.","Turning to slide number 15, U.S. Specialty Channels continued to post net sales growth despite not one, but two years of difficult comps on its way to its 11th straight quarter of top-line growth. We recorded strong growth in most of our channels. Vending was up strongly. Convenience posted good growth. And Girl Scouts had another good season. Foodservice posted a modest decline, albeit against a good year earlier growth.","As we had signaled on our last quarterly earnings call, Specialty Channels operating profit in 2018 is forecast to be uncharacteristically down year-on-year, due to changes we made this year in the allocation of costs from other U.S. segments. This is not related to any change in the underlying business, which remains solid. We think Specialty Channels is on track to deliver another year of steady top-line growth.","Let's turn to slide number 16, our North America Other segment, which turned in exceptional net sales and operating profit growth. The acquisition of RX drove a lot of this net sales growth. In its first full quarter since being added to our portfolio last October, RX is tracking to its aggressive 2018 plan. In Q1, net sales were up significantly. Consumption grew significantly and share was up significantly. The brand continued to expand distribution within existing channels and into new ones. We're already realizing the benefits of not only treating RX as a stand-alone growth platform, but also allowing it to tap into Kellogg resources, particularly R&D and supply chain. Needless to say, we're very pleased with its performance so far and we have exciting plans for this growth platform.","Even excluding RX, the North America Other segment still grew net sales organically at a high single-digit rate. This was due to outstanding momentum in our frozen foods brands. On trend with consumers, frozen foods categories are outpacing grocery overall, especially with millennials, who consider frozen closest to fresh and who prize its convenience and value.","And we play in two very promising areas. As shown on the chart, both Eggo and MorningStar Farms sustained double-digit consumption growth in Q1. Both brands have benefited from renovated food and packaging, new innovations and commercial focus on core offerings. We expect Frozen Foods to continue to grow, even as it begins to lap its year-ago acceleration, in coming quarters.","Rounding out the segment, Kashi Company continued to drive strong consumption growth and share gains for Bear Naked Granola while working to stabilize Kashi brands cereal and snacks outside the natural channel.","In Canada, the cereal category softened in the quarter, but we continued to gain share, led by health and wellness-oriented brands like Special K and Mini-Wheats. We also grew consumption in wholesome snacks, Pringles and frozen waffles. Overall, we expect continued growth for North America Other, led by RX's continued expansion and Frozen Foods' growth.","Europe is on slide number 17 and it, too, had a good quarter. Growth was again led by Pringles, which continued to rebound from last year's disruption of normal promotions in some markets. It turned in double-digit growth here in Q1, and it continued to grow across the region, well beyond those markets that had experienced last year's disruption. This brand is in good shape and we have even stronger commercial plans ahead, including a very big soccer tie-in. Our cereal trends continue to improve. This has been led by the stabilization of our UK cereal business, which in Q1 delivered year-on-year increases in consumption, share and net sales.","In the UK, Special K turned in its second consecutive quarter of year-on-year consumption and share growth, accelerating from last quarter. And this key brand also turned positive in markets like Spain and Italy, demonstrating that its new positioning and reinvestment are starting to take hold.","We should mention that emerging markets were a driver of the Europe region's growth for both cereal and snacks. This was led by both Egypt and Russia, so Europe is back to growth this year. Markets remain challenging, particularly in Continental Europe, but we've gotten off to a good start and we have good plans in place for the rest of the year.","Let's finish with Latin America on slide number 18. Operating profit was pulled down, as expected, by the negative impact of forex rates on cost of goods sold. This reflected prior hedges rolling off and the business is on track for operating profit growth for the full year. Importantly, Latin America resumed top-line growth in Q1 after a 2017 held down by the Caribbean\/Central America markets. Recall that in those markets, we experienced, first, a trade inventory overhang, and then, devastating hurricanes. The good news is that declines in these markets continued to moderate in Q1, even as stores in Puerto Rico struggle to reopen.","But it was Mexico and Mercosur that drove Latin America's growth in the quarter. Mexico posted its eighth straight quarter of organic net sales growth. Our snack sales growth in this key market continues to be led by Pringles, and we grew cereal, too, in net sales, consumption and in share.","In the Mercosur markets, we posted double-digit net sales growth, driven by cereal, Pringles and Parati. Parati is clearly a boost for our business in Brazil, where we are leveraging its presence and expertise in high-frequency stores, while sustaining its growth in biscuits. So Latin America is another area in which we are seeing progress.","So to summarize on slide number 19, we are Deploying for Growth, and you can see signs of progress. You can see progress in our strong start to the year. Not only did we grow, but we saw improving top-line and in-market performance in key areas of our portfolio. And not only did we expand our operating profit margin, we did it in the face of cost headwinds and a very strong increase in brand building. It's so critical to get off to a good start because it creates flexibility and confidence for the rest of the year.","We're making progress on the quality and quantity of consumer-oriented ideas surfacing throughout the organization. With much of the heavy lifting behind us on our cost structure reduction efforts of recent years, we're getting more commercially creative, and we're putting more money behind it. Brand building was up substantially year-on-year in Q4 of 2017. It was up substantially in Q1 of 2018, and it will be again through at least Q2 of this year.","We are on track to deliver our full year guidance, and that's even with us leaning into incremental reinvestment. And we've taken further steps forward in our commitment to shape our portfolio toward growth. RX is expanding and giving us a new growth platform. Parati has tripled the size of our business in Brazil and is giving us new opportunities for revenue and cost synergies. And today's announcement of an increased investment in our West Africa partnerships shouldn't be taken lightly. Africa is a big, promising growth opportunity, and we are making an investment that will lift our growth rates for a long time.","Finally, as shown on our Deploy for Growth graphic, our people are our competitive advantage. So we'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work.","And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Morning, David.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Morning.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Wanted to ask you about your top line. So sales outperformed our expectations in the quarter. You said the brand building is working. Why not upside to the revenue forecast this year? And then a follow-up, if I may.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question, David. I think we're pleased, obviously, very pleased with the top-line start to the year in Q1, but we're taking a prudent view because it is just one quarter behind us. I'm seven months into the role right now, so we think it's just smart to be prudent, but having said that, we are pleased.","We're seeing good growth, as I mentioned, in Pringles, in Eggo, in MorningStar Farms, in RX, and Bear Naked. Those are all in North America, which in the past has been a bit challenging. Then we've got the emerging markets, Asia really firing on all cylinders, Mexico, Brazil and now West Africa. So making very good progress across our top line, which gives us very good confidence that we'll deliver the year, but we just think, at this stage, it's smart to be prudent. And we will reinvest. We will lean in where we see opportunities. We've given ourselves some flexibility to do that.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then, my follow-up is just related to volume, up a strong 3% in the quarter. This historically has had a nice positive effect on margins because of the leverage that you get through your manufacturing facilities. Can you talk about the effect in the quarter? And secondly, do you think that you'll have volume leverage through the facilities for the full year?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, I'll start and then let Fareed build on it, but we're pleased with our margins, so if you take out the DSD impact, margins are flat to down ever-so-slightly in the quarter, and that's with increased brand building which I mentioned. And it's also covering significant freight costs, which we're able to cover thanks to the outstanding work that was done in our supply chain. I really tip my hat to our supply chain colleagues. Factories are running very efficiently, very effectively. They're looking at productivity in every corner to overcome some of the headwinds that we've had in order to give the margin performance that we've given. Fareed, do you want to...?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, the only thing I'd add is that on the cost pressures, where we're seeing it most acutely is on freight, like many other companies, and a combination of specific productivity initiatives that we have in place, as part of Project K, as part of our ongoing productivity efforts, that's offsetting it. And the volume flowing through our plants really does create some leverage as well, so you put all that together, that generated flat gross profit in Q1. And we expect that type of performance to continue for the full year because we do have visibility on those initiatives.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it along.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. So just a question on the double-digit brand building investment, can you just kind of break out where you think how that was deployed across snacks, cereal, U.S., emerging markets in Q1? And then, just kind of expectations for the rest of the year as you look at the business and the growth opportunity and you lean in a little incrementally, where do you see most of the investment going or is it just essentially broadly based? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks, David, for the question. I'll start again and Fareed can add, as he sees fit. First, I guess from a very top-line perspective, we're not going to give any great detail about where we're deploying our investments, for competitive reasons. We always had plans, which we articulated, to put more brand building against snacks in the U.S., post-DSD as we move from a push environment to a pull environment. So you see quite a lot of the investment going there. We had a fantastic first quarter promotion in Pringles and Cheez-It leveraged around the Super Bowl, which saw very good momentum.","In emerging markets, we see good opportunities to continue to invest as we think forward-looking, but it's fairly broad-based with the biggest chunk, I would say, coming in U.S. Snacks as we continue to successfully transition out of a DSD environment into a pull environment.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","And what I'd add is just a reminder, last year, as we were going through the DSD transition, we pulled back a little bit around the first half as we went through the DSD transition, just to basically keep the outlook fairly stable on the businesses. So there's going to be year-on-year acceleration that's pretty significant in the first half. The full year will be up.","And the only thing other I'll add is we continue to make great progress on looking at ROIs on our brand building investments. And so, these are pretty precise bets around very specific brands and channels and media, and we're seeing good response. And we'll continue to take a targeted approach. But so far, we like what we see and we can make those kind of investments and watch the returns, very short cycle times.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Super. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just one question on sort of the relative growth that you're seeing in the portfolio, it's interesting how in these categories in snacks and cereals, we're seeing the sweet or fun flavor-type brands doing among the best and seemingly, they're more receptive to innovation and promotion. And you're doing nice job with Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts, to perhaps feeding into this, offsetting some declines in your wellness bar brands. But on the cereal side, you seem to be still dug in around the wellness news.","And I know you're making some adjustments. You mentioned Chocolate Frosted Flakes and something with Froot Loops, but are you seeing the results from pushing on wellness within cereal or is your best hand perhaps pivoting and going more the fun route within that category? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question, David. A couple things, first, in terms of health and wellness, we are seeing actually good progress against Special K. And that's in all the markets including United States, so we don't think that that's an inappropriate area for us to focus in. Having said that, we've got a wide portfolio with lots of choice, including kind of kid-oriented brands that you mentioned, as well as health and wellness brands, and we see opportunities across the breadth of our portfolio. And clearly, we've got strong brands in all those categories.","In the kid categories, obviously, Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops play very well. We think there are opportunities for new innovations and new ideas there. We've got Chocolate Frosted Flakes, which is doing very well in the market. We've got a new Froot Loops innovation coming. So I would posit that it's well balanced across our portfolio, because the investments we've made to turn Special K have been pleasing to us.","And in terms of wellness overall, and you mentioned bars, RXBAR plays in this space and is really growing at a torrid pace. They're doing such a great job at RX, and we're incredibly proud of the work that they're doing. It's really focused. It's very innovative. It's very brand-centric. It really targets the consumer in a meaningful way and is showing great growth for us.","So, we've got a broad portfolio across health and wellness and snacking and kids. And we invest where we see the best returns, where we see the best potential. So it's not just in one particular area. And I hope that's helpful.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That is. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks so much. I just wanted to drill down on a couple of the products. First, your mention of bagged cereals, would you be characterizing or thinking about that in terms of kind of brand investment or is that sort of more kind of capitulation to market trends?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Tim. Capitulation is not a word we like to use around here. Having said that...","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Copy that. Sorry. Yeah. (44:50)","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","I'm just kidding. In terms of bagged cereal, it really broadens our consumer base, right? So, we go to where the consumer is. We try and get there in front of the consumer sometimes, but when the consumer goes somewhere, we tend to want to really give the consumer what they're looking for. And there is an element of the consumer that is looking for bagged cereal. We're not the first there, but we've seen \u2013 actually, the research that we've done, it tends to be highly incremental. And so, we are going to go into bagged cereal.","Having said that, you asked about investment. We don't necessarily invest behind a packaging format. We invest behind our brands and then offer different packaging formats, different solutions to our customers across a broad array of channels and packages. And so, it's just one of the innovations that we're coming out with when the new product launches that we're coming out with this year.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yes. And then just on Pringles. I mean, I think it's fair to say that even excluding the discontinuities last year, the brand is probably doing better, maybe better than you expected, and it's doing quite well. What would you attribute that to? Is that some of the media around the Super Bowl? Is there anything you can really point to or \u2013 leaving aside the comp issues, that we're all familiar with.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","I think it starts with a good idea, and they had a good idea around Flavor Stacking, which drove multiple purchases because the whole idea is you stack different Pringles flavors on top of each other to create different food type occasions. And it had good communication in the marketplace. The highest profile was the Super Bowl commercial, but it was a full 360-degree digital social approach to it and really drove good consumption, good share, good velocity.","And so, we know if you have a good brand and then you have a good commercial idea and you follow that with excellent execution in the marketplace, which the team did \u2013 they drove significant improvement in not only the number of displays on the floor, but the size and the location of those displays. And so, it was all of those things. And it's much like all of our portfolio in the branded business, when you have good innovation, good ideas, strong commercial execution, really focused on the consumer and the customer to give the customer excellent customer service and execute at retail, good things tend to happen. And Pringles was a good example of the team executing well.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Terrific. Thanks for your help.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just had a...","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Morning, Chris","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just had a question for you. In relation to \u2013 when you're talking about brand building, I'm just curious to what degree that includes promotional spending. And just trying to understand, I realize what's going on in the DSD system, but we saw it up in Europe, for example. Is that an element of your incremental spending in the quarter? And I guess it sounds like you're seeing some pretty good results, certainly on the volume side, so I'm curious about that as well.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","No. When we talk brand building, we're not talking about trade. So we're talking about bottom line brand building, period.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So trade spending was up as well, even beyond what happened in DSD. Was that planned? Is that expected to continue through the year? I'm just curious about that level of spending.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, so it's Fareed. That spend is very much brand-specific. I would say if you ex the DSD, there's really no material increase. So the main change was DSD for trade.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just a quick question, the profit margin in U.S. Snacks was well above our estimate. Is there a shift in expenses there helping that? And is there anything to the level of spending in the quarter that may have caused that margin to be higher? I'm just trying to get a sense of how that phases through the year.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","I'm sorry. Can you re-ask that? I didn't really catch your question.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The profit margin on U.S. Snacks, it looks like it was quite strong. Is there a shift in expenses that helped that? I'm just trying to get a sense of how that phases through the year, based on your investments behind that business as well, and there's a lot going on with the DSD system there.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, it \u2013 Fareed, go ahead.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","There is a lot going on. The most significant impact is going to be the whole shift out of the DSD system which flowed through overhead, and some of that gets offset by increase in COGS as it goes through the network. But net-net, significant savings dropped to the bottom line, and that's even with the increased investments in brand building.","And we talked about the Snacks operating profit going up to the average of our North America business, which is a pretty significant lift, and we are right on track to accomplish that. So the DSD savings are flowing through as we had expected, and you'll see that business continue to perform very strongly on operating profit this year.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. Good morning. Steve, I'm curious as to the strategy behind MorningStar. That's a brand that really has dominant share and some good name recognition, but it also seems like Kellogg's never really put a full-fledged effort behind it. I mean, there's been talk about RXBAR being a platform for you, but how do you think about MorningStar being a platform and your ability to stretch that into plant-based more broadly?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. I'll tell you, MorningStar Farms is a star in our portfolio. We believe that. It's up double-digit in consumption in the first quarter and is really gaining momentum. And the momentum really started last summer, when the team really started to focus on the core attributes of the brand and did some excellent execution around commercial ideas. So we believe actually there's great potential in MorningStar Farms.","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the millennial generation really thinks about frozen differently than other generations. It's kind of the new fresh and the new convenient. You couple that then with the whole veggie approach to this, and it's right on-trend. So we believe in the brand. We believe it has great potential. There's innovations that you'll see coming from the MorningStar Farms team. And so we agree with you. We think it's right on-trend, a very good brand. It's being executed well, and it's got a lot of future potential.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Do you see an opportunity to move it more broadly into Europe or the UK?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Potentially.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for your time.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. So on the leverage side, you're obviously injecting a decent chunk of change into the new West African expansion, and I think you've alluded to additional contributions to the pensions as well. What do you expect the leverage to go to, I guess, as of now and if you were to do the pension thing as well?","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","So our goal is to remain strongly investment grade, and so that's sort of a foundational element of our strategy. We will flex up for attractive acquisitions. I would say everything we're doing has been thought through and planned in Nigeria. Investments were very much a natural extension, and then with the option window coming into sight, we were really planning for that. So, yes, our leverage will go up a little bit, but we'll continue to focus on bringing that down, finding the right balance between dividend, debt reduction, and return of capital in various forms.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And as a quick follow-up, on the other income line, I'm assuming that about $25 million of that $70 million is the mark-to-market pension-related line that gets excluded from adjusted earnings. Is the remaining $45 million mostly the expected return on pension assets that is included in the adjusted numbers? And just philosophically, why would that be included in the adjusted numbers, because it's non-cash and really just not part of the ongoing operations? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Alexia, I'm not sure I'm completely following that. So mark-to-market is not in our adjusted numbers. So maybe we could follow-up and just so I can understand the question a little bit better as a follow-up.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","It was really the other part, not the $25 million, but the remaining other income, is that mostly expected returns on pension?","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yes.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yes, it would be, right. And so, as part of our thinking around pension, we are contemplating a de-risk of the pension plan to shifting our asset mix a little bit and, therefore, bringing down our assumptions about the return on our assets just to be more prudent. And so coupled with the contribution to the pension, which, again, that's deductible at the pre tax reform rate, so it's a nice soft of financial outcome.","So we end up with a contribution that's accelerated to our pension plans. It puts the funding status in a very nice spot. And recall, that the largest portions of our plans are already frozen, and then sort of shifting the portfolio allocation to de-risk that a little bit as well. We've had nice returns on that portfolio with our current allocation, but as we look at the market, this feels like the prudent thing to do. So hopefully that gets at the question.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, I guess the only follow-up is why would you include that in the adjusted numbers, the expected return? I think most companies don't do that.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","It's always been there. It's been very consistent and it's always been in the numbers.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. I have two questions. One is I was just trying to do a little bit of math on the contribution of the Africa business. Based on the sales contribution and operating profit, I got a mid-single-digit operating profit margin for that business. Can you tell me if I'm off on that? But if that is the margin, what can you do to help those businesses improve their margin structure?","And secondly, on the second half of the year, I think you have some tougher comparisons to inventory loading on the Snacks business during the DSD transition. Can you give us a sense of what kind of headwind that poses to sales? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Robert, thanks for the question. I'll make one comment and then turn it over to Fareed. And the only comment I'd make is as you think about West Africa, what we really have here, what we're really investing in, is a total business system, right? The Multipro investment, which is maybe a 5%, 6% to 7% margin, is a capability that is outstanding and is a route-to-market that is best-in-class in West Africa, which allows our branded businesses and the JVs that manufacture our branded businesses, get to market in a way that is truly advantaged. So it's a total system that we have here, not just the one investment in Multipro.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, and what I'd add is it's a distribution business but they bring a tremendous amount of value-added services as well, so don't just think a logistics company. It's a really unique asset in that market. And so there's a lot of promotion and trial. They bring a lot of services because the retail environment is extraordinarily fragmented and local. So you have Multipro that brings a lot of services and so their operating profit margins look a lot more attractive than you might consider, say, a developed market distribution business. And I think that's sort of mid to low singles. And that's including the investments that they're making as they grow the business.","The other joint ventures that we have, whether it's cereal or with Dufil, those tend to have very attractive margins and they look very similar to what you might see in a development market from an OP delivery standpoint. And again, this is a bet on Africa and the growth that's there. Going with distribution first really allows you to time the subsequent investments in a much more precise way and a risk-adjusted way. And again, we're looking at the businesses sort of together and the big opportunity here is to tap the market potential.","You'd also mentioned, just on the second part of the question, about the balance of the year and how we sort of compare that to priors. What I'll say is that in Q2 of last year in the Snacks business as part of the DSD transition, that was the quarter where we began to see the pipeline fill. So recall, that we had two distribution businesses, one that we were operating to serve customers and the other one that we were putting inventory in to be ready for the transition.","So in Q2, we actually had pipeline fill. We also had the beginnings of the SKU rationalizations and the risk price adjustments but if you put that all together, the Q2 DSD headwind, if you will, on sales was not as significant as in the latter quarter. So that makes Q2 a tougher comp for our Snacks business, and that sort of factors into some of the guidance that we gave you, where we don't see Q2 top-line growth as strongly because of that prior-year impact. And in terms of delev (58:28) basically, most of the dust has settled on the DSD transition, and I think for the Snacks business, we're in pretty good shape going forward.","John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.","Operator, we only have time for one quick last question.","Operator","And that question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I'll be quick. Steve, you have talked in the past at CAGNY about your admiration for the frozen category. You're talking about it again today. One question I would have \u2013 and I think John Baumgartner sort of asked a little bit about this earlier, but are you under scale in frozen? And the reason I'm asking is so many other companies out there talk about the need for scale in this category, just given the high fixed costs. You guys have one major brand, one more minor one in terms of size. If it's such a great category, do you need to or is there an optionality there where you could potentially buy your way into a little more scale, which you could then leverage for some synergies there? I'm just trying to think about your strategy along those lines.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Ken. I am bullish on our Frozen business, proud of what the team has done there, and I don't think we're disadvantaged in scale in any way because both brands are growing at double digits. So we like the scale. It's not to say that we wouldn't think about opportunities to scale up, but right now, we've got plans in place to really grow these businesses in meaningful ways that contribute to the top line and bottom line of the company. So we're proud of what the team's done and think it's in very good shape right now.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But wait. And that's fair, but it's less about the top line growth than it is about the cost line, right? The scale question is talking about fixed cost leverage across more revenues. That's more what I was asking about.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, right now, we've got good leverage with our businesses growing double digits. Our factory's pretty full. The question of scale oftentimes is what type of capacity utilization you have in your various plants. And right now, this business is operating pretty well.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","(60:36)","Operator","Go ahead, sir.","John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.","I'm afraid we're out of time, but if anyone has any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12336":["Kellogg (NYSE:K) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 31, 2014  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Simon Burton - Executive Officer of Snacks business unit","John A.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Simon Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations for Kellogg Company. Mr. Burton, you may begin your call.","Simon Burton","Thanks, Laura, and good morning. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today for a review of our second quarter 2014 results. I'm joined here by John Bryant, Chairman and CEO; and Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer. The press release and slides to support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kelloggcompany.com. As you're aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to our -- to the second slide of our presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, August 4. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days. And I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we announced second quarter earnings per share that were broadly in line with our expectations. We saw growth in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and in Specialty Channels in the U.S., and Pringles continue to do well around the world. However, as you've heard from other companies recently, the sales environment continues to be very difficult in major developed markets, and this affected our performance in the second quarter as well. As a result, sales growth and operating profit were lower than we anticipated. However, earnings per share were broadly in line with expectations in a challenging environment. As Ron will discuss in more detail in a few minutes, as a result of the environment we've seen so far this year, we're lowering our guidance for 2014. We now expect that internal net sales will be down between 1% and 2%. Underlying internal operating profit will be down between 1% and 3%, and a currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will be between up 1% and down 1%. We are disappointed by our performance in 2014 and are committed to returning our business to long-term growth. We already invest a significant $1.5 billion a year in brand building, an industry-leading level as a percentage of sales. And as you know, we intend to increase our investment in revenue-driving activities, including brand building and sales execution as part of the Project K initiative. But before we talk about that in more detail, let me turn to Slide 4 and a brief overview of Project K and how we're funding the extra investment. Project K is our 4-year global efficiency and effectiveness program, and it continues to progress well. As you know, Project K is designed to ensure that we have the right capacity in the right locations to enable us to meet customer demand and market trends. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to close our London, Ontario cereal plants and are in consultation to take production out of that plant in Manchester, U.K. Despite these actions, we may still have more capacity than we need in our cereal network. In addition to the items we've discussed with you previously, we recently announced that we have plans to reduce excess capacity in the snacks business in the U.S. Also, as we highlighted last quarter, the move to global business services continues to go well. This is a three-tiered model, which will include local, regional and global services. We remain on track to open the first regional center, which will support North America in the third quarter of this year, and we've announced our intention to open a center in Europe.","Let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of some of the actions we are taking with the savings generated by this program. We currently invest in advertising at industry-leading levels and have so for some years. Part of that is due to the categories in which we compete, as they are large, profitable and highly branded. So while we intend to continue to increase investment over the long term, at or above the rate of sales growth, we are also taking steps in the near term to increase the effectiveness and impact of the $1.5 billion we currently invest in brand building. First, we have a portfolio of strong brand equities, and we'll continue to nurture and enhance their relevance through the use of strong campaign ideas that differentiate and break through. For example, we're driving the relevance of the Kellogg's parent brand with consumers by communicating about our sustainability initiatives and philanthropic initiatives, such as Breakfast for Better Days. We know that consumers are looking for companies that share their values, and these campaigns demonstrate our commitment to the environment and the community. Second, in a fragmented media landscape, we are focused on following the consumer as their immediate consumption habits evolve. Today, we invest more than 20% of our media in digital properties, and we will continue to shift media to where and when the consumer engages for the greatest impact. Third, as many consumers seek personalized one-to-one communication, we will continue to expand our database of over 20 million consumers in the U.S. and reach out to them with personalized communications and offers on the brands of their choice. Finally, recognizing we are competing in a multicultural landscape, we are actively engaging the Hispanic audience. So we're focusing on new investment and on increasing the effectiveness of what we already spend. We see this as a meaningful opportunity. We will continue to evaluate all of our spending and generate great ideas that will drive profitable revenue growth. And I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 6 shows financial results for the second quarter. Internal sales declined by 1.5%, an improvement from the first quarter, but below our expectations. We had anticipated some improvement in developed cereal trends during the quarter, and our U.S. snacks business was softer than planned, but we did post good growth in other regions, including Latin America, Asia and Europe. Underlying internal operating profit decreased by 7.2%, which as John said, was below our expectations. This was due to our sales performance. It's also worth noting that our profit performance included a mid-single-digit increase in investment in brand building, the benefit of a lower overhead in SG&A and slightly higher inflation in cost of goods sold. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration cost, mark-to-market adjustments and Project K costs, were $1.02 per share in the quarter, broadly in line with our expectations. We benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate, lower interest expense and by $0.02 per share from currencies. Reported earnings per share for the quarter were $0.82, including $0.02 of Pringles integration costs, $0.16 of upfront costs related to Project K and $0.02 impact from mark-to-market adjustments.","Slide 7 shows the composition of the second quarter sales growth. Total internal sales declined by 1.5%, and total price and mix improved by 1%, with most regions contributing to the performance. Volume decreased by 2.5% in the quarter, mainly due to declines in developed cereal. As was the case last quarter, unit volume performance was better than tonnage. Finally, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales growth by 0.7% in the quarter, primarily as the result of movement in the British pound.","Now let's turn to Slide 8, which shows our underlying reported gross profit and gross margin for the quarter. Our underlying gross margin decreased by 60 basis points in the second quarter. Our inflation is more skewed to earlier in the year. In addition, we saw some adverse impact from higher distribution costs and lower production volume due to our sales performance across the quarter. While we generated solid productivity savings in the quarter, we experienced some net inflation. And these factors led to the decline in gross margin that we saw in the quarter. We are currently covered on commodities and packaging at approximately 90%. So we have good visibility into the phasing and levels of cost for the year.","Slide 9 shows the quarterly internal operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's internal operating profit decreased by 9%. This was driven by lower-than-expected sales in cereal, increased transportation costs, and we also increased investment and brand building in the period. We expect improvement in the second half of the year in North America, although we expect operating profit to be down for the year. Internal operating profit in Europe increased by 5%. Sales and strong productivity savings and cost of goods sold and overhead led to net deflation in the quarter, so as partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in brand building investment, including for our cereal category building messaging. Internal operating profit grew 6% in Latin America. We had good top line growth, which helped to offset inflation in cost of goods sold. Top line growth was driven in part by a lower impact in the food tax increase in Mexico earlier this year. And Asia Pacific posted a decrease in internal operating profit of 65% in the quarter. This was largely due to a double-digit increase in brand building investment across the region and our performance in South Africa. In South Africa, we conducted construction in our plant, and it took longer to bring production back online than we planned. This increased our cost of goods sold and impacted our ability to supply the market. It is important to note, however, that the plant is up and running again. Slide 10 shows year-to-date cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $654 million. We continue to make progress on the payables initiative that we've discussed with you previously, and we still expect that this initiative would generate between $200 million and $300 million in cash this year. Also, we are investigating some other options that can improve working capital even further in the years to come. Year-to-date capital spending was $226 million, slightly lower than last year, but our expectations for full year capital spending remain unchanged between 4% and 5% of sales to support Project K's supply network initiatives, capacity expansion for Pringles and our new cereal plant in India. So year-to-date free cash flow after capital spending was $428 million.","And finally, share repurchases in the first half of the year were $329 million, significantly more than the $124 million of options proceeds received. We now expect to reduce our average share count by approximately 1.5% over the course of the year towards the lower end of our previous outlook.","Now let's turn to slide 11, which shows our revised guidance for 2014. As usual, our guidance excludes items that affect comparability, and please refer to our notes for the details on these items. As a result of a slower improvement in sales trends, we have revised our outlook for the year. We now expect that internal net sales will be lower by between 1% and 2% for the full year. This is primarily due to the softer sales performance we've seen in our developed cereal markets in the first half. We expect moderate material-related inflation for the year, and total cost of goods sold inflation is still expected to be in the 3% to 4% range we provided previously. Productivity and savings from Project K will be a little higher than we guided, leading to moderate net deflation for the year. We do still expect an improvement in underlying reported gross margin, but it may be up only slightly. We anticipate that underlying internal operating profit will be in a range between down 1% and down 3%, and we continue to expect the brand building to be at or above the rate of sales growth. This outlook excludes the impact of the 53rd week, which will add between 1.5 and 2 points to reported operating profit growth. Currency-neutral comparable earnings are expected be in a range between down 1% and up 1% or $3.81 to $3.89 per share. The 53rd week will add approximately $0.07 per share, and currency may add approximately $0.03 per share, resulting in an EPS including the 53rd week in currencies of $3.91 to $3.99. The tax rate is still expected to be between 29% and 30%, and interest expense is now anticipated to be between $210 million and $220 million. The EPS walk on slide 12 shows you the details of our guidance. Our outlook still excludes any potential impact from a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. If we were to recognize the devaluation to the SICAD 1 rate now, it could impact earnings by between $0.07 and $0.09 per share for 2014. The annualized impact would be between $0.09 and $0.11 per share due to the translation of profits at a lower rate for an entire year. And finally, on this slide, we continue to estimate that integration costs will be between $0.07 and $0.09 a share, and that Project K costs may be at the high end of the $0.60 to $0.65 per share range.","Now let's turn to slide 13. We expect cash flow to be at the low end of the range between $1 billion and $1.1 billion due to our expectations for lower full year underlying internal operating profit. And as I said earlier, we still expect capital spending to be between 4% and 5% of sales. As you would expect, our revised outlook for the year has an impact on our expectations for second half sales and profit. While we anticipate that both internal sales and underlying internal operating profit will be down in the third quarter, and we expect comparable earnings per share to be down at a mid-single-digit rate, including continued investment in brand-building activities. Our sales trends are expected to improve as we progress into the fourth quarter, and we expect growth in underlying internal operating profit, including the benefit from the build of productivity savings, including Project K and the lower inflation I mentioned. And of course, we've also got the 53rd week affecting earnings per share as well. And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail on the operating segments.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Now if you'll turn to Slide 14, you'll see more detail regarding Morning Foods. Internal net sales declined by 4.9% in the quarter. As you know, we started our category-building programs in the second quarter. This investment will continue across the balance of the year and into the future, with a focus on evening snacking beginning in the fourth quarter. And to be clear, this is not just an idea or 2. Rather, it is an ongoing initiative to deliver our consumer-focused message on both a category and individual brand level. And it won't surprise you to hear that we are putting the final touches on a campaign that we'll launch in early 2015 as well. As we drive this program, it is designed to build and grow the category and for Kellogg to capture that growth. We will do that by using our individual brands within the category-building campaigns. So as you think about the business, we have distinct challenges with some valid innovation, with Special K and with Kashi, and we have plans to each. While Mini-Wheats has posted declines in consumption so far this year, the original bite-size version has performed relatively well. The overall decline has been largely due to innovation that hasn't worked, such as Mini-Wheats Crunch, but we're working through that impact. As you can see on the slide, the broader category-building campaign includes the Mini-Wheats brand. And we've also got new advertising planned for later in the year, which focuses on out-of-breakfast consumption. So we're strengthening our brand-building program on Mini-Wheats, and are confident that this is a brand that will respond, that we return to growth over time. And we've also had an issue with some other failed innovation in Crunchy Nut and FiberPlus. In fact, the impact of these 2 brands accounts the 0.5 point per share decline in the quarter. While the category trends were not positive, we also faced some brand-specific issues. Special K continues to be impacted by the evolving consumer trends affecting weight management brands in general. As a result, we are actively repositioning the brand and emphasizing the presence of positive nutrition like protein, fiber, grains and other relevant nutritional benefits. We also have plans for renovation and innovation, as well as new communication plans to further drive this repositioning of the food.","Finally, for Morning Foods, let's turn to Slide 15 in Kashi, which is one of the largest natural food businesses in the U.S. Kashi has not performed as well as we would have liked over the past few years. And while much of the recent decline is due to lower distribution, we need to address the brand's positioning and our ability to execute quickly enough in the evolving world of natural and organic foods. We haven't kept Kashi focused enough on progressive nutrition. And as a result, we have decided to make some dramatic changes. David Denholm, who ran Kashi very successfully in the 2000s, is returning to the company to become CEO of the Kashi Company, which also includes the Bare Naked and Stretch Island Fruit snack businesses. This will be a largely autonomous business within the Kellogg family. Kashi will be based in La Jolla, where it began, and will be focused on returning the brand to the leading edge of the natural and organic food world. This business requires an entrepreneurial approach, shorter developed periods and a more agile decision-making process. And David is the right person to lead this significant change, although we know it will take some time. So as we said before, we realize an improvement of the cereal business will take some time. However, we've just started to invest in all our developed businesses around the world, and we're making plans for additional activities. This is a multiyear program, and we're confident that we have the foods, the brands and the ideas to drive improvement in the future.","Now let's look at the U.S. Snacks segment in Slide 16. Internal net sales declined by 2.7% in the quarter. The cracker business and Pringles both did well in the quarter, and we maintained share with the Keebler brand in the cookie category. However, we underperformed the category in wholesome snacks. The cracker business posted a gain in share in Q2 as the big 3 brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House, all saw gains in consumption and growth in share. In combination, these 3 brands posted consumption growth of 7%, driven by core varieties and new products. Cheez-It Grooves, which we launched in the first quarter, continue to do well. And initial results for Town House Pretzel Thins, which were launched at the end of Q2, have been good. In addition, last year's new products, Cheez-it Zings and Town House Pita, both continue to do well in the second year, and we have more big ideas launching later this year. The Keebler cookie brand maintained share in the quarter. The Chips Deluxe line saw good growth as the new cookies co-branded with M&M's continue to do well. However, we posted lower consumption and shipments in our 100-calorie packs, and we actively reduced SKUs in this segment. We have some new products that recently launched, including Keebler S'mores and a new variety of our successful Simply Made cookies, which will have a positive impact on results. However, the effective reductions in the number of SKUs in the tail will continue for the balance of this year and into early next year. In the wholesome snack business, overall sales declined in the second quarter, although we had some success as a result of innovation in Rice Krispies Treats and Kashi, and these new Special K Protein bars gained incremental distribution. However, we saw weakness in the rest of the Special K brand as it faces headwinds from evolving consumer trends in weight management. We are working on new products and have more activity planned for the second half. However, we expect this segment to remain challenging for the balance of the year.","The Pringles business posted both shipment and consumption growth in the quarter, with consumption lapping almost 7% comps in the 13-week period through the end of June. Pringles Tortillas continues to post very strong results, and we have new varieties planned for introduction. And we saw strong support for the brand, including increased display activity in Q2. Pringles is a great brand that has responded well to our initiatives, and we expect continued strong growth in the second half of this year and into the future. Although we gained share in crackers and Pringles, and the Keebler brand held share in cookies in the quarter, we were disappointed with the performance of our snacks business. We are working hard to address the weakness this year, particularly in the Special K brand. And the team is working on plans for longer term, including improved brand building, better innovation and continued good in-store execution.","Now let's look at slide 17 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Internal net sales increased by 1.4% in the quarter. The Foodservice, Convenience and Vending businesses all posted growth. The Foodservice business benefited from increased sales in the school channel, as well as new cracker distribution. The Convenience business posted sales growth greater than overall channel growth due to strength in bars, crackers and Pringles. We ran successful Rice Krispies Treats activity and Pringles Tortillas, and on the go, single-serve Cheez-It also contributed. And in the vending channel, good performance by Rice Krispies Treats and sandwich crackers led to mid-single-digit net sales growth. There was also a decline in sales in the custom segment, where we exited some less profitable businesses. And finally, the broader Pringles business did very well across the segment.","Slide 18 shows the sales performance of the North America Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses. The segment posted an internal sales decline of 4.9% in the quarter. The Frozen Foods business posted a decrease in internal net sales in the quarter, primarily due to difficult comparisons. Last year's high single-digit growth was largely a result of introduction in Special K Flatbread sandwiches, which is one of the most successful launches in recent years in the frozen business. We saw growth in the quarter from new products, such as Eggo Bites, although consumption of the total Eggo brand was below expectations. To address this, we are continuing to focus on some great new products in the second half, coupled with strong marketing programs. Net sales also declined in the Canadian business, although we gained share in the cereal, snack bar and frozen breakfast categories. Pringles also gained share in Canada, driven in part by incremental display activity. In the second half, the Canadian business will benefit from significant new product activity, including the launch of Eggo Thick & Fluffy Waffles, Rice Krispies Shapes cereal and Pringles Tortillas. As we told you earlier, the business has been seeing good early engagement and customer execution on the cereal and milk category-building activity.","Now let's turn to slide 19 in our European business. Internal net sales in the European business increased by 0.7% in the quarter, driven primarily by strong growth from the snack business. We saw good underlying growth in emerging markets in Europe, and the Pringles business posted increased consumption and share across much of the region. In fact, Pringles posted a double-digit increase in net sales, and Pringles net sales have also increased at a double-digit rate in the year-to-date period. You can see on the slide that we had a summer soccer-themed promotional event tied to Pringles, which was very successful across the region. And we started to see some improvement in the cereal category in parts of Europe. In the second quarter, we selectively introduced Muesli on the continent, which is tied to broader brand-building activity. And we launched Special K Granola across the region, also supported by strong programs. Tying all this together is a brand-building campaign we call origins. This campaign helps consumers make the connection between our food and its origins and highlights the food's natural ingredients and simplicity. This is an exciting program that encompasses TV, digital and social media, in-store activity and public relations. And as you can imagine, we have plans for incremental activity and new product introductions across the region over the balance of the year. So the economic environment in Europe is difficult, and the large developed cereal markets are facing similar issues to those seen in the U.S. However, we are growing in parts of the region, and the snack businesses continue to do well. While we expect sales to be down for the full year in Europe, we will continue to execute our plans and remain confident that we are positioning the business for future growth.","Slide 20 shows detail regarding the Latin American business. As you can see, we posted 6.9% net sales growth in the quarter. This was driven by strong price realization, innovation and brand-building activities. Net sales increased in Mexico, Venezuela and Mercosur, with the breakfast category doing well, driven by children's cereals.","The strong innovation I referenced came from Zucaritas Power Balls, Special K Multigrain and Nutri-Grain Fruittella, and we had a very strong soccer theme promotion in Latin America as well that exceeded our expectations. We expect to continued good sales growth in Latin America across the remainder of the year and have lots of activity coming in the second half. In the third quarter, we have new Choco Krispies and All-Bran launching in Mexico and Central America, which will be supported with brand building. We have new packaging launching across a number of brands, and we'll be supporting these introductions as well. And we've got more to come in the fourth quarter. And finally, the region has whole-grain and multi-grain messaging and category-building activity planned for the second half. So hopefully, you can see that we've got a full plan of activity scheduled for the balance of the year in Latin America, which should give us good momentum.","Now let's turn to slide 21 and the Asia Pacific business. Overall, the business posted internal revenue growth of 0.5%. In Asia, we saw mid-single-digit growth, as sales in Japan increased at a double-digit rate, driven by granola. And sales in both South Korea and India increased at a mid-single-digit rate. This was partially offset by the performance in South Africa, which Ron mentioned. Of note is the growth in India, which continue to improve after weakness earlier in the year, resulting from a broader economic slowdown. Pringles continued to perform very well in the region, with double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. We recently launched the brand in India, and we had successful soccer theme promotions that ran in Q2 as well. While the Australian business continued to see declines in the quarter, results were sequentially better. We launched All-Bran Muesli earlier in the year, with good results year-to-date. In addition, the team has good plans for the second half, including investment behind the core cereal brands, new in-store activity and category-building initiatives. And finally, for the Asia Pacific region, while it's not part of the region's reported results, we saw good sales results from the JV we have in China, continuing the performance we saw in the first quarter. In fact, on a pro forma basis, the JV in China would have added approximately 1 point to the region's net sales growth rate. So overall results in Asia were good and performance in Australia improved, and we have more plans in place for the second half of the year. So finally, let's turn to Slide 22 and the summary. We are pleased that the second quarter's earnings per share were in line with expectations. We continue to see weakness in net sales in developed markets, particularly in cereal, but we saw top line growth in each of the international regions. And Pringles performed very well globally.","Project K, our 4-year efficiency and effectiveness program, continues to go well. And we've made great progress so far this year. The GBS initiative is on track, and we have announced further potential rationalization of capacity. And we began to implement incremental programs despite a dry revenue growth around the world. It's very early in what is a 4-year program. And we've got plans with some more exciting new ideas as well, and you'll hear more about these in the months to come. And finally, we are improving the effectiveness of the investment we already make, and this will only increase the opportunities that we believe are available to the company in the years ahead. The transformation that we have begun is a significant one, and it has already involved some difficult decisions. We know it would take time to see improvement, but I'm confident that our Kellogg employees will drive this change. And I'd like to end, as always, by thanking them for all of their hard work. I'd like to turn over now for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Let me just ask a question, if I could, John, about revenue growth. And obviously, you've taken down your expectations for the year, but I just want to get a better sense of how you see that progressing through the remainder of the year? I guess, what I'm getting to is that you have some investments coming up through the savings generated through Project K. I think you're starting to put some money back behind cereal business and other parts of the business. And I'm just curious, should we just expect sequential progress? And then more importantly, in U.S. cereal, can we see sequential progress in that business as well?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, Chris. This is Ron. In terms of our total company revenue expectation for the balance of the year, as we look at the third quarter, revenue is a little bit better, but pretty comparable to the second quarter. We do see an improving trend as we get into the fourth quarter. But as you know, we're down about 2% on a year-to-date basis in terms of our sales performance on an internal basis and our expectation is to be down 1% to 2% for the full year. So we're not banking on significant changes in our revenue position for the balance of the year, but there is slight improvement.","John A. Bryant","Chris, specifically to cereal, we do expect the category to improve slightly as we go through the back part of the year, and our performance to be more in line with the category. Clearly, we've been a bit off that pace in the front half of the year. A few things that we're doing to drive that, I mean, we do have the feet on the street going back into a U.S. cereals organization. Today, we have about 30% of those positions filled. Next month, we should be at about 50%. By October, we should be fully staffed. I think they will help us improve our performance. And we are really focused on improving and driving our cereal business as we go into 2015.","Operator","And our next question is from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, [indiscernible] -- speak maybe to the pipeline right now. It looks like the Q2 numbers were a bit better than Nielsen data would suggest. Are there any areas within cereal or snacks where maybe you can see a trade [indiscernible] to take away trail shipments?","John A. Bryant","As we look at our trade inventories across the business, we think they're in fairly reasonable shape. And remember our cookie, cracker, wholesome snacks business is DSD-delivered. So you don't have a lot of inventory in a DSD system. Our cereal inventories in the U.S. are broadly in line with where they are at this time of year. So we don't see any big inventory overhang at this time","Operator","And the next question is from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I guess, just following up on the cereal question, are there brands where you've decided to maybe channel less resource, manage the cash a bit more and others where you've really thought about channeling incremental investments? And can you give us any examples of that? And then at a broader level, we've seen Campbell Soup making a number of changes to its portfolio over the last few years. You've obviously made the Pringles acquisition, but are you now thinking that more profound changes may be required?","John A. Bryant","Alexia, let me take the cereal question first, and then I'll move to your portfolio question. On cereal, and we've talked about this before, I think there's really 2 issues going on here. One is there's a category relevance issue, and the second is there's some Kellogg-specific issues in some key brands. And if I think about where we are in the category, the category is down about 5%. The good news is the breakfast occasion is growing, but unfortunately, there are more alternative breakfast. And I think we need to change our communication to help people understand how cereal can better meet their needs at breakfast than some of those other alternatives. To do that, we're driving more investment behind things like our cereal and milk program in the U.S. and Canada, the origins program in Europe and a program in Australia we call brains and bones. That is about kid development. So as you look at those programs, we're trying different things around the world. So it's [indiscernible] what resonates best, and we'll quickly share those learnings around the world. So we have focused not just on our brands, but also how we compete more broadly at a macro-category level at the breakfast occasion. As you go within our brands, there are some parts where we are reducing investment, to your question, in particular FiberPlus and Crunchy Nut are brands that, quite frankly, have not worked out for us. And they're about half a share drag on our business in Q2 alone. We are still absolutely committed to investing and improving the performance of other key parts of the business that are not performing the way we'd like, such as Special K and Kashi. On Special K, we think this is a tremendous business with tremendous opportunity, however I think we need to change how we communicate the benefits of Special K as people's expectations of weight management changes around the world. So we're seeing softness, not just in Special K, but diet sodas, reduced calorie, Frozen Foods, et cetera. Weight management programs are also under pressure. So I think consumers are changing their views on weight management from reduced calories to nutritious foods. Now Special K can absolutely meet that criteria, it's a very nutrient-dense food form, but we haven't been communicating it that way. So we are increasing our communication more down that path as opposed to reduce calories. And then, I think, the decision to put Kashi back in La Jolla will enable us to speed up our development process, be much more nimble, agile. And that, I think, will help us drive that business as well. So I think you can see us investing back in key parts of our cereal business. On the portfolio question itself, I think we have made a wonderful acquisition in Pringles, and it has done a couple of things for us. It has more than doubled our international snacks business and tripled the size of the company in certain key emerging markets. And that growth platform, I think, we are only in early days in terms of realizing the potential. And we just have capacity coming on now in Europe and this time next year in Malaysia. So as we think about our business, we have growth strategies in areas of breakfast, which is primarily cereal, snacks, Frozen Foods in emerging markets. And we'll continue to look at M&A opportunities to expand those platforms, particularly, say, international snacks. But I would say that we are very focused on our current portfolio. We think our current portfolio is very strong, and the goal for us is to return the current portfolio to growth as opposed to fundamentally reshape the portfolio.","Operator","And the next question will come from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just had a question about the management changes you've made in U.S. cereal. I understand that Paul Norman is now going to be running it. Was he intimately involved in the strategic decisions you made about how to change the marketing on cereals or is there a risk that you have to start over and rethink some of the decisions now that he's running it? And then secondly, I was looking at our Kantar data. It shows some pretty significant spending declines by Kellogg, Mills and Post. I know Kantar doesn't capture the whole thing, but it just makes it difficult to believe that there really was heavier weight by Kellogg in the cereal media kind of area. And I just wanted to know exactly how much media weight was thrown against cereal on the first half?","John A. Bryant","Let me take the first question on -- so I can't think of a better person than Paul Norman to be running the U.S. cereal business right now. Paul, as you know, stepped into the Chief Growth Officer role for us. Within that, he had the global breakfast team and global snacks team reporting to him, as well as R&D. He's been helping us create the long-term growth strategy for the company. Paul has tremendously deep experience in the cereal business globally and in the U.S. in particular. Paul ran the Morning Foods business for about 5 or so years back in the 2000s, quite frankly, over the period of greater success for the Kellogg Company in the U.S. Paul was running that business. He knows absolutely what is required to get the business back on track, and he's helping us work on an exciting restage of the cereal business in 2015. So as you think about this cereal business, we need to have all guns loaded going to 2015. We need category-building activity, brand-specific activity, large tent-pole events in-store, which enable us to execute in-store with excellence. Innovation or renovation is on trend for where consumers are heading, and put the feet back on the street in terms of improve the merchandising support behind the business. So I'm excited to have Paul have responsibility for that business. I think he will absolutely help us get this business back on track where we need it to be. On the question on Kantar cereal advertising, we have increased our advertising in cereal, particularly here in Q2. What I will highlight is, sometimes, it's hard to track where that advertising is going because of increasing spend in areas like digital and so on. I'm not sure how Kantar would even be able to track some of that spend. So I'm not sure of the methodology that Kantar is using, but I can assure you from a Kellogg perspective, we are absolutely spending more behind advertising in cereal in the U.S.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Paul's ascension to the role, do you have to -- is he going to rethink any of the decisions that were made already or not?","John A. Bryant","I think Paul is improving the plans as we go through the back half of '14 and into '15.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just hoping to get your thoughts, John, on the promotional environment in food today. Walmart, talking a bit about backing off the sort of all promo, all-the-time philosophy in food, that hasn't really driven tonnage to the extent the company wanted. So I'm hoping eventually, right, vendors to Walmart like you will be able to ease off the deal pedal a bit. Is this a view you share? Or is it, given the environment, just a bit too early to get optimistic about what could be a more rational pricing environment later this year?","John A. Bryant","Okay. I can't talk about what the pricing environment might be later this year, but the way we think about the categories we operate in, they're all intensely-competitive categories. I'd say that they're all relatively rational. We are seeing some reduced promotion effectiveness for a couple of reasons. Some retailers are putting multiple manufacturers on the one display, which reduces the effectiveness of that display, quite frankly, not just for us, but for the retailer as well. We have to look at the quality of quality merchandising in some of our businesses we've seen, less front-of-store displays or back-of-store displays. So as we look at the business, we think we have an opportunity to improve our merchandising performance, and we're doing that by adding Kellogg sales reps back into the cereal business and investing back in our DSD business in snacks. Having said that, the primary way to drive this business is through brand building, innovation, renovation. And that's where we see the long-term growth opportunity, which is why when we talk about investing back in our business, investing back to improve the quality of our current merchandising programs and to improve the quality and amount of our brand-building investment to engage consumers more effectively.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, I'll focus a little bit on your input cost and inflation. I think a lot of people are staring at the grain price charts looking at corn falling below $4, and probably scratching their head as to why you're going to be facing 3%, 3.5%-type inflation. So can you talk a little bit about some of the components of what's driving inflation? And the next question that I'm sure people ask in looking at the chart is whether or not you were just hedged, and therefore, deferring the benefit into next year. Is that indeed the case?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Well, as I mentioned on the call earlier, Jason, we are covered at approximately 90% at this point in time. I think the thing you have to remember also is you're looking at the exchange-traded commodities, which are a small percentage of the total market basket of inputs that we buy, that go into our food by a number of things across commodities, packaging and energy as well. And we've said before, we've seen increases or inflation across packaging. We've seen increases in fruits and nuts, a number of things, energy as well. Now I did say that our inflation was much more front-end weighted. And as a result, we will see improvement in terms of our net inflation position or net deflation position as we move into the back end of the year. Our inflation will come down to much lower levels, and our savings will ramp up as we go through the balance of the year. And that's helping us from a profitability standpoint, particularly as we get into the fourth quarter. So some of what you are seeing within our performance also could be attributable to the positions that we took as we came into the year, and the fact that we are now 90% covered on our commodities.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And turning real quick to the expense side, can you quantify what brand building, just on the consumer side? Considering marketing and advertising was up in the quarter. And your comments on sort of in-line maybe a little bit better than the sales growth for the year. You're guiding to sales down. So does this imply that brand building may not actually grow this year?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, so in terms of our brand building, what I had said in the prepared remarks was that we were up at a mid-single-digit rate within the second quarter performance. On our brand building, as we said, we expect to invest at a rate that's equal to or greater than our sales performance. Now our sales have come down, so our brand building has come down a little bit. We've pulled some brand building out, where we weren't seeing the effectiveness of that investment impacting our business. Now what I would say, though, is we are still reinvesting the savings that we committed associated with Project K behind the cereal category relevance messaging, and also behind sales resources across our U.S. cereal and our U.S. Snacks business.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First, just a follow-up on your previous comments on Special K, that weight management brand much like Yoplait or a Diet Coke or the trade-up foods of yesteryear, but all having a pretty hard time recently, as you said. Do you think that the nutrient-rich advertising angle you mentioned before will be enough to turn that brand and get it back to the -- on board with its core consumer, which I guess is high-income female? Or are you thinking perhaps other renovations in the brand and the ingredients are needed? And I have a second follow-up.","John A. Bryant","So David, I think the answer is both on Special K. So if you look at what's happening on weight management brands, to your point, whether it be diet soda, weight loss programs, various [indiscernible] primarily on being reduced calorie. That's really not sufficient anymore to engage with the weight management consumer. That consumer is now looking not just for lower calories, but for benefits of food. In some respects, to move from calorie deprivation to I want to eat great healthy food. And we do believe we have an opportunity to change our communications, that our current food actually does meet that need of the consumer. And we have the ability to innovate with new product launches that are even more on trend, and to renovate some of the food in some of the markets in which we operate in. So for example, our Special K business in wholesome snacks in the U.S., I think we have an opportunity to renovate that food and make it even more on trend from a weight management perspective.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And with regard to your investments in the feet on the street, and I guess, you're shifting at brand-building spending, is there any small signs that those -- that spending is working that you can see in what is an otherwise tough environment? And then how -- what is your timetable that you will be looking at where you say these investments are working or not working. Where you think about making changes?","John A. Bryant","We're watching these investments very closely to understand and track their impact and then learn and reapply rapidly. As I've said, we're doing different programs around the world. Here in North America, it was more cereal and milk-related from a category-building perspective. In Europe, it's origins. In Australia, it's brains and bones. And we will rapidly reapply based on what we see gets the biggest impact. Quite frankly, how well we execute these programs also is a key driver. So for example, in Canada in Q2, we had the cereal and milk program. It was actually very successful the retailers really got behind it, merchandised milk with cereal. And we actually stabilized our cereal business in Canada in Q2 and cereal sales were relatively flat. We gained almost a share point in the quarter. So we saw good outcome there. We had pockets of excellence in the execution in the U.S., but we were a little bit more patchy in it. Quite frankly, I think we have an opportunity to continue to drive that execution. And that's part of the reason why we're putting some of the reps back into the U.S. sales organization to help us with the in-store merchandising and help us with the execution of these programs. So if you think about how we track the performance of these programs, they're not programs that are necessarily designed to immediately turn the business. These are longer-term consumer brand building-type programs. They take time to measure and track. But clearly, we would have hoped to have seen a better response in cereal in Q2 than what we received. We did see a better response, in fact, in Canada. The back part of this year we'll have a better sense of how well these programs are working, and then we'll alter and reapply as we go into 2015.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick things. One, I can't remember, John, was the original overall category building work in cereal, did it always include sort of individual brand messages as part of the category message or is that a change?","John A. Bryant","It is a bit more of a change, Andrew. We are increasing the focus on individual brands. There was some individual brand orientation in the original work, but I think we're seeing the ability to bring it to life in-store and through the whole 360 degrees is benefited by actually bringing specific brands into the programs themselves.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then second, you mentioned that even after some of the capacity actions that you've taken, that Kellogg may still have still some excess capacity in cereal. And I guess, I'm wondering from maybe some of your benchmarking work, if you think the industry sort of faces this, too, even though it seems like all the other big cereal players have taken some capacity reductions already as well?","John A. Bryant","Well certainly looking at our network, as I've said in the prepared remarks. We do believe we may have some excess cereal capacity. I think if you look at the performance of some of the other cereal manufacturers, I don't think we'll be surprised if they have some excess capacity as well. I think, though, they're in a better position to talk to their capacity position than I am.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So all these things, if there are other actions needed, I assume would all be part of kind of the current Project K that you've got underway? Is that fair?","John A. Bryant","We'll be looking at it in the context of Project K, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ron, I just wanted to get a clarification on a comment you made. So in response to Jason, I think that you said that the first half inflation was positive and related to specific hedge positions, the company took, but that in the second half, this gets significantly better. First, do I understand you correctly? And then I've got a question for John.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes, you do understand that correctly. So our inflation comes down significantly in the back half of the year, and our productivity ramps up as well. So we experience net deflation and more so in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And John, so just kind of going back to cereal, but I want to be specific. So you had such tremendous optimism on the last call about the very specific programs on Special K, Mini-Wheats and Kashi. Just given the fact that it just doesn't look like it took much hold here in the quarter, would you agree that there are fundamental macro headwinds with the consumer that are impacting this category? And until we see that low-end consumer get better, that this category is fundamentally challenged. And that even when you put in good programs, it's just hard to get people to buy it when they don't have the money. What's not correct about that statement?","John A. Bryant","I think if we go back to the last quarterly conference call, the guidance I gave on cereal is that we expected the category to be down for the year and for our performance to improve through the year to be more in line with the category. It's fair to say we're a little bit disappointed with our performance in cereal in Q2, but we still have confidence that we will improve the performance as we go through the year. I believe cereal is a long-term growth potential category. Now in a market like the U.S., it's probably low-single digits, but the company did grow cereal in the U.S, 3% to 4% on a dollar-sales perspective across most of the 2000s. And when we did that, we had tremendous brand-building programs. We had great innovation. We had excellent in-store execution. So I believe we have the ability to do that. I do believe the category is under some pressure right now from some of these breakfast alternatives. I believe we'll resolve that by both having outstanding brand-specific activity, but also by coming back and reminding consumers of how the benefits of this category is better than -- is stronger than a lot of the other alternatives at the breakfast occasion. So I do believe that ultimately, this is up to the manufacturers to improve our performance. I believe we have an opportunity as a company to definitely bring better, stronger programs to market. As we think about restaging our cereal business going to 2015, that's what we're working to do. So I'm not trying to suggest it's an immediate bounce back, David. I think this category will be under some pressure for some time, but I do believe it can return to growth.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But it's just not, in your opinion, it's just not more of a macro issue with the consumer, it's a specific issue of Kellogg's ability to get the category moving and as well as the other manufacturers. Is that what you're saying?","John A. Bryant","I absolutely believe that we can and we'll return this category to growth, and the manufacturers are focused on doing that. And we are definitely focused on doing that.","Simon Burton","Laura, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, that last question will come from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ron, please give a bit about Venezuela? I guess, you're sticking at the 6 rate. Companies like Meade are at 11. I think there's some consumer packaged goods companies that have already gone to like north of 50. So what, I guess, triggers a change in that accounting treatment?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Well, first of all, I guess, let me talk about why we are valued, where we are valued at this point in time. And let me remind you, Venezuela's a relatively small part of the business in comparison to the total company. It's around 1% to 2% of our sales, and it's around 2% of our operating profit. We do manufacture the majority of our product within the country. Now we do pull some raw materials and packaging materials from outside of the country into the country to be able to do that manufacturing. But Eric, we've been able to get access to funds at the official rate when we have done that, we are also deemed a priority industry by the government. The valuation of the business is really based on facts and circumstances. And based on these facts and circumstances, we were able to value the business at the 6.3, the official rate. Now we're making sure that investors and analysts are clear within our disclosures, we're giving you the information on our net asset position, and then as well the earnings per share impact, and I communicated that earlier on the call. If we were to devalue the business today to that SICAD 1 rate, it would impact us by about $0.07 to $0.09 on an earnings per share basis. If we were to move to the SICAD 2 rate, it would be about double that, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, the key is that you continue to take the dollars out, and that's what, at least at this point, is probably a major factor in keeping the rate where you are?","Ronald L. Dissinger","Priority industry and able to get the dollars out, that is correct -- or dollars in, I should say, at the official rate.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, John, just last question, I guess, on Kashi. I think that the company had said previously that the sales for Kashi had peaked at about $0.5 billion? But it's been a number of quarters, if not years now, where it's been declining. Where -- what is the revenue now? And I guess, when do you think the switch to La Jolla into new -- or the return of the previous management to running that business, when do we think that, that can start to show results?","John A. Bryant","Eric, the business now is in the sort of low 400s in terms of size, and we believe it has tremendous growth potential from there. The -- David Denholm will be with the company here in the back half of the year, and we expect to have that team up and operating at the end of the year. So we're going to go through a process of moving the business back to La Jolla. The whole purpose of moving the business back to La Jolla is to increase the rate of speed, the agility, to be able to get on trends much faster and be more aligned with that community. So I expect it to have a faster impact than, say, turning around more of a mainstream business. However, it will take some time because it is still one of the largest natural foods businesses in the United States, in fact, in the world. So we'll need to innovate, renovate and get back on our front foot in that business. So I think we'll be doing that through '15 and '16. I'm not going to give a sales forecast for what I think's going to happen to one business, though, as we look out over the next -- over '15 or '16.","Simon Burton","Okay. Thanks, Laura. I think we're finished. If anybody has any more follow-up questions, please get a hold of us. We'll be around for the next couple of days.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.","As a reminder, when describing our results and outlook during today's prepared remarks, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis, unless otherwise noted. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the details on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.","Finally, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, November 7. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","And now, I'll turn it over to John and slide number 3.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As announced last month, I am retiring, after seven years as Kellogg's CEO and 20 years with the company, in order to spend more time with my family. There's never a perfect time to make a move like this, but the Q3 results and outlook and where we are on key initiatives make this an appropriate time to make this transition.","I also strongly believe that Steve Cahillane is the right person for the role. He has significant leadership experience, including as a CEO. His extensive background in CPG companies means he knows how to grow big brands. His experience in international markets means he knows how to expand abroad. And his latest stint at Nature's Bounty gives him keen insights on today's health and wellness definition. He brings fresh perspectives from the outside that can help drive new ideas.","Steve's spent the past month reviewing the plans of each of our regions. He takes the reins at a time when the company is undergoing an enormous transformation, amidst an industry that is undergoing significant change. And I'm even more convinced today that he's the right person for the job.","Steve, welcome aboard.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to be here. Let me first thank John for his service and a very effective transition. I'm glad to have him staying on as Chairman into March of next year.","I'm only four weeks into the job, but I've had the opportunity to review the commercial and supply chain plans of most of our businesses. And what I've learned has only confirmed that I made the right decision to come to Kellogg. First, we've got incredible brands, outstanding food and a strong culture. These factors have made Kellogg special for over a century.","Second, the company's on sound financial footing. Project K included some very aggressive actions, and Zero-Based Budgeting required the entire organization to change the way it works. The cost structure has been reduced, underlying profitability has been improved and returns on investment are improving.","And third, based on what I've seen over the past few weeks, the company can and will return to top-line growth. Key elements are already in growth, from Pringles to our Frozen Foods brands, to our Specialty Channels businesses, to our expanding emerging market presence.","The entire organization is hungry to get back to growth, and it's open to new ideas. For instance, our 1894 venture capital fund invests in early stage technology and food businesses. We've been experimenting with direct-to-consumer for our Bear Naked brand, and we're learning from the pop-up cafes we've opened up around the world. And as evidenced by the acquisition of RXBAR, we're even willing to acquire growth. This is not a company that's sitting on its hands.","So Kellogg is already doing many of the right things to get back on track amidst a very challenging industry environment, particularly around cost structure and emerging market scale. Businesses are starting to turn, and there's more we can do, so I'm very excited.","I'll have more thoughts to share after my first 100 days or roughly the time of CAGNY. I look forward to working with all of you in the investor community.","So for now, I'll turn it back to John and the rest of the business update.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Steve. Let's turn to the quarter and slide 5. We generated strong double-digit growth in operating profit, and we generated sequential improvement in our top line. These results keep us on track to achieve our guidance for the year. A few highlights: Project K and ZBB have reduced our cost structure, enabling us to continue to improve margins significantly and keeping us on pace toward our margin expansion goals. DSD transition continued to go as planned. We're now out of DSD completely, a tremendous joint execution by our team and our customers. Paul will talk more about this in a moment.","As expected, we posted sequential improvement in net sales during Q3, driven by what we said would drive it. Special K's declines moderated across categories and countries. Pringles regained its promotional footing in Europe, returning to growth there and globally. And North America Other returned to growth as Frozen gained momentum and Canada and Kashi continued to improve.","We also progressed on other growth avenues. eCommerce growth continued, reflecting a broad push to win wherever the shopper shops. Emerging markets expansion continued, especially when you consider our unconsolidated and rapidly-growing joint ventures as well as the integration and growth of Parati, the business we acquired in Brazil last December. And we acquired a new growth platform in RXBAR.","Let's take a closer look at some of these areas of progress. We'll start with slide 6 and how we're doing on stabilizing the health and wellness elements of our portfolio. We've mentioned previously that one brand, Special K, accounted for all of our net sales decline, and then some, through the past couple of years. Stabilizing this brand is an obvious priority. Through renovation and innovation of our food and packaging, strengthening our food credentials and through a new inner strength positioning, which media only just went on air at the beginning of Q3, we are seeing signs of progress.","Specifically, we've seen a clear moderation in its net sales decline in cereal globally. And we have cut its consumption and share declines in half in cereal markets ranging from the U.S., to Canada to Spain and even more dramatically in markets like the UK and Mexico. This is encouraging progress for a very big brand whose declines had a significant impact on our total company net sales.","Next, you can see on slide 7 that our Pringles sales returned to growth in Q3, as we had indicated. As you know, this is our biggest brand globally, with excellent prospects to sustain growth. And it had been growing consistently in the mid-single digits ever since we acquired it in late 2012. Unfortunately, you'll recall that we ran into a temporary setback earlier this year, when prolonged customer negotiations kept us out of normal promotion activities in Europe during Q1 and Q2.","The good news is that over the course of Q3, we did return to promotional activity, and this turned our European Pringles sales from sharp decline into resumed growth. Just as important, Pringles recorded net sales growth in Q3 across all of our regions globally.","Slide 8 offers another encouraging sign. We've returned to share gains in our three core developed cereal markets outside the U.S. They are Australia, Canada and the UK. You'll recall that stabilizing these markets was a major priority for us this year. And we're executing well on the three things that we know drives cereal consumption: food use, in the form of renovation and innovation that emphasized nutrition credentials or enhanced taste; great commercial ideas that engage consumers; and winning in-store during key promotional events. As a result, we're winning in these markets across a number of brands.","The U.S. is a different story this year, and this is disappointing. After having stabilized that business in 2015 and 2016, we haven't brought enough excitement to the category this year, but as Paul will address in a moment, we're implementing a much stronger 2018 plan. The point is we are proving that we can stabilize these big developed cereal markets and we can return them to growth in the future.","Finally, I'd like to say a few words about RXBAR, the acquisition we announced a few weeks ago and closed just a few days ago. This is on slide 9. This is a high quality premium brand in a unique position, at the intersection of simple natural ingredients and high protein. It's growing rapidly. Its sales will nearly quadruple in 2017. And somewhat rare in this space, it is already very profitable.","RXBAR will operate independently, preserving what makes it special, including its talented people and entrepreneurial culture. Kellogg is here to help RXBAR in its next leg of growth via our substantial R&D resources and through our ability to expand its distribution. This will serve as a new additional platform for growth for us. This is a special opportunity, and we're excited about its growth prospects.","So overall, we feel good about the direction we're heading. Let me now turn it over to Fareed to talk you through your financials.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John. Slide 10 shows a summary of our financial results in Q3 and year-to-date. Our third quarter results came in largely as expected. Net sales declined in the quarter on a currency-neutral comparable basis, but again showed sequential improvement, even despite the negative impact of the DSD transitions planned price adjustments and disruptions as we moved our U.S. Snacks business to a warehouse model.","Operating profit continued to increase in the quarter, with growth accelerating, largely because our DSD overhead savings began to be realized. Earnings per share grew, despite comparing against an unusually low tax rate a year ago, keeping us solidly on track for our full year guidance. There's a little bit of timing favorability, which I'll discuss in a moment, but, overall, a good quarter.","So let's get into a little bit more detail. Slide 11 breaks our currency-neutral comparable net sales performance into its key components. As you can see from the slide, our volume declines moderated again, as we saw marked improvement in the trends for specific brands and businesses that we had called out previously. For example, Pringles returned to growth in Europe after an unusual decline in the first half. We saw a moderation of declines in Special K and Kashi, as renovated product lines took hold on shelf and new media campaigns went on air. And our U.S. Frozen brands, Eggo and Morningstar Farms, picked up momentum that started in Q2.","And, as planned, the DSD transition had a bigger negative impact on sales in Q3 than it did in the first half. This impact is comprised of two factors: first, the volume impacts of pulling back on merchandising early in the quarter to facilitate the transition, as well as the impact of SKU rationalization; and second, the list price adjustment we gave our customers because we no longer provide the services of ordering, warehousing, delivery and stocking. So, roughly speaking, we estimate these DSD transition-related items collectively to have impacted net sales by less than minus 2% in the quarter.","It's important to realize that our price\/mix was again positive, and that's in spite of the realized price adjustments in our DSD exited categories. So overall, we think net sales in Q3 did pick up about a percentage point of growth from trade inventory build ahead of hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S., and we believe this trade inventory will come out in Q4. Once again, while we are not content with our net sales declines, by any means, Q3 did reflect continued improvement, even excluding unusual factors like the DSD transition and hurricane-related shipments.","Turning to slide 12, you'll see that our profit margin initiatives remain on track. From Project K, to ZBB, to the various capabilities that we've developed to improve ROI, we continue to progress towards our margin expansion goals. The bulk of the investments and actions at Project K are now largely behind us, with incremental savings running through 2019. The same goes for ZBB, which is now incorporated into our daily operations.","Our ROI efforts are ongoing, and we have much of the infrastructure and processes in place. This includes deeper analytics that help us prioritize investments and more real-time measurement that allows us to course-correct. The impact of these initiatives is why we say we have such good visibility into our cost structure going into the next couple of years.","The impact of these margin expansion efforts can be seen in our Q3 and year-to-date profit margins shown on slide 13. Gross profit margin was flat in the quarter, but, remember, this includes the reset of our U.S. Snacks gross margin as it shifts out of DSD and into warehouse. Specifically, the DSD transition involves the adjustment of our list prices and it also involves increased resources in warehouse logistics, which are now is COGS. Excluding this DSD-related reset in U.S. Snacks, our gross margin continued to increase during Q3, as savings from Project K supply chain restructuring and from Zero-Based Budgeting, continue to more than offset the cost of investing in food and packaging and the operating leverage impact of lower volume.","On our operating profit margin, we saw an acceleration of our already strong expansion, led by efficiencies and savings in SG&A. The SG&A improvement has been evident all year, aided by ZBB and Project K, but accelerated sharply in Q3 when we started to see the DSD overhead savings.","There is a portion of our operating profit that was timing-related. Specifically, we did delay some brand-building investment out of Q3. For instance, in U.S. Snacks, we increased our investment a little less than originally planned because we wanted to get further through the transition. This brand-building will be invested in Q4.","Nevertheless, we're obviously pleased with our operating profit growth in Q3, and our margin expansion remains very much on track. Also on track is cash flow, as shown on slide 14. Year-to-date, our cash flow is tracking ahead of last year. Our net income is higher and our core working capital improved as a percentage of sales year-over-year, driven by payables. So through the first nine months, we still feel good about hitting our full year cash flow target.","With that, let's turn to slide 15. Our Q3 results kept us well on pace towards our full-year guidance, so we are reaffirming our guidance for currency-neutral comparable net sales, operating profit and EPS, as well as cash flow.","Now, we recognize that our Q3 results may have been ahead of your expectations, so let me explain a few timing-related elements that you should take into account when considering our unchanged full-year guidance. First, on net sales, we had a couple of timing-related shipment benefits in Q3, as I mentioned earlier. Hurricane-related shipments are likely to come out of Q4. And we also benefited from some DSD-related pipeline fill shipments that we'd expected to come back in Q2, and that is now behind us as we progress to Q4.","Additionally, U.S. Snacks in Q4 will also have a full quarter of the list price adjustment. These factors mean our net sales will decline a bit more than they did in Q3. However, it's important to note that if you exclude these hurricane and DSD-related impacts, we expect to see continued sequential improvement in our underlying net sales.","On operating profit, here are some things to note. We did delay some brand-building into Q4, as I already mentioned. And on top of that, we are investing some of Q3's upside into incremental brand-building to help us improve our top-line performance going into next year. This should result in a double-digit increase on year-over-year brand-building.","So put this on top of an already difficult comparison and you can see why our Q4 operating profit growth will likely be smaller than our large Q3 gain. But again, smoothing out for timing, the underlying business delivery continues to improve, especially given the full quarter of DSD overhead savings.","So that's how we see phases and we have good confidence in our ability to deliver our full-year guidance. In fact, the only changes we are making today are to items outside our currency-neutral comparable performance, specifically: our upfront costs, which came down mainly because of curtailment gains related to pension-plan amendments; and currency translations, which have been trending more favorably. These two items are detailed in our press release.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Paul to give you an update on our North American business segments.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Fareed. We'll start with our transformation of U.S. Snacks and an update on our DSD transition on slide number 16. I'm very pleased with the execution of this extremely complex undertaking. Customer feedback has been very good, and our operational metrics are all on track. By the end of July, we were shipping completely via warehouse distribution to all customers and exiting our DCs, trucks and equipment and reducing the workforce. We are working diligently with our customer to ensure all details and issues are taken care of. And I'm extremely proud of how our organization has risen to this challenge.","From the standpoint of in-market performance, you saw the impact of the transition in our scanner data and we expected this. We pulled right back on promotional activity in order to facilitate the production and shipping of initial inventories to the warehouses of our customers. This resulted in sharp declines in incremental sales, promotional volume and number of displays. Our average number of items are down, too, reflecting our SKU rationalization.","Now, as we look forward, we will see momentum build behind a more focused assortment on-shelf and fewer, but bigger, displays with an emphasis on quality positions. All of this will be supported by significant increases in brand-building against our largest brands, as we move from push to pull. The net results of all of this will be an improvement in our in-market performance over the coming weeks and months.","From a financial perspective, the transformation of Snacks remains on track. We have already begun to boost our brand-building investment. And, as you can see in our Q3 P&L, the expected overhead reductions are coming through to the bottom line.","An undertaking of this magnitude isn't easy. We've come a long way and we still have work to do. But you're starting to see U.S. Snack's future taking shape. There is no question that this will become a stronger, more profitable business.","Snack's Q3 results, summarized on slide number 17, came in as expected. Net sales were impacted by the factors we've already discussed: the list price adjustment; the pullback in merchandising; and the rationalization of SKUs. Nevertheless, we also saw a strong increase in operating profit and operating margin. We did boost our brand-building investment in Q3, which bodes well for future performance. And this was more than offset by a ramp-up of overhead savings during the quarter, as we reduced our workforce and exited distribution centers, trucks and equipment.","In the fourth quarter, we're working to build momentum. We're increasing brand-building significantly, including in-market promotional support. And we expect to see an improvement in consumption. Meanwhile, we'll be close to a full overhead savings rate, boosting profit. We'll give back some benefits from Q3, including hurricane-related shipments and some brand-building timing, but profit growth will still be very strong.","Now, let's turn to slide number 18 and U.S. Morning Foods, where our top-line and in-market performance have been below our expectations. There are some things that have continued to work well. We've continued to gain share in kid-oriented brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops, which have brought to market innovation and brand-building that have excited consumers. And we've continued to improve our profit margins through effective productivity initiatives.","Where we've fallen short is on bringing enough excitement to our adult-oriented health and wellness brands. This is the segment that is most holding down the entire cereal category's sales and especially ours. What we have to do is get back to running the playbook that worked well for us before this year and that is working well for our kid-oriented brands to-date.","So here's what we're planning for 2018. Firstly, we do have stronger commercial ideas. We have new media that will emphasize the health and wellness credentials of Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran, two brands that simply didn't have strong enough brand-building this year. We also launched the next phase of the Special K Own It campaign, emphasizing the brand's inner strength credentials and positioning. And we've got great ideas for our kid-oriented brands, emphasizing out of breakfast snacking, for example.","Secondly, you will see a step change in innovation next year. We'll renovate and innovate against our core, with news on Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops as well as more fruit-filled Raisin Bran and Special K that moves into probiotics. This is bigger innovation activity than this year.","We'll also try some new things that are new to the category. These will lean into health and wellness and into convenience. And you will hear more about them in the months to come. Third, we'll drive bigger in-store excitement, with stronger properties and events and programs that leverage a total Kellogg go-to-market model now that U.S. Snacks is no longer in DSD. Imagine, for example, promotions and displays featuring Rice Krispies and Rice Krispies Treats together. We can now do that seamlessly for the first time.","We'll do these three things for Pop-Tarts as well. This brand will come to market with strong food news in January. And we'll follow that up with differentiated innovation around mid-year.","We know what needs to be done because we've done it before. Remember, we stabilized U.S. cereal in 2015 and 2016, and we've done it this year in our other three core cereal markets, all following the same playbook. For the rest of 2017, I don't see a change in trend for Morning Foods. But I am encouraged by the strength of our plans and expect much improved performance in 2018.","Now, let's talk about Specialty Channels shown on slide number 19. This business posted its ninth straight quarter of sales and profit growth in Q3, a reflection of continued good execution by our team. Sales growth in the quarter was led by both convenience and foodservice channels, Specialty segments like K through 12 schools and cafeterias, with an added pickup from hurricane-related orders.","The hybrid direct and broker approach we implemented early this year is giving us greater focus on key accounts and channels, while more economically expanding our reach to new customers. And it gives us confidence in the future growth potential for this business.","Margin expansion continued on the strength of ZBB and RGM efforts. These are important and growing channels for us. And our sustained momentum reflects our continued commitment and focus to winning wherever the shopper shops.","Turning to slide number 20 and our North American Other segment. We had signaled an improved second half. And this segment certainly delivered, with a return to top line growth in Q3.","U.S. Frozen Foods sustained the momentum it started the previous quarter. Eggo accelerated its consumption growth and share gains on the strength of its removal of artificial colors and flavors and the success of Disney-shaped waffles. It also benefited from the exit of a competitor. This was skewed mostly to the east coast, and the brand grew even excluding this.","Our Morningstar Farms line has returned to consumption and share growth, too, reflecting focused marketing and in-store support on our core burger offerings during the summer grilling season.","Kashi Company continued its sequential improvement in the quarter, as anticipated. Whilst we haven't completely lapped some of the distribution declines on the Kashi brand, we are seeing strong momentum in cereal share led by Bare Naked, which is now the number one granola brand in the U.S. Meanwhile, our renovated snacks offerings are stabilizing share, as we had anticipated, with share getting back up to flat in the quarter.","In Canada, we generated continued improvement in consumption, with broad-based share gains in both cereal and snacks. This business has now lapped the elasticity impact of price increases executed last year and is showing consistent improvement as we invest behind strong commercial programming and innovation.","So to wrap up North America, I'm encouraged by the way we're executing post-DSD in Snacks. I'm delighted to see our North American Other businesses turning around. And we're sustaining good momentum in Specialty Channels.","Cereal is a tough category right now, but we have a stronger commercial plan in place, particularly as we get to 2018. And, of course, I like what we've done to our cost structure, which has driven continued margin expansion.","I'll now hand you back to John for a review of international business.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Paul. Let's now discuss Europe, shown on slide 21. We had a much improved top-line performance in Europe in Q3. And as we had anticipated, it was driven by two key factors. The first was Pringles. You'll recall that our European Pringles business, which had been growing reliably at a mid to high single-digit rate in recent years, suddenly declined at a sharp rate in the first half. This negative swing reflected prolonged negotiations with customers regarding our price increase on reformulated product. While these negotiations were largely behind us by early Q2, our share of merchandising events was reduced significantly through the entire first half. As anticipated, we resumed promotional activity during Q3 and returned the brand to year-on-year sales growth.","The second major factor was UK cereal. This is a key business that has been declining for us in recent years, and that stabilization is something we called out as a major priority for us this year. And we're doing just that.","In Q3, our consumption and share sustained the year-on-year growth trend from earlier in the year. This is an impressive turnaround. It's being driven by several of our brands, achieved by executing the three things we know works in cereal: better commercial ideas; food news through renovation and innovation; and better in-store promotional events.","Corn Flakes is a great example. Through a great commercial idea asking consumers, what's your perfect bowl? It reminded them of this brand's tremendous versatility, and it gained share as a result.","As we go into the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued Pringles growth and UK cereal improvement, leading to sequential improvement as we head into 2018.","Let's talk about Latin America, which is shown on slide 22. It's been a disappointing year for us in Latin America, but really because of one single sub-region, Caribbean\/Central America.","Recall that late 2016 distributor transitions built up trade inventories that created a significant overhang when consumption trends slowed sharply in the first half amidst macroeconomic pressures. This inventory overhang and consumption softness persisted in Q3, exacerbated by the damage wrought by Hurricanes Maria and Irma, with our big Puerto Rico business being most disrupted.","The good news is that we generated growth outside of Caribbean\/Central America. This includes growth in our largest market, Mexico. It also includes good performance in (31:32), where we posted particularly strong growth in Pringles despite a challenging economic climate.","We also continue to make good progress on integrating Parati, the acquisition we made in Brazil late last December, and that business continues to perform well. This acquisition will anniversary in December, so our comparable basis results will start reflecting it then.","Unfortunately, because of the issues we faced in Caribbean\/Central America, 2017 is turning out to be a soft year for Latin America, but the fundamentals are in place for sequentially improving results as we head into 2018.","We'll finish up with Asia Pacific on slide 23. Asia Pacific had another strong quarter, with solid top-line growth and a substantial increase in operating profit. Pringles sustained its growth in the quarter, with continued share gains for the region. In cereal, we've spoken previously about the stabilization of our Australian business, and it continued to grow share during the third quarter.","We continue to grow cereal sales in Asia, with growth in most key markets led by Granola and eCommerce and an encouraging reacceleration of sales growth in India, which had been held back in recent quarters, first by demonetization and then by the rollout of the country's Goods and Services Tax.","Not included in our consolidated results are our joint ventures in West Africa and China. Once again, these operations posted strong double-digit net sales growth year-on-year, continue to build scale for us in these emerging markets. Our West Africa venture is growing on the strength of noodles, while our China venture is benefiting from Granola Cereal and rapid expansion in eCommerce. These joint ventures are a key element of our emerging market strategy, and their growth has been outstanding.","So Asia Pacific is carrying good momentum into the fourth quarter. And thanks to the benefits of Zero-Based Budgeting and Revenue Growth Management, Asia Pacific is also posting strong margin expansion, even in spite of a mix shift toward emerging markets.","Allow me to summarize with slide 24. First, we remain solidly on track to deliver our financial guidance for the year. Q3 features sequential improvement in sales, continued margin expansion, strong profit and earnings growth and higher cash flow.","Second, our single biggest transformational initiative this year, our transition out of DSD, remains on track. This was a large, complex and risky endeavor and has been executed extremely well. It's also essential to accelerating growth and margin expansion for our big U.S. Snacks business.","Third, our productivity initiatives are progressing well and giving us good visibility into cost savings for the next couple of years. And finally, we know we have to grow our top line and we are committed to doing so. We continue to progress on our building blocks for improving our top-line performance. We're stabilizing our core international developed cereal markets. Special K and Kashi continue to show signs of improvement. Pringles is growing globally. We returned our Frozen Foods brands to growth. We sustained growth in Specialty Channels. We continue to build scale in emerging markets. And our acquisition of RXBAR gives us a new on-trend platform for growth.","As usual, I'd like to extend my gratitude to our employees for their hard work and dedication. Let me turn it over to Steve for any final comments he might have.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John. I would just reiterate that I feel extremely confident about the potential of this company. Results are coming in as expected and there is a lot of energy around getting back to sustainable profitable growth.","I'm not in a position right now to give any guidance on 2018, as we are still evaluating our business units' plans. But I can tell you that there is a high degree of confidence in our expected cost savings and I'm very encouraged by the commitment of the organization to getting back to top-line growth. We are stabilizing soft elements of the business. We are gaining traction in growing elements of our business. And we have a lot of great ideas that can take us further.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mr. Moskow, your line is open on our end.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Yes. This is Neil Kugurney (36:29) in for Robert Moskow. Just one question from me, I know you're not giving formal guidance for 2018, but could you comment at all on the gross margin targets with the new management at around 18%? Is there a chance of that remaining as is or any changes? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, Neil, (36:47) I'll take that question. This is Steve. We are not giving any formal guidance for 2018. What I would tell you, however, the time that I spent reviewing the businesses, there is tremendous visibility into our cost programs. There's a lot of momentum that's been happening around the transformation of this business. And even if you look at Q3 at 17.6% operating profit margin, we're well on track.","And so we'll be spending the next 90 days or so, Fareed and I, along with John, traveling around the businesses really understanding exactly where the opportunities are, so that we can strike the right balance between top-line growth and continued margin expansion.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thanks very much, Steve.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. I'm going to follow-up on that by asking about 2018 as well. The company already has given operating margin guidance for 2018. Two summers ago, Kellogg said the operating margin will be up about 350 basis points from 2015. Is this guidance still on the table? I realize there's some headwinds in terms of sales not being quite as strong as what you would have thought, but there's an incremental, and a pretty big incremental, tailwind as well in terms of going to warehouse. So I'm just trying to get your sense of how strong that guidance line item still is.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Again, just to reiterate, we're not going to give any 2018 guidance, but we are well on track to achieve those goals based on all the terrific work that's been happening around the transformation, around DSD, around Zero-Based Budgeting, Project K. So it gives us great momentum going into 2018. We just want to take the time, and for me to do exactly what you'd expect me to do, which is review all the businesses, look for the best opportunities to strike the right balance between top-line growth and what's continued to be excellent margin expansion.","Fareed A. Khan - Kellogg Co.","And, Ken, it's Fareed. Just as a reminder, that 350 basis points, the key drivers behind that were Project K and ZBB, and both of those initiatives are well in flight. The DSD exit was the largest remaining element of Project K. And as you've heard, we've got a very good line of sight. So from a cost perspective, which was really underpinning it all, we have very high confidence in delivering the two big initiatives in that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, one thing I wanted to make sure of, your biggest competitor in U.S. cookies and crackers, they talked about getting a little bit more aggressive in the fourth quarter, especially after some shelf resets, perhaps getting some incremental displays. I know you've talked in the past about losing some displays, perhaps in some parts of the store that maybe weren't critical to you in this category. I just wanted to get a sense, how much does your guidance for the fourth quarter, I guess, contemplate your competitors getting a little bit more aggressive than they were in the third quarter in that part of your business?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Hey, Ken. It's Paul. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about competitors. We're pretty much focused on doing our job and that's rebuilding momentum. And I feel good about our plan and the strength of our plan in Q4. We're reinvesting in, obviously, significant amounts of brand-building here behind a pull model. We're reinvesting in in-store promotions behind a more focused assortment and we are driving more impactful, larger displays in key positions in stores.","When you exit DSD, you're always going to lose some tertiary and secondary displays, but the benefits of shipping through warehouse is that we can drive some big impact displays across our biggest brands as we build momentum into what will be a strong Q1 as well from an innovation point of view and our ability to leverage the Power of K in-store going forward across one delivered platform. So we're focused on getting the momentum back in our brands. And our plans look very strong year-to-go.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And, John, best of luck to you.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. A question for John and Paul, can you break down the revenue shortfall this year for U.S. Morning Foods relative to your initial plan as we started the year? Just want to get a feel for, in that specific business, our revenue velocity decelerated within U.S. cereal or are we seeing decreased category distribution? Just clarity into that and how we kind of exit and look to 2018 would be a helpful color. Thank you.","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Okay. Steve. As it regards Morning Foods and cereal, specifically, we're not seeing points of distribution or things happen at a category level, per se. We are, obviously, disappointed with our performance this year. And we're not hitting our plan. We're hitting our plan on many elements around kids and productivity where we're not hitting our plan has been around our biggest adult brands. And that shortfall on brands like Mini-Wheats and Special K and, to a certain degree, Raisin Bran, is what's driving a softer category performance this year. The category's going be down between 2% and 3%. And some of that, quite frankly, is on us.","We need to now pivot and reassert our health and wellness credentials on those adult brands, increasing claims, news and innovation around those brands as we go into next year. So I've mentioned probiotics on Special K. We have news coming on Raisin Bran. And one thing we'll talk to you about in coming months is some more transformational innovation coming to the category around the area of digestive health and convenience as we look to really stimulate adult growth within the cereal category.","As you go back over time, this category has always responded, over the past 50 years, to health and wellness, whether it was fortification, fiber, oat bran, low calorie, low fat in the 1990s and 2000s. We need to drive the health credentials of the category. And that's what our plan is as we go into next year, whilst continue to drive fun and taste and versatility, and, as John said, big consumer excitement engagement through big properties and fun in-store. So that's really where we're headed. And I'm very much focused forward right now on those things.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Steve.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess my question, Steve, is really more to try and dig in a little deeper as to why you decided to join Kellogg, kind of what brought you there. And I ask this a little bit tongue in cheek, of course, just because of all the negative sentiment on the food space, overall, questions about the viability of big brands and the sustainability of margin structures and all of that, not to mention a consumer that seems more benefit-driven maybe than brand-driven than ever before. So I'd love to just get a sense of what brought you here, as you sort of assessed your next potential opportunities, to get a sense of your thoughts on some of those things that I brought up. Thank you.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yes. No, thanks, Andrew. I think the pessimism around this category and U.S. food, I think, is overdone, in my estimation. There's going to be winners, and there's going be those who don't win. And I think Kellogg is uniquely positioned to be one of the winners. You've got great brands, great food, great people here, a great culture. You're not going find a more iconic company than Kellogg.","And so the opportunity to come here was very humbling, but I also see tremendous opportunities for growth. And, as I've traveled around, I've seen those growth opportunities. They exist already. Look at Pringles globally and how well that's doing, what opportunities exist there. You hear Paul talk about the Frozen business, Eggo and Morningstar Farms; terrific brands growing very well with lots of momentum.","The emerging markets and the opportunities in emerging markets and the JVs that we formed already, tremendous opportunities for growth. And you saw what we recently did with RXBAR, filling in a space that we weren't participating in with a terrific brand that's right on-trend.","And so, as I looked at the opportunity, I saw tremendous opportunity for growth, a wonderful opportunity to join the most iconic of American companies, a great culture, love the people that I met. And so I couldn't be happier with the choice, and I see really tremendous opportunity for us moving forward.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you for that and all the best, John.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good morning. John, thank you for all the assistance over the year and good luck with your next chapter and a welcome to Steve. My question is on U.S. Snacks. Can you guys give us some sense as to the size of the volume declines that occurred after the transition? And then, when do you expect to see the benefits from higher advertising and brand-building that you're going to execute on the snack operations?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Hey, David. It's Paul. It's hard for me to give you a sense of the exact volume declines, but remember what we said coming into this. There is a 50% to 20% SKU rationalization that will obviously not have that amount of impact on our business, but will have a limited impact. We hope to gain space on some of our core items to get a more powerful assortment there.","At the same time, we said and we knew we would get fewer displays as we came out of DSD but more impactful displays. And we pulled right back on promotions and display support through a period of three to four months here to be able to operate effectively in what is a new model for the Snacks team. We have now pivoted.","Brand-building was up in Q3 and will be up much more in Q4. Our investment in promotions and in-store support with our customers is now beginning to come to life as we reinvest behind these biggest brands, and that will continue as we go into next year.","I'm optimistic we will see consumption improvement in the coming weeks and months on this business. We have a strong innovation pipeline coming at the beginning of the year, so that will accelerate into next year from a consumption point of view.","So we're now, if you like, the transition is behind us in many ways. We're now very much focused on operating effectively in a warehouse-delivered model, which we think we can do because we do it across our other businesses.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Paul, in one follow-up for me, do you have any concerns on your shelf space within the Snack business now that you're about three months since the DSD elimination? Do you have any concerns that you would lose shelf space larger than any expectation you previously had before you executed the transition?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","It's a good question, David. Our business is responding in the way we expected it to. So all of our key metrics are right where the team expected them to be. It takes a lot of work in-store to make sure tags and placement and compliance is there across 20,000-plus stores, which we used to call on twice a week. But so far so good, and we'll continue to improve as we go forward.","So there's nothing outside of our assumptions in our business case at the moment that would worry us. Like I say, we're just focused on getting back to growth with our customers and then obviously working with our customers in a new delivered environment, where we can also help them from a cost to serve point of view as we're on one platform now and build those joint value-creating plans in ways that we couldn't before, which I think will be really important looking forward.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the questions around the Snacks business in the U.S., and I guess maybe I didn't understand this correctly, but part of what I thought or what I'm expecting is that as you pulled back DSD, so all of that distribution resource into large format retailers, it frees up some resources to maybe expand into some other channels where you're under-resourced. So I guess my question is just is that still true? And if it is, as we're thinking about the timing, I guess, over the next year or two, is there a level of reinvestment that we should be thinking about that goes into sort of building more channel diversity?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Absolutely, Brian. When we laid out the business plan when we started this at the beginning of the year, this was really based on a set of consumer-based and shopper-based assumptions, which is exactly what you said. Investing money in a go-to market mechanism or operating model, the consumers don't see the benefit from, quite frankly, was not where we wanted to be. So those resources are now going into focusing on how and where the shopper shops. Whether that's brand-building in old-fashioned ways or new-fashioned ways from a shopper point of view, reaching those shoppers in whichever retail environment they choose to shop, that's exactly what we're doing.","We're also investing more resources, people resources, against where the growth channels are in our business. So we're seeing, for example, eCommerce in North America in Q3 grew over 60%. So like every company, winning where the shopper shops in new environments, be that pure play or click-and-collect is right up there on our agenda. And investing in capabilities, whether it be supply chain, marketing, sales in that environment, is where some of these dollars are going.","Also remember some of the highest growth potential brands in our portfolio, Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, these brands are going get significantly more brand-building, way up there in the double digits for the next year, as we look to accelerate those brands. Whether that's TV, media type investments, whether it's customer focused investments, whether it's capital into pack\/price format investments to make sure that we have exactly the right offering in the right channel to fit the consumers and the shoppers' needs. What we said we're doing, we're going to do, and you'll see it come through in the months to come into next year.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much. John, thanks for all. Steve, welcome. So, Steve, I was just wondering if you could give us maybe one or two examples of what you may be focused on as you step into the role at Kellogg for each of the brands and really as you think about brand investment allocation. And I'm simply asking you to see if there's anything you believe as you step into the new role, are there best practices that you can bring from your prior position to leverage Kellogg's win potential going forward? Thanks.","Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.","Yeah, thanks, Rob. I certainly hope I can bring some new thinking in best practices, but I'm also humble enough to know that I'm joining the original health and wellness company, as I said before, very iconic with fantastic brands. And again, I see tremendous opportunities in many of the brands in all the categories. Some of the questions people ask is can cereal grow. And even within that, you see the kids' brands in the U.S. becoming stable. You see a great story in the UK with Corn Flakes return turn to double-digit growth on the back of really strong marketing programs. And I'm confident if we get the adult portfolio marketed properly around contemporary health and wellness, there's even opportunity there to continue to grow that.","And then you look back at some of the areas that are already growing that I mentioned, Pringles globally, the Eggo business, Morningstar Farms, emerging markets, there's a lot of opportunities to grow this business.","And it's not that there's a dearth of opportunities where we really have to search far and wide for that little gem. There's a lot. And so we have the opportunity to really evaluate where those opportunities are, make the right resource allocation decisions, and really put the pedal down on some of these areas of high growth.","This company is not without strong brands. In fact, there's many, many brands across many categories and geographies. So I'll be spending the next 90 days really evaluating all those opportunities, evaluating the business plans. John's been a tremendous partner. We've been traveling all around the world, along with Fareed, to really evaluate these plans.","And right about the fourth quarter call, we'll be talking about 2018, where we want to take 2018. And I'm looking forward to seeing all of you at CAGNY, where we'll be more fulsome about exactly where these opportunities are and where we believe we can really create long-term value for our shareholders.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Paul, just going back to U.S. cereal, you made comments around brand-building, but it feels as though that lever has been pulled a number of times on and off over the years with protein cereals, antioxidant cereals, and with, I guess, a fairly limited impact. So do you have a sense as to where maybe cereal share of voice is in the breakfast space relative to where it's been historically? And just given how the daypart's been bifurcating, are the brand-building levers also bifurcating, where any approach is maybe less incremental, in terms of its impact, overall? How do you think about the returns there on those efforts and where you invest going forward?","Paul T. Norman - Kellogg Co.","Thanks, John. As I look forward on our portfolio, as I emphasized, it's less about absolute money or share of voice as it used to be. It's more about getting the right ideas behind the right brands. We have a great set of existing core brands, the Core 6, as we call them. They cover 70% of the needs when it comes to the category, number one. We have to up our game on brands like Mini-Wheats, Special K, and Raisin Bran to bring, as Steve said, contemporary health and wellness credentials to those brands. We're down the track on Special K. And we're seeing the brand begin to respond, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And we're bringing more, in the way of probiotics to Special K next year.","Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats, we can do a lot more to pull out the wellness credentials of those brands and talk to consumers about them. This isn't category work, per se. This is brand work relevant to consumer needs, brand-on-brand.","I've spoken before about how the category's always been driven over time, actually through nutrition. Whether it was fortification back in the 1950s, fiber, oat bran in the 1970s and 1980s, and then for a long while here, low calorie, low fat drove the Special K brand in particular and the category for years.","Now, I believe gut health and science is coming back to nutrition and nutrition in the cereal category. We're well placed as a category to actually find tailwinds in nutrition in the months and years to come. It's good for cereal and it's good for our emphasis on health and wellness. You add the Kashi brands and the Kashi business to that as well and we have a on-trend set of brands, I think, for the 10 years to come.","The critical thing, though, is finding great commercial ideas, renovation and innovation that can bring to life those trends in unique ways for our brands. Our portfolio and our category is uniquely placed to do that. It's incumbent on us to do it. So that's really where our focus is.","35%,36% of the cereal consumption in the U.S. today happens outside of the breakfast occasion. That trend's only increasing and will only continue to increase as you think of demographics and age cohorts going forward here. And so we are agnostic to what time of day we communicate the benefits of our foods. And we'll communicate to everybody, wherever they are throughout the day, these benefits. We've had great success with some of our kid brands against millennials in certain dayparts, like the evening, and we will continue to drive our portfolio where it makes sense to fit people's days.","The final thing I'll mention is we do need to still bring transformational innovation to cereal, okay, and to the breakfast occasion, which means investing more, maybe, in new alternatives in the area of digestive health and\/or convenience. And we're working hard on that. And hopefully, you'll see some transformational innovation ideas come out of our company over the next few months here that show that we are investing to grow our business across these key categories.","John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.","Operator, because we're at the end of the call, we want to bring it back to John Bryant for some final comments.","John A. Bryant - Kellogg Co.","Thank you for your questions, everybody. On a personal note, I'd like to thank all of you in the investment community for your support and engaging discussions over the years. You're in very good hands with Steve, who I firmly believe will transform and successfully lead this great company into the future.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Thank you. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Simon Burton, Kellog Company Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Burton, you may begin your conference, sir.","Simon Burton","Great, thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for a review of our second quarter 2013 results. I'm joined here today by John Bryant, President and CEO; Ron Dissinger, Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Norman, President of Kellogg International, who has been primarily focused on stabilizing and turning around our European business over the last year. The press release and slide that support our remarks this morning are posted on our website at www.kellogcompany.com.","As you're aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, including earnings per share, net sales, margin, operating profit, interest expense, tax rate, cash flow, brand building, upfront costs, investments and inflation are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the second slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. As a reminder, a replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Monday, August 5. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for 90 days.","And now, I'll turn it over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. As you have seen, today we announced results for the second quarter, which is the final quarter that we will be affected by comparisons to periods before we earned Pringles. Results met our expectations for both operating profit and earnings in the quarter. Underlying reported operating profit increased by 11% and underlying internal operating profit increased by 3.4%. However, sales growth was slower than we expected. As you've seen in recent public consumption data, some of the larger categories in which we compete, particularly in the U.S., saw lower rates of growth in the quarter. We continue to expect good rates of long-term growth from our categories, but we recognize the short-term weakness that we've seen and have taken a pragmatic approach with guidance.","We just launched increased levels of innovation that will add to results in the second half, and we're increasing rates of advertising, particularly in the third quarter. So we expect improvement, but realize that it could be a slower process through the balance of the year than we originally expected.","We're on track to achieve our guidance for currency-neutral earnings per share as a result of continued good performance from Pringles and the work we've been doing on our cost base. This will allow us to cover the impact of the sales outlook, while continuing to invest in the future growth of the business. This is important as we continue to focus on our margins and plan for further investment in the future.","Let's turn to Slide 4 and a quick update on the Pringles acquisition. As you know, we've now owned Pringles for more than a year. So our third quarter 2013 results will be lapping the fourth full [ph] quarter of ownership last year. We've made great progress with the integration. The transition service agreements that we had with Procter & Gamble have now all ended, and the business is operating on Kellogg's systems. This was a major initiative, as this acquisition was a carve-out, which required us to quickly integrate the business into our structure. The entire organization, including the Kellogg business units, the new employees that joined us from Pringles and the transition team, have all done a great job. Thanks too to P&G for all their help throughout the transition.","Reported global sales increased in a low double-digit rate in Q2, reflecting a difficult comparison due to pre-close adjustments in the second quarter of last year. However, we saw good underlying rates of consumption growth. For example, consumption in the U.S. increased by approximately 7% in the quarter. And as you know, the business has continued to run smoothly all year. Our sales and marketing execution has been good and the sales growth we've seen has exceeded our expectations. We saw more accretion than we originally anticipated in the first half and we're tracking to the higher end of our synergy range for the full year.","This is a great brand with untapped potential. We are increasing innovation and investing in capacity and we have visibility into improving margins over time. So I'd just like to thank everyone involved in the acquisition and the transition for all their hard work.","Now I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 is a recap of our performance for the quarter and year-to-date. Reported sales growth was 6.9% and internal sales declined by 0.5%. We've owned Pringles from June 1, 2012, so Pringles adds the benefit of 2 months of sales and profits to our reported results. We saw some weakness in several segments in the U.S. and trade inventory declined in several regions around the world. But we had solid results in Latin America, Asia Pacific and in Frozen Foods and Specialty in the U.S.","Underlying reported operating profit increased by 10.9%, which included a benefit from lower Pringles integration costs. Underlying internal operating profit, which excludes the impact of the acquisition of Pringles, increased by 3.4%, as we expected, and included the impact of cost inflation net of productivity in our supply chain, as well as effective management of costs and some timing in SG&A.","And finally, comparable earnings per share, which excludes integration costs, was $1, in line with our expectations. Comparable growth was 5.3% and this included a $0.02 adverse impact from currencies.","Slide 6 shows the components of the quarter's 6.9% reported sales growth. Internal volume declined 1.6%, with nearly 1\/2 of the decline being driven by trade inventory reductions in the U.S., France and Mexico. It's worth noting that we saw a good volume growth in our Asia-Pacific region and we did see price mix improvement in the quarter across most of the regions. Of course, Pringles is the primary driver of the 7.9 points of growth related to acquisitions in the second quarter.","While we expect that our innovation will contribute to results in the second half of the year, we do expect that sales growth will continue to be a bit slower for the balance of the year than we originally anticipated. I'll provide more detail regarding our outlook later.","Finally, currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.5 point in the quarter.","Slide 7 shows the shape of the net inflation we'll see this year and it's the slide that we showed you last quarter. You remember that we recognized net cost inflation in the first half of the year, and as you can see on the chart, we continue to expect net deflation in the second half of the year, which should provide a benefit to our gross margins.","We have better visibility into our cost structure for the balance of the year and now expect a small amount of net inflation in the third quarter and a net deflation in the fourth quarter.","The slower sales growth we have seen so far this year has led to reduced operating leverage. We saw the impact of this in the second quarter and expect it to have an impact on margins in the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter. In the second quarter, our underlying reported gross margin declined by 140 basis points. Of this, approximately 50 basis points was due to the impact of the Pringles acquisition and approximately 90 basis points was due to the impact of net inflation, operating leverage and some country and product mix.","Slide 8 highlights some of the brand building activity we have planned for the second half of the year. Obviously, this is just a small sample, but it highlights the breadth of activity we expect in the business. As you know, we launched a significant amount of innovation around midyear, and we will support these products over the balance of 2013 with strong support planned for the third quarter.","As we've mentioned a few times over the past year, we have been doing a lot of work increasing the efficiency of our investment in brand building. This work continued in the second quarter, and we have seen encouraging results. This work included savings in working media through mix improvements, digital purchasing, negotiations and the moves to pan-regional purchasing.","We have also realized savings in non-working media by leveraging copy across multiple markets where practical. And in addition, we've done a lot of work with consumer promotions around the world. As a result, we expect that advertising will be up in the second half and flat to up for the full year despite the savings that I have mentioned.","Now, let's turn to Slide 9, which shows quarterly internal operating profit performance for each of the regions. Overall, total company underlying internal operating profit growth of 3.4% was broadly in line with our expectations. And underlying operating margins were solid at 15.5%, up more than 50 basis points from last year.","North America's internal operating profit increased by 3.2%, a sequential improvement from the first quarter. We saw a good cost discipline and we benefited from Pringles synergies. The Morning Foods, Specialty and North America Other segment, which includes Frozen Foods and Canada, all posted operating profit growth. Operating profit in the Snacks business was flat due to sales performance.","We have a stronger innovation pipeline and increased advertising planned for the second half of the year in North America, although we do expect the environment to remain challenging.","Internal operating profit grew by 1.8% in Europe and included a mid-single-digit increase in advertising. The restaging of Special K across Europe that we've spoken about before began in the U.K. in Northern Europe at the end of the second quarter, and we've seen early signs of improvement.","Internal operating profit in Latin America decreased by 8.3% in the quarter, due to significant commodity inflation and the impact from reductions in retailer inventories. Much of this is behind us, so we expect improved performance in Latin America across the second half of the year.","And then Asia Pacific, we saw an increase in internal operating profit of 11.3%. Growth was driven by solid sales across key businesses and included increased levels of advertising.","Slide 10 provides detail of our year-to-date cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations before capital spending was $705 million in the first half of the year. This was an increase of $25 million from the first half of last year. And remember, we benefited last year from the structure of the Pringles transaction with the addition of approximately $100 million of cash flow in the second quarter of 2012.","Capital spending was $238 million, an increase of $83 million over the first half of last year and in line with our plan. We still expect to spend slightly more than 4% of sales for the full year.","And we have now repurchased more than $500 million of shares so far this year. We still expect to repurchase shares in line with proceeds from options for the full year. Our share repurchases in the first quarter were well below options proceeds. And while we are currently tracking ahead of proceeds for the year-to-date period, we expect that this will balance out as we progress through the second half.","Now let's look at Slide 11, which shows our guidance for 2013. Due to the slower sales growth we saw in the second quarter, expectations for the remainder of the year and increased currency headwinds, we now expect that reported sales growth will be approximately 5%, 2 points lower than our original guidance. The decline in sales growth is split evenly, 1 point from currency and 1 point from internal growth expectation. Although our underlying reported earnings per share has come down by 2 points, our currency-neutral earnings per share is consistent with original guidance. We have been able to manage the 1 point of internal sales shortfall through improved performance from Pringles and disciplined cost management. We haven't changed our estimate for full year cost inflation at approximately 5% and cost savings of around 4%, but inflation is a little lower and savings are slightly higher. And as I mentioned, we still expect to see net deflation in the second half as a result of lower cost pressures and slightly higher cost savings.","We now expect the gross margin for the full year will be down 75 to 100 basis points, a change from our original guidance of down 50 basis points. Pringles is still contributing approximately 50 basis points to the decline, due to the lower margin structure.","Slide 12 shows more detail regarding our full year earnings per share guidance. Previously, we gave guidance for underlying earnings per share growth of between 5% and 7%. This included a $0.02 negative impact from currency. We always expected currency neutral earnings per share growth, excluding integration costs, to be between 6% and 9% or $3.84 to $3.93 per share, and that has not changed. However, over the course of the last quarter, currencies have moved against us more significantly. This means that instead of a full year negative impact of $0.02, we now expect the impact to be $0.09. Our guidance for reported earnings per share has gone from 5% to 7% growth to 3% to 5% growth. This change is completely due to the $0.07 extra headwind in currencies. Obviously, currency translation will remain volatile, so I'll update you regarding the effect as the year progresses.","Now let's go to Slide 13 in some additional detail on our guidance. As we mentioned last quarter, we expected that estimates for the full year tax rate might improve, and that has been the case. We now expect that the full year tax rate will be between 29% and 30%. We continue to expect that interest expense will be between $230 million and $240 million. We still expect annual cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion and total capital spending to be slightly more than 4% of sales.","In the second half, we have increased innovation, more advertising and Pringles will be included in the base. As for the phasing of earnings over the remainder of the year, we expect reported earnings per share, including the impact of currency but excluding integration costs, to be roughly equal in the third and fourth quarters. Our current expectations are that integration costs and the impact to currencies will be approximately balanced between the third and fourth quarters.","As has been the case all year, our guidance for comparable operating profit and earnings per share excludes the impact of adjustments from mark to market.","And finally, on Pringles, we continue to expect that integration costs will be between $0.12 and $0.14 per share, but synergies will be toward the high end of our $50 million to $75 million range for the year.","And now I'll turn it back over to John for a discussion of our segments.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Ron. Slide 14 shows the internal net sales growth posted by Kellogg North America. As we mentioned, performance was mixed in the quarter.","Let's look at the segments in more detail starting with Slide 15 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. Growth in the cereal category in the second quarter was disappointing. Although we did expect it to be challenging given the timing of innovation, scheduled for launch at midyear, and the need for additional activity. Special K saw consumption growth of approximately 2% in the quarter as a result of growth posted by Special K Protein, which we relaunched in the second half of last year and Special K Chocolate Strawberry, which launched this year. Frosted Flakes continued to perform well as did Raisin Bran. We saw a high single-digit consumption growth as a result of our recent healthy dividends campaign. Healthy dividends has targeted adult health-conscious consumers and focuses on bringing boomers into the cereal category. For example, the campaign highlights the benefits that come from a balanced diet, including cereal and a healthy lifestyle.","As I mentioned last quarter, we've seen some weakness in the adult cereal segment. In addition to the healthy dividends campaign, we also have innovation that will help to address this, including Raisin Bran containing Omega-3, Kashi Cheer Heart to Heart and Multi-Grain Special K.","Special K is a great brand that travels well around the world. So in addition to all the activity I've mentioned, we've also just launched Special K Nourish Hot Cereals in the U.S. And as you'll hear from Paul, we're also launching Hot Cereals in Europe.","In the U.S., we've launched 3 varieties, which are a healthy blend of oats and grains, including quinoa. They also include inclusions such as cranberries, which you add after preparation. We've only just introduced these cereals, but acceptance has been good and we have activity planned for the fall. We've also launched Kellogg's breakfast beverages and off to an encouraging start. ECV is good and brand building has started. Obviously, it's early but we're optimistic that these will be successful and will generate a meaningful amount of incremental sales growth.","Finally, Pop-Tarts had an excellent quarter. Consumption increased at a mid-single-digit rate. We introduced 2 kinds of peanut butter Pop-Tarts in May. And again, although it's early, both are exceeding our expectations.","Now let's turn to Slide 16, which shows the internal net sales performance of the U.S. Snacks segment. The segment posted an internal sales decline on the most difficult comparison of the year. Internal sales in the cracker business were down slightly, partially because we were lapping very strong growth from Special K Cracker Chips last year. However, we've seen improvement in distribution and quality merchandising in the business in recent weeks, and the innovation we launched around midyear is off to good start. Cheez-It Zings and Town House Pita are both getting good rates of trial and we're selling all the crackers in our new cup packaging that we can make.","The cookie business also declined in the quarter. Again, the innovations we've just launched, including Keebler Simply Made cookies, Jumbo Fudge Shoppe and Cookies In A Cup are all off to a good start. And the decline we saw in the wholesome snacks business was at least partially due to the strong 7% sales growth posted last year.","We did see some good growth this quarter from Special K Pastry Crisps and new Nutri-Grain crunch bars also contributed.","Our Pringles business saw a good consumption growth of approximately 7% in the quarter, which outpaced the category's growth and we gained share as a result. The core grew and our Pringles Stix innovation also added to the results. We've got good activity planned for the second half and more innovation planned for introduction toward the end of the year.","We always knew the second quarter would be a difficult one for the Snacks business. We've got innovation that's just launched and more coming. This, in combination with additional support and Pringles now being included in internal sales growth, should help results in the second half. Of course, it will continue to be a difficult environment, and we continue to expect that improvement will take some time.","Slide 17 shows the net sales performance of the U.S. Specialty segment. We posted internal net sales growth of 1.9% in the second quarter. We posted good results in the Convenience channel, driven by cereal in a cup and our 5 SKUs of Special K Cracker Chips in single-serve packs, which is doing very well. We've just launched Special K Nourish Bars in this channel and have more innovation planned for later in the year.","In addition, our Foodservice business has good plans for the second half of the year, and we're optimistic that the Specialty Channels business as a whole will improve over the balance of the year.","Finally, Pringles, which has done very well in these channels since the acquisition, continued to post growth in the quarter, and our expectations are for continued good performance in the second half.","Slide 18 shows detail regarding the North America Other segment, which includes the Canadian and U.S. Frozen Food businesses. The segment posted 3.9% internal sales growth in the quarter. In Canada, we've seen some good results from innovation, including share gains in the Frozen category as a result of the launch of Special K Flatbread sandwiches and Eggo Minis waffles, growth in crackers due to the introduction of Special K Cracker Chips and good early performance from breakfast beverages.","We saw a high single-digit internal sales growth in the Frozen Foods business in the quarter. We saw good volume growth in the frozen breakfast business and also posted gains in price mix. Growth in the frozen breakfast business was driven by the continued success of the Special K Flatbread sandwiches, and we've got a new version being introduced later this year.","Now let's move to the international business. As you know, we've had a difficult start to 2012 in Europe. We've been doing a lot of work over the last year to stabilize the business and we saw growth at the end of last year and early this year.","So now, I'd like to turn it over to Paul Norman, who will provide more color regarding our plans for the European business.","Paul T. Norman","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Back in November at Day at K, we discussed some of issues affecting performance in Europe over the past few years and we shared our strategy to change all that, highlighting 3 key where to play choices: One, sustainably grow cereal in and beyond the bowl; two, explosively grow snacks; and three, accelerate growth in select emerging markets.","To win, we said we would need to operate differently by designing for scale, by developing and executing ideas at a pan-European level.","Finally, to enable this, we needed to reorganize the way we worked. The acquisition of Pringles provided the catalyst for us to do so. Several months on, and Pringles is now integrated. The region is organized around 2 category hubs, namely cereal and snacks. And we are bringing pan-European ideas to market in cereal, in and beyond the bowl and in snacks, as well as increasing levels of investment in key emerging markets. Our overall rate of innovation will increase significantly in 2013, and we have good visibility to 2014 and beyond.","I would like to run quickly through a few slides on key initiatives coming in the back half of 2013.","Let's start with cereal on Slide 20. In the second half, we will be looking to drive momentum behind key adult brands. On Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes, our leading taste brand in the U.K., we will accelerate momentum via new advertising from the proven \"the trouble is they taste too good\" campaign, as well as with innovation in the form of the recently launched Glorious Oat Granola and soon-to-be launched chocolate curls variety. In France and Italy, the Extra brand will benefit from an all-new advertising campaign backed by significant year-on-year increases in investment.","Finally, in the U.K., Spain and the Nordic region, we will be launching the 5-day challenge on All-Bran, offering consumers faster, more effective relief from digestive discomfort.","Moving on to Slide 21. We will also continue to reinvigorate our largest brand, Special K. As you know, we launched renovated base food, including whole grain and fiber in recent quarters. And this rollout continues in more countries, as we speak.","We are expanding our presence within the cereal category to Hot Cereal. With the launch of Special K Multi-Grain porridge coming to selected countries in September.","A differentiated food offering in 3 varieties and 2 different packaging formats, we feel confident we will attract new users to the Special K brand over the coming months. As 2014 comes, we will be expanding further into additional formats in various parts of the region with the Special K brand. More to come on this soon.","Moving to Slide 22. Our aim is also to compete more broadly in breakfast beyond the bowl. As a result, we are just launching on the continent a full range of new Nutri-Grain handheld breakfast solutions. We recognize that sometimes consumers don't have time for a bowl of cereal and milk. That's why we developed foods that provide the benefits of cereal in a portable and convenient format that better meets their needs. These are delicious, toastable and dunkable whole-grain foods designed to better fit the local breakfast occasion. The range will include breakfast biscuits but also unique, new to market propositions too, including toastable pastries.","Now, let's talk snacks on Slide 23. First up is Pringles, where things continue to go well. Following another quarter of mid-single-digit consumption growth driven by some great in-store focus from our local sales teams, selected innovations like the Xtra subline and continued geographic expansion in emerging markets, we feel good about the future. We're adding capacity in 2014 to further fuel the brand in terms of growth in existing geographies and in new ones and to enable a strong pipeline of innovation that you will hear more about in the coming months.","Moving to Slide 24 on Special K snacks and an update on a couple of key pan-European initiatives. Firstly, Biscuit Moments, which we launched in the U.K. last year and now can be found across the region in 2013. This is a great example of an idea designed and delivered consistently across the region and it's an idea that has worked in other regions, too.","For example, this idea was launched in the U.S. under the Special K Pastry Crisps brand and has been doing very well. Another example is Special K Cracker Crisps, which are shown on Slide 25 and which will roll out across the region later this year. These are similar to the Special K Cracker Chips you will know in the U.S. This idea has obviously been successful and has now traveled to Europe but has also now been launched in Canada, Mexico and soon in Australia, too.","So when you put it all together, on Slide 26, you will see a good cross-section of activity in and beyond the bowl of breakfast and an exciting set of initiatives across snacks to accelerate growth. And all of this is being done with the benefits of scale, both in development and delivery.","To close, I pulled back my summary slide from Day at K last year in November. We continue to transform our company in Europe into a cereal and a snacking company, leveraging ideas with scale across the region by operating differently. Change takes time and effort, and I would like to recognize the entire team in Europe for what they're doing to make it happen and bring our strategy to life.","Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to John.","John A. Bryant","Thanks, Paul. Now, let's turn to Slide 28 in our other international businesses. Internal net sales increased by 4.1% in Asia Pacific in the second quarter, driven by strong volume growth. The Australian business contributed to this growth as the breakfast drinks we launched last year continue to do well. Nutri-Grain, our core cereal brand in Australia, gained category share in the quarter, and we've got more innovation planned for introduction in Australia, including Special K Cracker Chips, which is similar to the ones you know in the U.S.","In Asia, we saw good growth in India, Southeast Asia and South Africa. South Africa posted double-digit net sales growth as the Corn Flakes brand, including Corn Flakes Porridge, did very well. We also saw double-digit growth in India, due to strong growth from Chocos, Muesli and the Special K brand. And Pringles also posted mid-single-digit sales growth in the quarter, driven by both volume growth and price realization.","The Latin American business posted 5% internal sales growth, although this included some unusual items, including the reduction of trade inventories, as I've mentioned before. Without these items, both sales and operating profit growth would have been much higher. The economic environment in Mexico remains difficult but cereal consumption growth remains good. We've had some recent gains in distribution and cost of innovation is working well and we've got more plans for introduction before the end of the year. We also saw growth in Brazil, the Andean region, Venezuela and Chile. And Pringles also did well in the quarter, exceeding our expectations.","Now let's turn to Slide 29 and the summary. We met our goals to operating profit and earnings in the second quarter. We have better plans for the second half, including more innovation and increased levels of advertising. However, we recognize that the difficult environment we saw in the first half will continue through the balance of the year. We have completed the majority of the Pringles integration and the business is performing very well. And we have reaffirmed our full year target for earnings, excluding the impact of currency translation.","So finally, I'd like to say thank you to all the Kellogg employees around the world for all their hard work and dedication. Together, we're building the plans and laying the foundation necessary for future growth. And now, we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Would you please comment on the cereal merchandising outlook? It seems like General Mills captured a lot of merchandising activity during your second quarter period. Can you just give us some comments on how you see the merchandising outlook in North America for the rest of the year?","John A. Bryant","David, it's very hard to predict how the merchandising activity will change as we go through the back half of the year. What I'll say on cereals, we're focused on driving our business the way that we've seen the business respond historically, which is through brand building, innovation, both food and packaging, as well as nutrition. I believe that's the right way to drive the cereal business. Obviously, cereal is always an intensely competitive category. We'll be competitive in that category. But I wouldn't say that there's any trends around merchandising that concern us.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Related to the -- to cereal category on new products, how have the new products performed and would you call this out as a reason for the soft sales in any way? Or more importantly, are the new products more of a second half event? Maybe if you could help me out a little on that on?","John A. Bryant","David, the new products are really a second half event. They only started shipping towards the end of the second quarter, and the brand building won't be turned on until we get well into the third quarter and we have the right level of distribution across the U.S. stores.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question for me is just a detail on advertising. What was the advertising change during the second quarter?","Ronald L. Dissinger","So David, this is Ron. Our advertising was down just slightly in the second quarter, and that was a function of the innovation -- timing of innovation launches that John mentioned. So we do expect advertising growth in the third quarter.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So then the nice operating margin performance relative to the gross margin was not related to like a giant decline in advertising? It was other factors, namely Pringles, savings and\/or other savings? Is that correct?","Ronald L. Dissinger","And\/or other savings. David, particularly we've been very focused and cost disciplined around overhead. We've executed some initiatives early in the year knowing that we were facing high inflation in the front part of the year.","Operator","And next, we have Bryan Spillane, Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one clarification and a question. I think Ron, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that in facing the back half of the year, the third quarter earnings would be the same as the fourth quarter. I just want make sure it's clear. Is that the absolute? Or is it the year-on-year growth rates that you're referring to?","Ronald L. Dissinger","That is the absolute earnings per share, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a question on Pringles. It's been an important sort of revenue growth contributor since the acquisition and profit growth contributor since the acquisition and still -- and it's an important component as we look into the second half, especially now that becomes internal -- part of the internal calculation. Can you talk a little bit about first, sort of where you stand today on capacity, whether you're capacity constrained at all? And then second, now that you're completely free from the Procter's shared service arrangement, how effective you've been at filling in some of the whitespace, so the markets where you've had to sort of find-your-own distribution now that you've kind of pulled away from Procter? So just those 2 things as we look at Pringles going forward, please.","John A. Bryant","Thanks for the question, Bryan. I'm going to answer the very high level, then Paul might end up with some questions on Europe -- or some comments on Europe, specifically around Pringles. First, as you said, the Pringles acquisition has gone incredibly well for us. The integration is largely complete, where now Pringles is operating on our systems and that's enabling us to generate the synergies that we're seeing come through on the cost side. So remember, a lot of the cost synergies from Pringles was unhooking the P&G shared activity, hooking it on to the Kellogg systems and support processes and be able to run the business without adding a lot of additional cost. We're absolutely seeing that come through. Also when we acquired the business, we were concerned about the top line growth of the business given that's been through a difficult transition. So we were relatively conservative in setting out top line growth expectations. The good news is this business has responded incredibly well to our merchandising, with our sales force and bring to life those programs in store. So that's working very well for us. As you pointed out, we have been capacity constrained in this business. We do have new capacity coming on. We've also been able to run the plants a little bit harder and get more capacity out of them, which has also worked well in terms of supplying the market. So as we look at Pringles around the world from a consumption perspective, in the second quarter, we saw 7% growth in the U.S., good growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America and also some very good growth in Europe. In terms of the whitespaces, there's some good Pringles opportunities in Europe as well. So why don't I let Paul just talk a little bit about the Pringles experience in Europe?","Paul T. Norman","Bryan, if you think about outside of the Kellogg go-to-market salespeople and you think further, a feel into emerging markets, remember, Pringles for us was pretty transformational in several markets. It will have almost doubled the size of our business. So we find ourselves today with a great opportunity. We have Kellogg distributors and we inherited Pringles' distributors. The process we're going through now, as you can imagine, is to consolidate, given our newfound scale to, drive more capability to go further to grow. And obviously, there's cost to serve benefits to come. So I don't think the business has been left exposed anywhere. In fact, we've ended up with more distributors than we probably have before. And the opportunities now, I would say, in emerging markets and Europe but also the same case of Latin America and parts of Southeast Asia, the opportunity to consolidate, build capability and hopefully improve cost to serve and invest to grow further.","Operator","Next, we have Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was curious about the gross margin guidance coming down to, I guess, a decline of 75 to 100 basis points. And the grain cost futures markets would indicate that -- and you said it yourself that your costs are lower than you thought and your productivity seems to be coming in lower than you thought. So is this an issue where it's just a volume and deleveraging is causing gross margin to be lighter than you thought? And then I had a question on Kashi consolidation.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Yes. Rob, it's really a factor of our operating leverage. So we have very good visibility to our cost structure as we look at back half of the year, seeing our net deflation in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned. A little bit of inflation in the third quarter, and that's because of the operating leverage impact as a result of the sales coming down in a couple of the key U.S. businesses. So it's nothing more than that. Pringles is still about 50 basis points dilutive impact on the margin as well. So the underlying margin is down about 25 to 50 basis points.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then regarding Kashi, I heard that you've consolidated headquarters into Battle Creek. Can you talk a little bit about the cost benefit of that? Kashi had a very strong culture in La Jolla and sales have been weak lately. When do you think performance will improve and what are you doing internally to make sure that you retain what made it strong to begin with?","John A. Bryant","We think Kashi is a great opportunity for us to drive additional growth. I think the opportunity with Kashi is to play its role within our portfolio. One of the benefits of having it viewed within the broader Kellogg portfolio is we can more clearly have some Kellogg brands play in some places and then Kashi play where it needs to play. An opportunity for Kashi is really in the area of pioneering nutrition, putting the value back in the food, whether it be GMO or organic or new age grains, et cetera. And that's the opportunity that Kashi can play. And by having it viewed within that broader portfolio, we can actually more clearly define and articulate the job that we need Kashi to go out and achieve for us. Now also Kashi now is a very large business and we can more effectively leverage the scale and benefits of the Kellogg Company by putting it into the broader context of Kellogg. So we feel very good about the longer-term growth opportunity for Kashi. And if anything, we think this gives us a better opportunity to achieve its long-term growth potential.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, one thing I haven't heard from you yet on Pringles is the revenue synergies that you expect a little longer term. I think you started to talk about it qualitatively but not quantitatively. And obviously, you bought Pringles for -- not for its cost savings but for the revenue potential. So perhaps, let's start with that.","John A. Bryant","Eric, I think there are significant revenue synergies coming out of the Pringles acquisition. We've not quantified those for external purposes, but think of it in a number of waves. The first wave is a benefit of putting Pringles into the Kellogg sales system and driving our initial growth. That's what we're seeing come through. The second wave is a little bit dependent upon broader capacity coming online for Pringles, which is innovation on the Pringles business itself. And there's a third wave out there, which we're also going after aggressively, which is leveraging the Pringles infrastructure to drive Kellogg's snacks more aggressively around the world. I think Europe is a great example of where we're doing a lot of that today.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, I'd just say I think it would be helpful at some point, sooner versus later, if you could give some quantification on that. And then this is a, I think, a question that's been asked in the past. But given the poor core results out of the business versus your advertising spend relative to sales, you've talked for a couple of years about \"optimizing your advertising spend.\" But the reality is despite a lot of new products and effort, the core business volume has been pretty weak for an extended period, whether it's Europe or U.S. or what have you. And I just -- I kind of wonder like, I mean, what would sales at your company be like if, God forbid, your advertising spend wasn't nearly as strong as it is? I mean, why isn't such high spending giving a better lift to the portfolio? I just -- it still makes me scratch my head.","John A. Bryant","Eric, we're very comfortable with the level of advertising we spend as a company. And that advertising is becoming even more effective and efficient each year as we drive more into digital and we activate the brands even more effectively through those programs. If you look at where some of our weakness has been on the volume side, it's really been back in cereal. So as we think about cereal, and this is true in the U.S. and some of the other large developed markets we have around the world, the good news for cereal is the breakfast occasion is, in general, growing, particularly here in the U.S. And within breakfast, cereal has the single largest share. And there's reasons to believe that there's long-term growth potential in the cereal category, whether it be Asian population, health and wellness or desire for value. However, there has been some short-term pressure over the last couple of years on the cereal category from alternatives at the breakfast occasion. So how are we addressing that as a company? Because this will help us get back to volume growth long term. One is to win with cereal at breakfast. And we take adult, which is the biggest source of opportunity, we're driving increased adult consumption around cereal, moving with 4 levers: innovation, advertising, food and packaging. And innovation, as you can see here and this year, there's Special K Multi-Grain, Kashi Cheer, Raisin Bran Omega-3 coming out. On advertising to your question, about advertising effectiveness, the healthy dividends program was in place in the second quarter. It drove strong growth in Raisin Bran, which was heroed in that particular piece of advertising. On foods, as we mentioned before, in Kashi, our focus is on pioneering health. And we're seeing the benefits, again, to food right. We have seen Bear Naked growing double digits in the second quarter. And then on packaging, whether it be resealable bags, easy-open liners or more portable solutions like cups, all helps us drive that cereal consumption. And it's more than just winning with cereal breakfast. It's also winning in breakfast beyond cereal. So we have a number of warm breakfast alternative, such as Eggo, Pop-Tarts, the Special K breakfast sandwiches. And now we have Special K Hot Cereal launching both in the U.S. and in U.K. And within that as well, we're looking at portability, whether it be wholesome snacks, hand-held breakfast that Paul mentioned in Europe, or breakfast beverages here in the U.S. So we're confident we can do both in the breakfast occasion. We can grow cereal at breakfast as we did across the 2000s and we can leverage our strong cereal brands into other formats to meet consumer needs at that breakfast occasion. And we believe if we do this well, we can get ourselves back to volume growth as a company.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, I think that the general expectation to your earlier -- just the answer you just gave, by many investors, is that the cereal category will ultimately bounce back to a rate of growth, whether it's the low single-digit rate that it's had historically, even though thus far that recovery has been slower than you would have liked. But if this slower cereal category growth rate continues for a bit of time or longer than planned, I guess, do Kellogg and the investment community have to wait through perhaps a longer period of profit pressure as you launch and transition to a lot of this new outside the bowl initiatives and formats? As necessary as they may be, but requires spending and may have potentially negative mix issues given the excellent profitability of your core cereal franchise. So I guess in other words, can Kellogg's long-term EPS growth target of 7% to 9% be hit and sustained during a transition like I've described and as you talked about in your -- just in the previous answer?","John A. Bryant","I think it's definitely our intent to, over the long term, get back on a sustainable growth model. We are making the investments we need to make in order to get back on that model and we recognize the need to drive our growth more aggressively in the cereal and breakfast occasion, and we're making the investments we need to make. What I think you're seeing within that investment model is we are using cereal equities to help drive our growth in some of the non-cereals spaces. So for example, leveraging the Kellogg master brands, launch the Kellogg to-go beverages in the U.S. That would then enable us to have a more efficient investment model, so we don't need to add a significant amount of additional brand building in order to drive that growth. This will hail us back on the cereal business as well. At the same time, within the advertising line, we continue to move money between digital, consumer databases and so on, which makes that spending even more efficient, which also enables us to free up investment. Also, we'll continue to look within our company on the cost side to be more effective and efficient to identify opportunities, to provide fuel for growth in our organization going forward.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I know that you switched over to using a third-party broker for some of the in-store work around your Morning Foods business, I think, maybe back in April or so. Just trying to get a sense if that transition has gone relatively smoothly. I don't know if you've got any metrics to point to around distribution or merchandising effectiveness. But has it basically delivered on what you had hoped you'd get from it?","John A. Bryant","Andrew, I think any transition like that always has its bumps early in the process, but I feel like it's working very well today.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask you first on the revenue growth for the business and looking out, I think what I heard from you so far, I think we heard this consistent theme, is a very heavy level of innovation, marketing and it's picking up in the second half of the year. I had assumed some of that started in Q2. I think a little bit it sounds like it started late in the quarter. I guess, what I'm getting too, John, is it as simple as you'd increase your marketing even more, your advertising? Or do you think these new products is what's going to help fix, what are, in some cases a category issue, like in cereal or just the competitive or slower dynamic, in say, cookies and crackers in the U.S.?","John A. Bryant","I believe that the innovation we're putting in the marketplace here in the second half, as well as the commercial plans we have in the second half, will lead to a better sales growth rate in the second half than what we had in the first half. I also believe it's going to take more innovation and pressure over time to get the categories fully back into the growth rates we'd like to see. So this is not a short-term easy fix. This is a longer-term journey that we're on. But we're absolutely doing the right thing. So we've seen the ability to grow these categories over time back in the 2000s, and it's a case of engaging and exciting the consumer and bringing them back in.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up to that. You've had a fairly heavy level of productivity savings this year and it sounds like it's a little higher than maybe what you thought initially. Is there anything unique that's helping drive that? And I guess, a lot of us remember back to periods where the supply-chain maybe just cut a little too far. So I'm just trying to understand what's driving that and how sustainable this level of savings is.","Ronald L. Dissinger","Now the tick-up in savings, productivity savings is only slight, Chris. It's not significant. So we're quite comfortable with the programs that are in place and the things that the supply-chain is doing to generate their savings.","John A. Bryant","And Chris, on the supply chain, I feel very good about the state of our supply chain. The investments that we've made over the last 2 years have enabled us to run these plants even more effectively. And quite frankly, the work that we did on those plants is enabling to run even more efficiently this year, and that's a little bit of a source of some of the productivity benefits.","Operator","Next, we have Jason English, Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","More innovation coming to try and rejuvenate growth. We've been hearing a lot about innovation for a number of years now. If we look at the cereal category, which is clearly a point of weakness, TDP growth suggests it's been pretty explosive expansion of the varieties in the category. Meanwhile, velocity is falling off a cliff. Why shouldn't we be bracing for maybe some skew rationalization in that category rather than banking on innovation to turn it around?","John A. Bryant","Well, Jason, I think that in a category like cereal, which is a high repertoire in category, you always have a level of innovation and a level of ongoing rationalization on the shelf. So the shelf is not growing and it's not declining. It is an element of bringing new news to the category and continuing to bring consumers in. In some parts of the business, such as Special K, where you need a high level of choices to keep people excited, interested in eating Special K each day, there is a wider level of varieties out there than you might have in some other brands. Also Jason, when we talk about innovation we're not just talking about another line extension. We are talking about beverages. We're talking about hot cereals. We're talking about breakfast sandwiches. So I think if you compared our innovation pipeline this year to, say, last year or the year before, there's a greater proportion of incrementality within the innovation pipeline. Plus, when you look at the international innovation, we are ramping up from a relatively low base and within that and some of the things that Paul talked about in Europe, that innovation is significantly more incremental than some of the historical cereal-based line extensions.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to come back with one more question, and it's really picking up where kind of growth relied into with your sustainable growth model, it worked for a number of years. It hasn't really proven to drive very sustainable growth recently. An important pillar of that is grow brand building, continue to increase the investment. Yet over the last 5 years, advertising up at a 1% CAGR, well below sales, down so far this year. So I guess back to Chris's question, why shouldn't we think that we need just a lot more reinvestment to really get this thing going, to get your back on the sustainable growth wheel?","John A. Bryant","Well, within that advertising line over the last 5 years, there has been a pretty significant shift under the surface between traditional 30-second advertising and digital and engaging consumers more effectively with different -- a different media mix. Having said that, I mean, we'll constantly look for fuel for growth in the organization. And say, how do we continue to drive effectiveness and efficiency to enable us to invest more in the business over time?","Operator","And the next question we have comes from Ken Goldman, JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You aren't the first company to experience some sluggishness in your legacy categories and brands. At the same time, you're integrating a new one, in this case, Pringles. As you look back on some of the challenges you faced in those legacy, cookies, crackers, cereals lately, would you have done anything differently, John, over the last year in terms of your time focused on legacy products and your whole management team's focus versus toward the integration? Or in your view, maybe those challenges facing those categories have taken place, whether Pringles was taken on or not?","John A. Bryant","Ken, it's a very difficult question to answer. Certainly, Pringles being the second largest acquisition in our history and being a carve-out bolt-on was more intense integration, particularly in some parts of the world, such as Europe. I don't think that some of the issues we've seen in cereal more recently were impacted by the Pringles acquisition. But certainly, it has been something that the organization has been focused on with the integration.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly, Latin America, almost all of your growth over the last few years has come from price mix, your volumes have been down. Can you talk a little bit about the breakdown between price and mix in that line and to what extent you're comfortable with volumes not really growing in a region where a lot of companies are seeing their tonnage up over the last few years?","John A. Bryant","Over time, as we go forward in Latin America, we are looking for more volume growth. I think when you look in the second quarter, it's a little distorted by lapping the trade inventory build that happened in Q2 last year that we spoke about on the second quarter call last year. The -- in particular, in Mexico, shipments are down quite significantly and now consumption was actually [indiscernible] I think if you're looking at a full basis, the volume performance will be much better. And certainly, our strategy going forward in Latin America is to be in volume growth.","Operator","The next question or last question that we have comes from Lucia von Reusner of Green Century Capital Management.","Lucia von Reusner","I'm just curious as a company publicly committed to sustainability, how will Kellogg ensure that the Kellogg brand is not associated with the illegal deforestation that it's partner, Wilmar, has been accused of? How will you ensure that the Kellogg brand remains sustainable and all that?","John A. Bryant","Well the Kellogg Company has a very strong track record on sustainability and we have a sustainability report that I would turn your attention to. In terms of palm oil, we actually buy green certificates to cargo all our palm oil purchases, and we feel very good about our practices in that area. We work with a number of partners and suppliers around the world, and I'll leave it to you to talk to Wilmar directly if you have any questions for them. But we feel very good about the Kellogg Company's position on this topic.","Simon Burton","Okay. Everyone, thanks very much for dialing in, and we'll be available throughout the rest of the day and tomorrow for questions. Thank you.","Operator","And we thank you, sir, and to the rest of the management team for your time today. The conference call is now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

And good morning and thank you for joining us today for review of our third quarter 2019 results and update of our full year 2019 outlook. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer.","Slide #3 shows our usual forward-looking statements disclaimer.

The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days.","As always, when referring to our results and our outlook unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on a currency neutral basis for net sales and on a currency neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.","And now I will turn it over to Steve.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, John and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of good progress with solid organic net sales growth and sequential improvement in profitability. In fact, returning to operating profit growth excluding our recent divestiture. We continue to do exactly what we said we do. In other words, we remained on strategy and it\u2019s another quarter in which we delivered the results we said we would, in short we remained on plan.","Let\u2019s start with strategy on slide #5. Our reshape portfolio is doing what is intended to do. We once again delivered good growth in emerging markets where we built up scale and diversified our offerings. We once grew and developed market snacks, thanks to revitalized brands, effective innovation and On the Go pack formats and we delivered growth in developed markets frozen foods led by innovation and marketing that has driven a particularly exciting acceleration for MorningStar Farms veggie foods.","This portfolio should give you confidence and our ability to sustain steady topline growth even as we work to stabilize developed market cereal particularly in the United States. As a reminder, as divestiture closed during the quarter, we\u2019re addressing stranded costs and the transition services are underway and being well executed. We used the proceeds to reduce debt and enhance financial flexibility and we\u2019re already feeling the benefit of increased focus behind the rest of our U.S. categories.","And from a portfolio standpoint, we\u2019re starting to see the divestitures favorable benefit of improved growth profile and better margins overtime. Beyond our portfolio reshaping, deploy for growth also continues to help us improve our competitiveness. Our focus on winning occasions is reflected in the strong performance of this year\u2019s innovations and sustained growth in On the Go offerings.","Our focus on building world-class brand in [Indiscernible] and everywhere from Pringles global momentum to the share gains of our revitalized U.S. snack brands to MorningStar Farms growth reacceleration. We\u2019ve also made progress on improving service and in-store execution aided not only by investment and capabilities, but also by the improved visibility and holistic resource management that comes from our efforts earlier this year to flatten our organizational structure. And our heart and soul boosters are also generating results, as evidenced by our recent rise in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ranking released during this quarter.","And the best proof that our strategy is working is in our results. In Q3, we again remained solidly on plan for the year. We said we would return to topline growth this year and we\u2019re delivering it.","Slide #6 shows that we sustained our accelerations in organic net sales growth. We again posted organic growth in all four regions and we again recorded positive price realization amidst higher cost inflation. Globally, we grew organic net sales in snacks, frozen and noodles and we grew cereal outside of North America led by emerging markets. Importantly, we again showed growth in consumption and share in key categories and brands around the world.","As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance. We said the profit growth would follow as we got past key investments and costs. During Q3, our operating profit excluding the mechanical impact of our divestiture moved into growth for the first time in several quarters. We delivered on promised sequential improvement in gross profit margin and we are seeing savings from the reorganizations we executed earlier this year. As a result, we're on target for our full year guidance for operating profit as well, even as we contemplate some incremental investments during Q4.","Over the past year, we've often said that the hardest thing to do is to restore topline growth and we're doing that. In fact the heaviest lifting and the biggest most disruptive actions are largely behind us. We can now work on restoring profitability as well as on more targeted areas of investment. Remember, we're building a foundation for consistent dependable steady growth overtime and Q3 was another quarter of evidence that the foundation is taking shape.","So with that let me now turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Amit?","Amit Banati","Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone. Our Q3 and year-to-date results are summarized on slide #8. Keep in mind that the results on this slide are affected by the divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses which closed at the end of July. So during Q3, there were two months of the quarter when we no longer had the sales and profit from those businesses.","Net sales were down year-on-year because of about four percentage points of this divestiture impact. But on an organic basis, our net sales were up more than 2% for a second consecutive quarter. Our year-to-date organic net sales growth is well within our full year guidance. Operating profit declined because of about 5 percentage points of divestiture impact suggesting or return to growth excluding it. This return to growth may be a little earlier than you were expecting though it did benefit from some favorable timing of certain investments and costs, which will come in quarter four. Our year-to-date currency neutral adjusted operating profit performance is in line with our full year guidance.","Earnings per share declined mainly because of the above mentioned divestiture impact on operating profit. However, partially offsetting this expected decline was a tax benefit. Our year-to-date currency neutral adjusted EPS is in line with our full year guidance.","Our cash flow was also affected by the divestiture. Remember, the transaction proceeds are not included in the cash flow, but the taxes on those proceeds are as our any upfront cost and working capital timing difference. Through the first nine months, our cash flow trailed last year because of the divestiture impact and timing. We are still on track for our full year guidance with taxes on the divestiture proceeds to offset underlying cash flow in quarter four. So our quarter three and nine month results remain clearly in line with our stated 2019 plan.","Let's now go into more details. As usual, we will start at the top of the P&L with net sales growth on slide #9. Our organic growth was up 2.4% and again we grew organically in all four regions. Among our categories globally, snacks led the growth increasing in all four regions. We also grew in frozen foods and we continue to expand in noodles. Cereal was down modestly due to our North America business, but it continued to grow outside of North America led by emerging markets. Importantly, consumption trends remain solid in key markets and categories around the world. And revenue growth management actions have helped us realize positive pricing even if modestly impacting volume. With 1.6% year-to-date growth an only one quarter left in the year we are obviously confident about achieving our full year guidance of 1% to 2% organic growth.","On the slide you can see the negative impact of our divestiture which closed one month into the quarter and had an impact of negative 4%. It will have a little more impact in quarter four, its first full quarter out of our results. For the full year, we still expect 2% to 3% negative impact on net sales from our divestiture to be offset by the positive acquisition impact of Multipro's consolidation which itself anniversaried early in quarter two.","Lastly, currency translation clipped more than a percentage point of our reported net sales in quarter three. While this pressure did moderate sequentially in part because of lapping last year's U.S. dollar appreciation, it has continued to run more negatively than we had expected.","Now let's turn to our gross profit margin on slide #10. As we have communicated previously, we expect a gross margin to decrease year-on-year in 2019, but for this decline to moderate as the year goes on. And once again, we saw marked sequential improvement in quarter three with a year-on-year decline in gross margin, the smallest it has been since back in 2017 before we exited DSD and reset our margins accordingly.","The chart shows the drivers of the sequential improvement in our gross margin. First, the mechanical bucket, the negative mechanical impact of consolidating Multipro, our distributor business in West Africa has anniversaried and starting in the third quarter, we began to see the positive mechanical benefit of divesting lower margin businesses during quarter three. We're also seeing the improvement in the bucket we call growth related. This bucket continues to feel negative pressure from mix, including mix shifts towards emerging markets and away from developed market cereal. It also reflects investments and costs into our food and packaging. Most notably our push into on the go pack format in North America snacks categories.","Revenue growth management is helping to mitigate some of this impact and over the course of quarter three we started to see some offsets from supply chain investments specifically we opened centralize packing centers over the course of quarter three and we are now starting up newly installed packing lines in certain plants to begin repatriating some co-packed volume.","We are also starting up local production of Pringles in Brazil for the first time. As we get ramped up, these actions will provide more and more benefit to gross margin and expect the overall growth related bucket will continue to improve in quarter four.","The final bucket is what we call ongoing. As we've discussed previously, we not only have higher input cost inflation in this yield, but we are also comparing against notably favorable hedges last yield especially in the first half.","Next, we continue to expect sequential improvement in gross profit margin in quarter four even if not quite as quickly as we would have liked. On SG&A expense, we continue to realize benefits related to organizational restructuring dating back to early this year and quarter three was the final quarter to lap the exceptional infusion of brand building investment that we made during quarter four 2017 through quarter three 2018.","Some of the investment that had been deferred to quarter three has now been moved to quarter four. The result of our good organic net sales growth moderating gross margin decline and year-on-year decrease in SG&A was a slight growth in operating profit before the impact of divestiture. We said profit will follow as we got past unusual investments and costs and it is.","Now let's move below the operating profit line turning to slide #11. As we have discussed previously these below the line items faced important headwinds in the first half moderating in the second half and you can see this in our quarter three results. Our interest expense in quarter three was flat for the first time this year. Remember, in the first half it was up year-on-year due debt added last year for our acquisition in West Africa and voluntary pension contributions.","Other income was also flat year-on-year for the first time this year, as favorability in items such as company owned life insurance offset a narrowing decline in net pension items. And for the first time this year, in quarter three we saw year-on-year favorability on our effective tax rate. Not only have we already lapped the sizable discrete benefits of first half 2018 as expected, but we also realized a benefit in this year's quarter three related to reversing a tax accrual. This is a one-time benefit that will not impact quarter four, but it does take down a full year tax rate estimates to around 20%.","Turning to slide #12, nothing has changed regarding our post divestiture timeline. As you know, the divestiture closed on July 29. So, from a financial perspective, the divestiture will have five months of dilution this year and seven months of dilution in 2020. As we now have greater visibility on transition services, plans around stranded costs and overall financial impact, we can now update you on timing of expected operating profit dilution. For this year 2019, we will likely track towards the favorable end of the guidance range we've previously given for impact on operating profit. Some of this dilution is shifting into 2020, when it may take a little longer to fully extract stranded costs depending on the length of transition services and when we lapse the seasonally largest operating profit of the divested business.","During quarter three, we redeemed debt incurring one-time premiums in interest expense but reducing our overall debt leverage. We still anticipate that this cost of redemption largely offsets the savings on interest expense this year. And again its worth mentioning that far more important than how this transaction impacts our 2019 P&L is, what it does for our overall growth and margin profiles going forward. Not only were these lower growth and lower margin businesses for us, but we can now focus more attention and resources on our best categories and brands. And we are already starting to experience this.","So let's move to our 2019 full your outlook and guidance, which is shown on slide #13. We are making no changes to our full year guidance for net sales, operating profits and cash flow and our earnings per share outlook moves to the favorable end of its guidance range. Currency neutral net sales are still expected to finish the year in the 1% to 2% range. In effect, the five months of divestiture in the second half offsets the four months Multipro acquisition in the first half. Meanwhile, organic net sales growth is still forecast to be 1% to 2% as well. Year-to-date, our organic net sales growth is 1.6% so we have confidence in this guidance range.","Currency neutral adjusted operating profit expectations continue to be in the negative 4% to 5% range as we have communicated since the divestiture. That's where we are running through the first nine months. We mentioned the expected divestiture impact shifting a little into 2020, but this is mostly offset in 2019 by investment that is shifting into quarter four. In addition, we may need to leave room for potential Brexit risk and\/or incremental investments. So we are maintaining our guidance range for operating profit. Currency neutral adjusted EPS is now expected to be at the favorable end of the previous guidance range of negative 10% to 11% given our quarter three tax benefit and favorability in other income.","And lastly, cash flow is still expected to finish the year at around $0.5 billion reflecting relatively stable based business cash flow year-on-year, but with a roughly $0.5 billion negative impact from the divestiture. Overall, our full year guidance for these metrics has not changed from the beginning of the year other than layering on the impact of our subsequent divestiture. And if anything over the course of the year we've reduced our reliance on quarter four. Meanwhile, we have paid down debt to enhance our financial flexibility. So we feel good about our financial position heading into the final quarter of the year.","I will now turn it back over to Steve, who will review each of our major businesses.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks Amit. Let's now turn to North America in slide #15. For a second straight quarter, we were able to grow organic net sales in this region in spite of a soft period for cereal. This speaks to the composition of our portfolio and the growth momentum we are seeing in our big snacks and frozen brands. It also speaks to the behind-the-scenes work we have been doing. We have changed our organizational design for better visibility and more holistic resource allocation. We have invested in capabilities such as revenue growth management and digital marketing. Our innovation launches and pipeline are the best we've had in years. Our performance in specialty channels remains very solid and we have overhauled key processes for better service and execution.","Meantime, we've been working to cover cost pressures. Revenue growth management has helped us realize price and we've taken major steps to restore margins on our rapidly expanding On the Go Pack formats. As a result margin declines in North America have continued to moderate sequentially. So in a year of incredible change in North America, there is a lot of great work going into its foundation for future growth.","Let's discuss each major category in a little more detail. We'll start with snacks, our largest category in North America on slide #16. Obviously, this is the business most affected by our divestiture. Nonetheless, it posted another quarter of strong organic net sales growth supported again by strong consumption. From a consumption standpoint, the categories in which we compete crackers, salty snacks and portable wholesome snacks collectively grew by more than 4% in Q3 and our consumption was up 5% gaining share. Behind the share gain was continued momentum by our biggest brands driven by effective brand building, incremental innovation and growth in occasion based pack formats.","Pringles continue to grow consumption led by On the Go expansion and effective in-store activity to go with its new wavy innovation platform. Cheez-It sustained its double-digit consumption growth with its successful Snap\u2019d innovation platform coming on top of double-digit growth in the core offering.","In portable wholesome snacks Rice Krispies Treats sustained its strong consumption growth with double-digit growth in both its core offerings and its new Popper's platform. Pop-Tarts consumption growth remains very strong bolstered by new bites and Nutrigrain has rebounded the consumption and share growth with its own bites offerings. So snacks had another very good quarter.","Let's turn now to cereal in slide #17. Candidly, cereal has taken a little longer than anticipated to bounce back after we pulled back investment in the first half to execute our pack size harmonization program. Our promotional activity as measured by the percentage of units sold on promotion in a scanner data didn't climb all the way back to year ago levels yet and we also delayed some advertising activity in part to enable us to activate additional capacity for certain products. Where we have most return to normal brand activity is in the taste fund segment which underwent its pack harmonization back in Q1. This quarter, our taste fund segments brands collectively grew consumption and share.","Greater consumer activation behind frosted flakes and its mission Tiger program resulted in shared growth for that key brand. We're seeing a good recovery in Honey Smacks with new reformulated foods and we're supporting better performance for brands like Froot Loops, Crave and new Pop-Tarts cereal. It is in a health and wellness in all family segments, which underwent pack harmonization in Q2 that we did not restore activity as quickly as we had planned in quarter three and we're also seeing the impact of eliminating certain underperforming SKUs. In recent weeks we are encouraged to see positive reaction to new advertising campaigns for both Special K and Mini Wheats. We've also reaccelerating growth in the bear naked granola brand and continue to grow cornflakes consumption and share. We expect gradual improvement in Q4 and into 2020. We are not where we need to be yet in North America cereal but we're on it.","And we'll finish our North American discussion with frozen foods on slide #18. We had another good quarter in frozen foods. Net sales lapped strong year ago growth and felt the impact of phasing out certain SKUs. More than offsetting these factors was accelerated growth in MorningStar Farms. MorningStar Farms are leading plant-based meat alternatives brand accelerated its consumption growth to 11% and gained more than a full share point. We're benefiting from some very creative social media, exciting new products and distribution growth at major retailers. So much has been made lately of the emerging ready to cook or refrigerated meat alternative segments and there is no question that this segment has terrific momentum in growth prospects. In fact, we are extremely excited about our new launch Incognito in Q1, 2020.","But, we are also excited about the momentum in prospects in the frozen aisle and not just in burgers but in all meat alternative types. One of our advantages is that we have a very complete portfolio. In Q3 for instance, MorningStar Farms grew consumption by 20% in poultry alternatives almost 6% in breakfast meat alternatives and more than 30% in hotdogs alternatives. We even grew 2% in frozen burger alternatives the segment that has seen the most competition from new refrigerated entries. And to further emphasize our various offerings, we are rolling out new packaging in December as shown on the slide.","In frozen breakfast, our net sales declined slightly because of tough comps and phasing out certain products. However, in our core frozen waffles, pancakes and French toast businesses, which we refer to internally as from the griddle, our overall consumption grew nearly 2% year-on-year. Eggo despite tough comparisons continued to grow consumption led by innovation in the French toast and pancake segments as well as sustained momentum for its premium thick and fluffy waffles sub line. Kashi has also accelerated its growth in this category as we pursue a natural and organic occasion. So we continue to feel very good about our frozen foods business.","Now let's discuss our international businesses starting with Europe on slide #19. Kellogg Europe has now posted eight straight quarters of organic net sales growth. The region's momentum continues to be led by Pringles whose double-digit growth benefited from outstanding commercial programs. These range from gaming oriented promotions to our Asia-inspired rice infused innovation. Growth is also being driven by increased On the Go Pack format offerings and by continued distribution expansion most notably in Russia. Cereal sales continued to stabilize in Q3. Across total Europe, the cereal category remains in modest growth and we've returned to share gains over the past few months.","This has been led by the U.K. where we benefited from effective brand building around brands like Crunchy Nut and the success of innovations like white chocolate Choco Pops. We also continue to grow strongly in Russia aligned to our emerging markets strategy. Wholesome snacks continue to be on a path to stabilization with particularly good performance in the U.K. this quarter led by Rice Krispie Squares. Europe's profit decline in the quarter was related to the timing of costs and promotional investments. So it was another very solid quarter for Europe.","Let's turn to Latin America, which posted another quarter of net sales growth as shown on slide #20. Keep in mind that there is a small divestiture impact on this region as we did offer most of the now divested brands in Puerto Rico. On an organic basis Kellogg Latin America posted net sales growth of nearly 6% year-on-year in Q3 despite lapping a double-digit gain in the year earlier quarter.","In Mexico, we continue to post good topline growth momentum led by continued consumption growth in cereal and lapping year ago acceleration. Additionally, we grew consumption and share in wholesome snacks and posted double-digit consumption growth in Pringles. We also grew [America snack] despite continuing to have to work through challenging macroeconomic conditions in Argentina and cereal and biscuit category softness in Brazil. We continue to perform well in the marketplace and we continue to realize price.","We also continue to build a future for Pringles in Brazil starting up local production for the first time and ramping up distribution through a new distributor. This created some extra cost in the quarter but it will make us that much more competitive going forward. Latin America's operating profit was pressured by these startup costs as well as higher input cost and adverse transactional foreign exchange but also by lapping a notably strong profit growth in the year ago quarter. So despite a challenging environment, we continue to feel good about our business in Latin America.","Finally, our Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa business is shown on slide #21. AMEA remained our fastest growing region in Q3 with net sales growth of nearly 8% year-on-year. The chart on the slide is intended to show you the relative sizes of our three major category groups. And as you can see, we grew in all three in the quarter just as we have year-to-date. In cereal, growth was led by Asia and the Middle East North Africa and Turkey sub-regions. Noodles and other is concentrated in Africa where we continue to grow strongly. Multipro's growth is driven not only by noodles, but also growth in other products it distributes in West Africa. In addition, we continue to expand distribution for Kellogg's branded noodles elsewhere in the continent.","In snacks, growth continued as Pringles maintained its momentum continuing to show strong consumption and share growth across the region with gains in markets ranging from Australia and South Korea to Saudi Arabia and India. Operating profit in the quarter was aided by the reversal of an accrual related to an excise tax matter that has been settled. Yet even without that we are delivering double-digit growth this year. So AMEA continues to be a very exciting region for us.","Let's wrap up with a brief summary on slide #23. We're doing what we said we would do. We're taking bold, decisive actions for the long-term health of the business. We've returned to topline growth and we're now focusing and addressing our profit margins. We told you that 2018 and 2019 would be an investor grow period for us as we implemented changes and invested behind our brands and capabilities under our deploy for growth strategy. Through Q3 we clearly remain on strategy.","We have continued to shape our portfolio toward growth closing on an important divestiture and continuing to build emerging market scale. We have continued to enhance our competitiveness through targeting new occasions, revitalizing world-class brands and improving service and in-store execution. We've continued to build capabilities notably in revenue growth management, innovation, digital media and e-commerce and we've realigned our organization for greater agility and yet through all of this change we've remained on plan.","Organic net sales growth is on track for full year guidance and our best performance in many years. Operating profit is on track for full year guidance with margins continuing to gradually comeback. Earnings per share are toward the favorable end of our guidance range and cash flow is on track for full year guidance. As always, I'd really like to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work and bringing about all of this change while still delivering on our financial commitments. Our people truly are our competitive advantage.","And with that operator, we will now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Good morning, folks. Thank you slot me in. I guess, my first question is on cereal as you mentioned in your slides this was the year to see some gradual improvement and we haven't seen it. We've kind of seen erosion instead. As you think about the forward, can you give us more context in terms of the activation plans you have to improve your market share performance and the reported organic sales are surprisingly softer than what we are seeing Nielsen on a fairly consistent basis. Is this a result of maybe you\u2019re under shipping consumption due to inventory drawdown of the trade, or is there weakness in all major channels that were not seeing and scanned?","Steve Cahillane","Yes, morning Jason. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. Clearly and I hope I articulated this well. Cereal in the United States is job number one in terms of what we have not delivered relative to our performance across the board and so it's obviously a priority. We underwent as you know, a huge pack harmonization in Q1 and Q2 and even it the Q3. And as I said, we are seeing some return to better performance in our taste and fun for you segment and you can see that in the Nielsen, a better performance not where we want to be but modest share gains where we have not yet seen is in special K and frosted Mini Wheats in particular, which underwent a later pack harmonization. And so there is a couple of reasons for that. One reason is, the delay of investment around frosted Mini Wheats more into the fourth quarter based on coming out of the pack harmonization a little late and not really having the capacity necessary. So that's one.","And number two is, just really making sure that we get the pack harmonization through before we reinvest in the category. So we are not where we want to be, but we are getting more green suits showing and if you look at even the latest four weeks outlook, four weeks is not a trend. But the latest Nielsen IRI data that's been published shows some of the best performance in the year across the broad cereal portfolio actually gaining share through the October 19, report. So we are seeing some modest improvements more than modest compared to where we have been based on the activities in the marketplace. So we are optimistic that we have the right plan as we go into Q4 and into 2020.","The other part of your question around timing shipments and so forth, a lot of that has to do with obviously promotional changes and the pack size harmonization and as we always say, there is always going to be a difference between timing of shipments and consumption. We will always prefer to be obviously on driving consumption and having consumption ahead, overtime retailers and suppliers are only going to get more efficient. It's in everybody's best interest always improve against inventory, bringing inventory down modestly that works for everybody in terms of working capital, in terms of freshness of product, in terms of just overall efficiencies in the supply chain. So I don't think we are seeing anything more than that. But we are pleased that consumption is ahead relative to shipment at this point. But we don't see any over arching theme there.","Jason English","That's helpful. One more question then I will pass it on. I think it was it was Amit, who mentioned in prepared remarks that with the topline now back to what you guys do a sustainable growth focus is now shifting on restoring profitability. I was hoping you could delve in a little bit more on the drivers of that. Clearly, we have seen gross margin erosion but from an absolute perspective your gross margins are still reasonably at healthy levels. It's the overhead party or P&L that looks heavy in context to most your other peers. Is there a structural reason why you think, your overhead should be so high or is that an area that in focus as you think about that restoration of profitability?","Steve Cahillane","Yes Jason, I'll start and then turn it over to Amit. Just an important to note, from a gross margin perspective we're not where we want to be we want to continue to drive that. We're very pleased that we're seeing sequential improvement based on the activities that we put in place. From an overall overhead standpoint, we've seen good improvements in terms of bringing the overheads down. When you look at our portfolio relative to others, we don't have a lot -- we don't really have any commodity type of businesses that don't require brand building. So some of our peers do have those types of commodity businesses in their base, which again would change the comparative, but overall I'd say we're driving towards better margin performance. We're pleased to see the sequential, but we know we still have work to do. Amit you want to.","Amit Banati","No, I think you covered it Steve. I think the only couple of other points I would make is we were pleased with the progress that we are making in gross margin both sequentially year versus year ago but also quarter-on-quarter. So I think if you look at our quarter three absolute gross margin, its grown 110 basis points versus where we were in the previous quarter and obviously that's going to be a focus area going forward. I think the only other thing I'd say on overheads is, scale in emerging markets as we continue to build scale in emerging markets that will certainly help us from a scale and overhead standpoint in those markets.","Jason English","Thank you guys. I'll pass on.","Operator","Next we have Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning everyone.","Steve Cahillane","Good morning Ken.","Ken Zaslow","One of the comments that you said starting through the introductory comments was that you're flattening out organizational structure. Can you talk about what exactly have you done and can you give some anecdotes of how that's actually either change the way you operate or have done something strategically to kind of give it a directional change of how that's actually impacting the outlook?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks for the question Ken. The big organizational changes we've made have been in North America and in Europe and if you think back to the past we had different business units really fully staffed business units focused on snacks, focused on morning foods, focused on frozen across different categories and what we've done is, we've combined it into one portfolio, one Kellogg portfolio which allows for much better resource allocation across. You don't have frozen competing with snacks competing with morning foods for investment. You have ahead of categories who is looking across the totality of the portfolio to say where am I getting the best return on investments, what are some of the most strategic areas for us to invest in and driving better decision making because of that as well as a lighter more nimble organization.","You also have a sales organization that is much easier to understand from a customer perspective. So you don't have somebody coming in selling snacks followed by another person coming in selling morning foods. You have somebody representing the totality of Kellogg both at the headquarter level and at the store level, which is not only more efficient but also more effective. So it's really in that sweet spot of being efficiency and effectiveness together and by and large that's the same focus that we brought to Europe as well. So it's about driving better resource allocation, better investment decisions, faster more nimble decision-making and we're seeing it happening in the marketplace and we're seeing that come through and better decision-making, faster decision making some of the best innovation we brought to bear in the marketplace this year I think is a direct output of some of the changes that we've made.","Ken Zaslow","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we have Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. One of the things I just wanted the clarification on in the prepared remarks is, I think you said the impact of the divestiture would be less severe in 2019 than you thought. But then it would shift into 2020. Amit, can you help us understand like why that timing is happening and then again if it's a little better than you thought what are you doing with that upside? You said you're reinvesting it for Brexit and maybe for other reinvestment spending. Is that correct?","Amit Banati","Yes. So let me just start with the divestiture impact. So I think as we've got greater visibility on the transition services as we've kind of firmed up our plants around stranded costs, I think we've got just a little more clarity around the phasing of how this will play out. So it's not a significant shift. I think, we had guided to -4 to -5. I think we're now saying that given the visibility that we now have three months into the process we're saying it's probably going to be -4 and I think that 1% we are saying would probably shift into next year. I think the shift into next year is again really driven by transitions services that we expect now to be longer than what we had initially thought. So that's going to drag into 2020.","And then related to that would be when you can extract the stranded cost because the two are obviously linked. And so, I think it's really that timing and that clarity and visibility on the timing that's caused the shift between the two years. And I think, in terms of investments again given this is not a major shift, I think as we head into quarter four a little bit of shift in investments from quarter three into quarter four is what we're looking at.","Robert Moskow","And then one follow-up. Was SG&A down excluding the divestiture in the quarter because I think you described it as an investment quarter, but it's kind of hard to tease that out with the divestiture?","Amit Banati","Yes. So SG&A was down and I think, like I mentioned in my prepared comments, it was a couple of things. One is the benefits that we are getting from the organizational restructuring dating back to the start of the year. So that was one driver and then the second driver was we were lapping the exceptional double-digit increase in brand-building that we had in quarter three 2018.","Robert Moskow","Thank you.","Amit Banati","Thanks.","Operator","Next we have Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. Two for me. First Steve, I think you mentioned eliminating some underperforming SKUs in cereal. There's been some I guess industry chatter about the impact of Click and Collect and delivery on grocery shelf sets and by that I mean some retailers have been leaning toward giving facings or bigger facings to the high velocity items or moving facings from lower velocity items at a sort of accelerated rate. I just wanted to know and poke around a little bit is your SKU rate have in any way related to that trend or is this more normal course of business and I don't want to make too big a deal out of that?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks for the question. It's not related to that. So it's the normal course of flavors that underperforming being replaced by new innovations, we haven't seen literally any real change in total points of distribution. So I would say just normal course of business. Obviously, the price package harmonization which was not normal course of business but in terms of SKU rate more normal.","Ken Goldman","Yes. Perfect. Thank you and then I guess my follow-up is, I know you're not ready to really talk about 2020 in any detail, but there were a couple comments made today that I wanted to make sure I heard correctly. So sounds like the TSA will last a little bit longer than you thought. It sounds like stranded costs will still be a headwind for next year as expected but you did caution a little bit about Brexit and maybe some more investments too. Are you trying to send a signal to investors that hey there's some really good things happening into next year in terms of sales and margins on the core level, but there's some other things that maybe might hold back at least temporarily some of the growth on the bottom line. Is that sort of a message that we're trying to take away from here or is that I'm again reading into that a little bit too much? ","Steve Cahillane","Yes, I\u2019d say don't read too much into it Ken. I think, let's start with Brexit, I mean clearly, everyday there's new news in the marketplace and it's hard to determine exactly what if anything will happen. So we've been cautious in terms of that. We don't know any better than anybody else exactly what may or may not happen. In terms of investment opportunities, we're saying we're on strategy, we're on plan. We're very pleased with where we're seeing the portfolio shape up outside of U.S. cereal. If we have the flexibility, give us the flexibility to make some investments in quarter four, we'll strive to do that to put us in the best possible position to continue to drive the momentum that we have in the topline. And so just very much on plan and if we have an opportunity to again continue to invest for the long term then we'll look to do that but I wouldn't read much more than that into it.","Ken Goldman","Thanks so much.","Operator","And next we have Steve Strycula of UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning. Two strategy questions. The first would be on revenue management. Steve as you look across the portfolio, how do you think about which categories in which regions have the most runway, we hear more and more companies talking about that being an increasingly important lever to drive price mix especially as a commodity that kind of flattens out and then I have a follow-up?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. I wouldn't say really that revenue growth management by category has more opportunities in one category or another category. We're obviously focused on our big categories and our big geographies. And so, you think about cereal, you think about snacks, you think about frozen in North America and driving RGM activity and progress there. You think about snacks and cereal in Europe being another big area and focused on developed markets first before we think about emerging markets. Emerging markets were obviously very-very laser focused on our strategy of the affordability pyramid and thinking about making sure we have locally relevant foods that are affordable for the local populations is the way we think about kind of the broader RGM strategy there and then develop markets more sophisticated modern trade approach to it.","We're pleased with the progress we're making. We're striving towards always driving a better balance between volume and price mix. We're pleased with the type of price mix we've been able to drive this year particularly relative to the last several years, but we're working towards really driving a better balance and always having a volume component as well as a price mixed component that's in the black.","Steve Strycula","Steve to follow up there how do we think about that particularly North America price mix volume balance transition as we think over the next few quarters. And then, on the snacking piece you've done a very nice job there. How do we think about as you look for inorganic opportunities to build it out further? What are your top priorities? Is it doubling down on the U.S. market? Is it looking to new emerging markets where you don't have a footprint or actually building out more of a bulkhead in some of your emerging markets where you have like a half position of footprint? Thank you.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. So I'd say, in terms of the developed markets it's balanced as I said, trying to find the right balance and seeking the right balance between volume and price mix is always important for the long-term and so that's what we seek to do there. In terms of inorganic nothing's really change from what we said, if we find the opportunity to find a great business in a white space in snacking in better-for-you and develop markets that could be interesting, scale in emerging markets is very interesting for us. We're very pleased with the investments we've made in Parati, in Multipro, in [Dufo] and so those are a good kind of template to think about the way we think about opportunities inorganically for us. Beyond that obviously I wouldn't want to single anymore.","Steve Strycula","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Nik Modi of RBC.","Nik Modi","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two quick ones for me. Amit, maybe you can just talk about the commodity cost environment from Kellogg\u2019s point of view? I'm talking about obviously recent drought conditions in Australia leading Kellogg\u2019s take a price increase here. So anything on the horizon that we should be thinking about? And then, for you just thinking about the European business for cereal and how it's really started to progress nicely and move into the almost positive territory, any learnings from that market that you can apply or you think are relevant from the U.S. market? Thanks.","Amit Banati","So maybe I'll just start with your question on some commodities. Obviously, we're not getting into 2020 guidance on this call but if you kind of look at where current input prices are and spot rates, we should be looking at little less inflation or in the next year compared to 2019. 2019 as you know, we saw mid-single digit inflation year-on-year, so compared to that we should probably be seeing lesser inflation as we look at 2020 based on where spot markets are.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Nik in terms of Europe as a bellwether and an area to learn from it clearly is that the European cereal business from a category standpoint is returned to growth and we're growing faster than the category especially in quarter three in the U.K. where we saw some very nice acceleration led by Crunchy Nut and Choco Pops and the learnings there are definitely applicable. White chocolate Choco Pops was a huge hit. They've also got some commercial programs and innovations that have been very successful that the U.S. team is studying for relevance in the United States.","Special K actually showing good improvement in Europe and in the United Kingdom really focused on the food. Food being the hero and some of that learning is being applied and as I said even if you look at Special K in the most recent data available some of the stuff that we've brought over from the U.K. and the learnings and the focus on food is giving us reasons for cautious optimism.","So, I think broadly speaking the fact that Europe is in the type of growth it is in cereal is an inspiration for us and there is definitely some learning that can be applied to the U.S. but we've got work to do in the U.S. in terms of cereal. We know that. We're on it and when we get that to where we know we can get it I think the rest of the portfolio really shines through.","Nik Modi","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next we have Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you.","Steve Cahillane","Good morning Michael.","Michael Lavery","Can you give a little bit more color on your implied 4Q outlook? You've said things have been on planned so far. You're obviously holding guidance, but it looks like that would likely imply a sequential deceleration in organic EBIT growth maybe down a point or two. You mentioned some of the spending shifts. Can you touch on maybe the magnitude of that and you mentioned Brexit as a risk. It looks like that could slide to next year. What are your assumptions baked in for 4Q as it is and maybe the last piece is just as you talked about some of the centralized packing for the On the Go packs in 3Q, how much was that ramping and should we expect more of a benefit in 4Q? Can just help us put all that together?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. I'll start Michael and maybe Amit will add as well. Obviously, we don't give quarterly guidance and we reaffirmed everything we talked about for a full year and so you can obviously do the math from there. In terms of Brexit obviously, we don't know what if anything that will bring and when it will bring. We're preparing as best we possibly can but there's an array of different potential outcomes there and what we like everybody else are watching. In terms of our On the Go pack formats and bringing things in-house we're making good progress there and that's one of the drivers behind our sequential gross margin expansion. So we'll continue to do that.","And then, beyond that I wouldn't signal anything about next year. Again it's too early to talk about 2020 guidance and we like where we are in terms of on strategy, on plan. We're looking to do the same type of drive the same type of performance in Q4 and when we talk about Q4 results in February, we'll give you a better outlook on exactly the way we're thinking about 2020.","Amit Banati","I think the only other thing I'd add is just the divestiture impact. So in quarter three we had two months of impact. In quarter four will have the full quarter of impact. So in quarter three NSV or the divestiture impact was about 4 percentage points on NSV and about five percentage points on OP. Given we've got three months in quarter four, it'll be around 5% on NSV and an OP it will be around 8% to 9%. So I think that the impact of the divestiture will be more pronounced as we have three months of that in quarter four. And I think as Steve mentioned earlier, we'd also look to see if we could make some investments behind growth opportunities should we have the opportunity to do so.","Michael Lavery","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Next we have Laurent Grande of Guggenheim.","Laurent Grande","Yes. Good morning everyone. Two questions actually. The first one is, I mean still on the guidance I mean you have stronger margin in the quarter and delivering a bit on EPS. In addition you lowered your tax rate guidance for the year and despite all those positive you just had modestly your EPS guidance for the year. So could you please help us reconcile and as it may prove, your guidance is a bit conservative. And second question is really more on the North American frozen food and MorningStar Farm specifically. Lots of interest recently on prom based burger meat alternative generally. Could you please let us know are you are planning to compete against rather new entrants like impossible or beyond in the category? Leverage your scale especially in the art of home consumption.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks Lauren. I wouldn't, I'd just be repeating in terms of quarter four guidance. We're pleased about where we are on strategy, on plan. You look at where our sales is and we want to continue to maintain that type of momentum which gets us exactly in the 1% to 2% as we guided towards. And as both Amit and I mentioned if we have an opportunity to invest in quarter four we would be looking to do that and so that's kind of where we stand in terms of the full year outlook.","In terms of the frozen business and in particular our MorningStar Farms business, we believe we have a competitive advantage for several reasons. Number one, we've got a very complete portfolio. We've got frozen. We're going to introduce refrigerated in the first quarter of 2020 and we even have an ambient offering in our [Indiscernible] that were in test right now that we're optimistic about the potential there. So a full-on complete portfolio we have the scale that is Kellogg from a manufacturing standpoint, from a sales standpoint, from an R&D standpoint. I've been trying our food on a very regular basis that we're going to introduce in the first quarter and I am very pleased with the food and very proud of our R&D team that have really created a best-in-class, a refrigerated offering that we're very excited to be launching.","We've had a number of customers trying that as well and so as I look at the totality of what we bring MorningStar Farms, the brand, the heritage the tradition, the insights that we have, the complete portfolio that we have, the poultry offerings which continue to do extremely well, I think we've got a real gem in our portfolio and you'll see more of that come through and I guess I would just end with the fact that even without the refrigerated offering being in the market yet you're seeing a real acceleration as we talked about in our veg business MorningStar consumption was up nearly 11% in quarter three, gaining 120 basis points a share. So we're very pleased with the team and what they've accomplished and believe that the best days for that business are clearly in front of us.","Steve Cahillane","Operator we are at 10:30, so we're going to have to wrap it up. But thanks everyone for your interest and please call if you have any other questions.","Operator","And we thank you sir, to the rest of the management team for your time also this morning. Again the conference call is now concluded. At this time you may disconnect your lines. Thank you. Again everyone take care and have a wonderful day."]}}
