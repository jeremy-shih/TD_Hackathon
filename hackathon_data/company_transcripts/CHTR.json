At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Charter's First Quarter 2016 Investors Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Stefan Anninger; you may begin your conference.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome to Charter's First Quarter 2016 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent proxy statement and Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call; however, we encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified. Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. For some time now, we've been working to combine Charter-Time Warner Cable and Bright House. While I'm very pleased with our progress towards closing and integration, I'm just as pleased with Charter's core operating performance. Our products, service, customer growth and financial results continued to improve as we deliver more value to our residential and business customers than ever before.","Our operating and financial results show the potential growth trajectory and our new operating strategies will drive on a larger set of assets following the close of our transactions and the positive impact that we can have on those communities that will ultimately be served by Charter.","At the end of the first quarter, Charter had 6.8 million residential and SMB customers. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our total customer base by 6%, with residential customer growth of 5% and small business customer growth of 18%. We continued to grow our video customer base in the first quarter. Total video customers grew by 15,000, including 10,000 residential video, net adds and our all-digital video product enables HD and on-demand on every outlet.","And we fully deployed our TV app for both mobile devices and media players for content delivery both in and out of home. We recently launched our cloud-based UI in St. Louis in addition to Reno. It continues to scale well and is resonating with consumers. We also continued to grow our Internet business. Residential Internet customers grew by 9% over the last 12 months.","During the first quarter, we added 141,000 residential Internet customers. The strong demand that we're seeing for our Internet service is being driven by offering minimum 60-megabit speeds, quality service and consumer-friendly features, including unlimited data usage and no modem fees. Including voice, we added 186,000 PSUs in the first quarter, over 20% more than the 154,000 we added in the first quarter of 2015.","We also continue to see improving commercial customer net additions, with SMB PSU growth accelerating by 68% year-over-year in the first quarter. That customer growth improvement is being driven by the launch of new small business pricing and packaging in the first quarter of last year. We also launched new pricing and packaging for enterprise in the fourth quarter, including a deeper gigabit service offering that's driving a significant increase in sales.","During the quarter, we grew our total revenue by 7.1%, with even less reliance on rate increases. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year, whether you include transition expenses or not. So EBITDA growth continues to exceed our revenue growth as it has for several quarters now as we take operating transactions out of the business through investing in our network, systems and people.","We have a fully integrated operating strategy and business model which is based on a clear, centralized organizational structure, creating a superior product set, packaged at highly competitive prices to sell more product, unleashing the full capacity of our two-way interactive network by going all-digital, insourcing service operations, people, cloud-based services and product platforms and continuous product development to stay ahead. As a result, the higher level of growth at Charter can be sustainable for a long period of time.","It's also an indication of what we believe we can do at Time Warner Cable and Bright House. That will require time and investment just as it did at Charter, but I believe it can happen faster because of the relatively better starting condition of the assets we're acquiring.","And we'll also benefit from transaction synergies to help offset the investments to achieve those operating synergies. I also believe our approach and track record here at Charter over the last several years will make the trends at New Charter easier for investors to understand over the next several years. So our customer growth and financial performance is very good as we had planned. Our sales were up and our residential churn is down. And in the first quarter, we saw a 15% year-over-year reduction in billing and service calls as well as a 19% reduction in service truck roll volume. Our field service truck rolls are now 80% insources versus 50% in 2012 and it's increasing. And call center activity is now 90% insourced. In total, since the beginning of 2012, we've increased our workforce by over 7,000 people, with the vast majority of the increase driven by insourcing.","With our all-digital transition complete and secure two-way boxes installed on every residential outlet, in April, we began to perform electronic disconnects instead of physical truck rolls. This change in practice also allows us to fully scale our self-install practices beyond what we did during all-digital. Electronic disconnects and self-installs will provide significant benefits to Charter Systems in the coming years. It will also reduce operating costs and capital expenditures and raise customer satisfaction through greater control over the installation process and will also reduce the opportunity for service failure in a way that provides even better security.","Turning to the closing process with TWC and Bright House, on April 12, the administrative law judge assigned by the California PUC to review our transactions recommended that our transactions be approved by the California Public Utility Commission. We expect the CPUC to vote on the judge's recommendation on May 12. All other states have approved our transactions.","We're also pleased that the FCC Chairman has circulated an order approving our transactions and that the DOJ has filed a proposed judgment with the district court under which our proposed transactions may proceed. Assuming we've received FCC approval, we would expect to officially close our transactions within just a few days of receiving approval from the California PUC.","Next several months and quarters will be an exciting time for New Charter. And after a lot of creative thought, we've decided to call the new company Charter. Our first priority is to get our people in the right roles and reporting structures with the right responsibilities. We've already announced Charter's organizational structure and leadership across the three organizations. Our corporate organization, as well as marketing, sales and product development departments, will be centralized over a period of six months following close. Our field operations group, which is the largest organization, will be managed through 11 different regional areas. Each of those regions has been designed to represent a logical combination of designated marketing areas. And these regions will be managed with largely the same set of field employees that are with the three companies today.","Following close, customer care will continue to be operated as it currently is at each of the three companies today. Over time, customer care will migrate to the Charter model of using virtualized U.S. based in-house call centers. This migration process is likely to take several years as it has here at Charter. A partial driver of the timing of our customer care transition is the pace at which our IT and network operations integrations progress. Our goals with these integrations will be to minimize service disruptions and to enable the business to deploy superior products and services.","Managing the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House will also be a key priority. At close, we will briefly pause any new digital rollouts at both companies and then restart them, deploying fully enabled two-way set-top boxes everywhere and discontinuing D2A deployments. Concurrent with all-digital, we'll introduce new product in pricing and packaging. We'll also launch our new pricing and packaging across those portions of TWC and BHM footprints that have already gone all-digital. We plan to complete all-digital and the launch of new pricing and packaging across all 36 million passings at TWC and Bright House by the end of 2018.","In historic Charter markets, we expect to make our new cloud-based user interface available in most markets by the end of 2016. We're still working through our Guide rollout plans for TWC and Bright House markets. That includes coordinating Guide rollouts with our market-by-market plans for all-digital and the launch of new pricing and packaging.","Ultimately, our goal is to offer our customers the significant Guide benefit as quickly as possible, but not at the cost of disruption to service operations or the customer. So, we'll have more to report on once we actually close and start running the businesses. Our plans are in place and we're ready to go to work, and we remain confident as ever about the benefits that our transaction will bring to our customers, employees and our shareholders.","I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work and dedication to getting us where we are so far and to our financial stakeholders, who have continued to support us.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Chris to take you through the financials.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. Starting with slide seven of today's presentation: during the first quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 186,000 versus 154,000 last year. And in video, we added 10,000 residential customers versus a loss of 13,000 last year. In residential Internet, we added 141,000 customers versus 125,000 last year. And we grew residential voice customers by 35,000 versus 42,000 last year.","Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 318,000, or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 1.4%, driven by a larger triple play base and step-ups and modest rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth.","As slide nine shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 6.5%; that compares to 6.7% last year as our faster customer growth offsets lower rate increases as designed. In commercial, we added 32,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 SMB PSUs in the prior year. That improvement follows the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups with new SMB pricing and packaging launched late last year.","Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% and continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in 2012. Our advertising revenue was up about 9% year-over-year, driven by a $5 million increase in political. In total, our first quarter revenue was up by 7.1% year-over-year and the same when excluding advertising.","Turning to first quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 10. Total operating expense grew by $85 million or 5.4% year-over-year, with transition OpEx accounting for $21 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming expense grew by $37 million, accounting for just under half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 5.5% increase in first quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers.","Excluding a one-time expense benefit and the growth in our video customer base year-over-year, programming expense would have grown by 6% flat versus the prior-year quarter.","Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, network operating costs declined slightly year-over-year, despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.9%. That ties directly to the operating metrics Tom highlighted and is both consistent and improving relative to what we've seen for several quarters.","Other costs grew by $34 million or about 18% year-over-year, driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, including the insourcing of IT and software development resources and advertising and enterprise costs, property taxes on previous CapEx and the higher casualty claims due to a more in-sourced employee base.","Excluding a one-time non-recurring expense, this other expense category would have grown by 13% year-over-year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year, whether you include transition costs or not and continued to exceed our revenue growth. As Tom mentioned, the continued growth of revenue per passing is an (16:52) operating improvement, is at an early stage for Charter Systems and has momentum.","Moving to slide 12, first quarter capital expenditures totaled $429 million, with $53 million related to M&A transaction spend. That spending began with the Comcast transactions and has provided us a head start to providing a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers beginning post-close. Excluding transition CapEx in both periods, our first quarter CapEx was up by just over $39 million or 12%, driven primarily by our investments in product development and the in-year timing of the fleet purchases which falls into the support capital line.","For 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and the pending acquisitions, we expect our CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline at Charter year-over-year.","First quarter free cash flow was negative $61 million and the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher cash interest on our transactions-related debt in escrow and from higher CapEx for the reasons I just outlined. If you exclude the impact of our transactions, specifically $21 million of operating expense, $53 million of CapEx, $259 million of cash interest in escrow and $14 million of transaction costs and other expenses, our free cash flow, adjusted for transaction spend, totaled approximately $280 million; that's up significantly versus last year on the same basis.","As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was 4.1 times. The $21.8 million of cash sitting in escrow for our transactions, plus Term Loan A commitments in our combined liquidity at close fully finances our transactions, assuming TWC shareholders elect the $100 cash option. At closing, we still expect to be levered at 4.5 times or less on an LTM basis and assuming the first 12 months run rate synergies of approximately $500 million.","In February, we issued $1.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and in April, we issued an additional $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We intend to use the proceeds from these offerings to redeem Charter's currently callable outstanding higher-priced debt although part of the proceeds from the February offer could be used to finance our transactions if some of the TWC shareholders were to elect to receive $115 per share in cash rather than $100.","Turning to the pending transactions, we expect the second quarter would be the first quarter for which we will report our results following close and I wanted to give you a brief preview on how we expect to report and to mention a few things to better navigate our second quarter results. With an anticipated mid-quarter closing, our second quarter results will reflect a full quarter for legacy Charter, plus stump (18:01) periods for TWC and Bright House. So year-over-year, our actual comparisons will really be helpful, but we will provide historical performance for the three companies under the historical management. We intend to present Charter's quarterly trending schedule with pro forma data along the lines of what you receive today dating back to the beginning of 2014.","Going forward, we'll report similar customer, PSU and revenue data for Charter's three legacy entities for at least five quarters following close, both separately and of course on a consolidated basis. This approach is going to allow you to track the development of each of the three legacy entities.","We'll not show expenses or capital expenditures by legacy entity. It's not really practical given the shared nature of large key items like programming, overhead and significant centralized capital spend. We'll also continue to report transition expense in capital related to the integration. And we'll provide updates or conference calls on certain items including estimates for the synergies we've realized so you can better isolate the organic growth of the business. We'd probably do that for about two years beginning in the first full quarter of results.","Our balance sheet and P&L will also be materially impacted by purchase price accounting and allocation. And part of that will be a significant fair market value step-up of TWC and Bright House assets, reflecting the fair market value of the consideration we provide as of the closing dates.","The step-ups will primarily be in PP&E, franchises, customer relationships and goodwill. However, none of the three companies' assets will be stepped up for tax purposes. As a result of the difference between the stepped up GAAP basis and the existing tax basis at TWC, there will be a significant increase to our deferred tax liability on our GAAP balance sheet.","On a pro forma basis and as already reflected in our S4 and other filings, the GAAP basis step-up will also increase Charter's GAAP D&A charges above what the simple addition of historical D&A would be for the three legacy entities.","Purchase price accounting will also likely result in the posting of an opening liability on the balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the outer (21:53) market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. There would be no change to the TWC cash payments as a result of that accounting, but future P&L expense would be lower as a result.","We'll also modify the value of TWC's legacy debt to its fair market value at closing and the difference between the fair value at closing and the actual principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving a difference between GAAP and cash interest expense.","So, those are some of the largest key items that result from purchase accounting, but there are a number of other key post-closing items that I'll mention that will impact the consolidated financials. Our share count, which stands at approximately 112 million shares outstanding today will increase at close as we issue shares to TWC shareholders and to Liberty Broadband.","Given that Advance\/Newhouse Partnership units are exchangeable at any time, it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value and any Charter share-based metrics.","Also keep in mind that as part of the transactions, Charter will undergo what we refer to and explain in more detail in our S4 as the Parent Merger Exchange. This transaction will essentially haircut the number of shares outstanding for the entire company for all shareholders including Advance\/Newhouse Partnership units by approximately 10%.","The Parent Merger Exchange will be value-neutral on all parties' aggregate holdings in Charter, but it will reduce the overall share count of the company, both on a shares outstanding basis and on an as-exchanged basis, again by about 10%. In theory, New Charter's stock market price should reflect this reduction in shares with the commencement of share price increase on the day New Charter's stock begins to trade on the NASDAQ.","Slide 22 in the appendix of today's investor presentation should provide investors with a better understanding of Charter's share count and how the shares outstanding change for the Parent Merger Exchange and the Advance\/Newhouse units on an as-exchanged basis.","Moving on to some more post-closing, accounting and reporting housekeeping. At close, TWC employees who currently hold TWC stock awards will see those stock awards replaced with New Charter stock awards which will mirror their current economics. The post-closing vesting of these awards will increase stock compensation expense post-closing to reflect the updated fair value of these replacement stock awards as compared to their original grant value.","I should also mention that after closing, substantially all of the $3 billion valuation allowance which is posted against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets is expected to be removed as the use of our NOLs will now be accelerated in Charter's consolidated tax return.","The legacy Charter deferred tax asset account on the balance sheet today and net income in that quarter will both increase by approximately $3 billion as a one-time benefit. We'll also expense a quarterly charge of approximately $38 million in preferred coupon for Advanced\/Newhouse's ownership of preferred partnership units. That charge will be reported on a separate line as non-controlling interest expense. We'll also have some transaction advisory expenses for both Charter and TWC, which are contingent and payable at closing, already disclosed in the S4 as well as the commitment and placement fees for our financing and we expect below-the-line restructuring and termination expenses through the integration process that will post below the EBITDA line as well.","Finally, turning to our tax assets, as we indicated on our last call, we don't expect Charter to be a significant cash taxpayer until 2018, and even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pre-tax income should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. And when I refer to GAAP pre-tax income, we are excluding the impact of the pending purchase price accounting that will have on GAAP depreciation and amortization expense going forward.","We do expect the transactions to trigger a change of ownership under Section 382 of the Tax Code. And while that change in ownership will again restrict the pace at which our NOLs will become available, I don't expect it to negatively impact the net present value of our tax assets similar to last time, as the transactions here will create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus standalone Charter today.","Operator, with that, we're ready for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now open.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tom or thanks. Question for Tom. Can we \u2013 we talked a little bit about the migration of the Time Warner Cable base to the new pricing and packaging. You mentioned it a little bit on the call, but over what time period do you expect it to take place and what kind of impact can we expect on the top line of the new assets? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it will take \u2013 it will take some time to roll out new pricing and packaging across Time Warner and Bright House. The plan is to, as I described, to continue the all-digital project that is going on currently at Time Warner and to initiate a similar project at Bright House in the Tampa area, and as we do that to roll out new pricing and packaging behind it. We also intend to launch, within a matter of four months or so, new pricing and packaging against the parts of the company that have already gone all-digital and to get it rolled out over the period of time it takes to do all-digital, which could take through the end of 2018.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","And through that period, do you expect any meaningful change on \u2013 that Time Warner Cable just posted a pretty solid top-line growth number, do you expect any impact on the growth rate of those assets?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, yes. We're going to have to integrate those assets into our packaging and pricing, and we're going to have costs associated with that. And we \u2013 our objective is to actually accelerate the growth rate. And in order to do that, we're going to spend more capital by going all-digital and putting two-way interactive boxes on every outlet, and we're going to package in such a way that we think we get longer-term revenue growth and get that revenue growth over a longer period of time with the quality of the products that we're selling into the market. So, they've done very well, which we're very pleased with. The assets are in better shape than we'd even planned for, which is a great relief. But we do have plans to spend money and spend capital in order to have a uniform product that we think creates a longer-term growth prospect that will produce consistent long-term growth rates.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good morning. Thank you very much. I guess I had one question in the context of CapEx. The JV that you have with ARRIS, can you talk about the full scope of the JV and the advantages it brings to Charter, I guess, both from an innovation standpoint and also how it impacts your ability to more efficiently deploy capital? And then I just had one another question, just on the synergies. Chris, based on what you were saying about timing, it sounds like you expect to fully realize the synergies on a run rate basis in about two years. Is that the right interpretation of what you had said? Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, let me start with the second one. No, that's not the right interpretation, although I'm glad you asked it because it should highlight for people. I was giving a commitment that we'll report that amount on a going-backwards basis of how much is realized inside the quarter for two years. It could end up being longer depending on where we're actually at. I think what we've said in the past is that we expect synergies could be \u2013 over the course of three years, could be fully baked into the actuals and that wasn't a change of where I think I could be. So, after two years, we'll evaluate where we are. But I wanted to give people some clarity about how we were going to report the business in the upcoming two years at a minimum.","On the ActiveVideo JV that we have with ARRIS, it's a productive relationship that we have both with the management team at ActiveVideo as well as ARRIS who owns 65%. We have a couple of board seats on that investment. We're treated as an independent third-party vendor inside the relationship with ActiveVideo. So, I guess the benefit would be the ability to see what the pipeline of product that they have coming in the future and to have oversight in terms of how that's being developed elsewhere. But we saw an attractive product that we were using, amongst other vendors in our Spectrum Guide platform, and we thought it was an interesting equity investment, but also of strategic importance to Charter.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And to further answer your question, that ActiveVideo technology platform allows us to use existing set-top boxes and put a state-of-the-art user interface on those already deployed boxes and not have to replace those boxes so that they essentially become state-of-the-art boxes. And that's the capital advantage of having that vendor relationship.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks to you both. Appreciate it.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bryan.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. A couple please. First on synergies, now that the deal is pretty much done, we've always thought that $800 million was kind of conservative. Is there a newer view on that? And is it fair to still assume that the programming step-downs on the Charter base will happen pretty much immediately on the deal closing? And then just on the all-digital plan, I think \u2013 I've estimated that there's about 13 million, 14 million DTAs and analog boxes within Time Warner Cable and Bright House, is that sort of the right base that we could see being transitioned to all-digital? Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Maybe I get the first two, we can tag team the third. On the $800 million, I think there was a general misconception right from the get-go as what we call synergies; $800 million was a three-year run rate of transaction synergies. What we don't include in that is the amount of operating synergies that come from taking a different philosophy towards pricing and packaging and insourcing service and lowering the amount of transactions. So, the transaction synergies, we're not getting an update on our thoughts around that other than to think that it was \u2013 other than to say that we always thought it was conservative; we still do.","But that's really tied to the elimination of duplicate overhead programming and other transaction-related synergies of just putting the companies together; it's not a change in the operating strategies which is how you get an additional profitability for passing over time. So, one can argue and say, well, the synergies are obviously much, much higher than the $800 million and I would agree with that; but that's really a change in the way that the businesses are operating as opposed to M&A transaction synergies, which is what the $800 million refers to. On programming timing, yes, we believe we'll step into the Time Warner Cable rate card in the appropriate places effectively at close. And on DTAs, I don't have the number in front of me.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure that that \u2013 I can't verify that your number is correct off the top of my head. So \u2013 but our plan will be to let them come out of the marketplace in a natural way and we're not going to go force them out. So as we transact business and move people into new pricing and packaging, we'll give the new customer base on the new pricing platform two-way boxes on every outlet. So, there will be DTAs in some of these markets for years to come.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great; thanks so much.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Morning. Tom, I don't know if you want to shed some light for us on the FCC's approach around the set-top box, NPRM and also the special access noise that's been going on lately given how much time you spent in DC over the last few months and year? If you could just tell us how you think those two may or may not impact the new company going forward.","And then Chris, cost to service was, I think, down in the quarter. I don't know if that's a clean number or if there were anything one-time in there. But I'd love if you could just talk about the operating leverage you're seeing in the existing Charter business since that's obviously an important lens for us to look at as we think about the new company down the road.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well. Ben, you're right. I've spent a lot of time there, but focused on other things. From Charter's point of view, we don't charge for modems and we try to keep our box prices low, relatively speaking. And we have made our applications available on other set-top boxes that consumers can purchase. And so, from a \u2013 if you just look at it as people being concerned about the price of boxes, we think that our operating practices fit with that goal.","The control of copyright and the control of privacy are real issues and we have strong views that they should be protected. With regard to special access, we haven't seen the full scope of that yet, only what's been publicized and we're a nascent player in that market with \u2013 the whole cable industry I think is less than 10% penetrated against that very large marketplace. And so it seems premature to me to be thinking about regulating a new entrant to a marketplace.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Makes sense.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the cost to service, no, there's not any one-time benefit that's sitting inside the number, that's real operating leverage, if you want to use that term. It is directly a result of lower service calls to the call centers and significantly lower service truck rolls out in the field. And so what that means is that your ability to have a larger number of customers with a higher amount of revenue and a lower underlying operating cost because you have fewer calls and truck rolls taking place, that continues to improve at Charter. And we've just made some additional changes that Tom mentioned in terms of stopping to do hard disconnects now that we have the plant secured (36:24).","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hard disconnects mean a truck trip to telephone pole and then a reconnect on every transaction. So, it's really your churn rate times two transactions.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, it's a significant reduction in cost going forward.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And that's not in the numbers as of yet.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. But I think the operating cost strategy that we have is something that we've been working on for a long time and I'm very proud that it's actually showing up now before we get a lot of confusing numbers going forward. We have been working on a pricing and packaging strategy that reduces activity all through the marketing process and the activation process of customers is designed to increase the life of subscriptions. So, for the same dollars of revenue, with longer customer life, meaning less churn, same dollars of revenue, you have less costs per customer because you have less physical activity per dollar of revenue. And though by maintaining our plant properly and by improving the quality of our craftsmanship by our employee base which we've been hiring and training, we reduced service calls. And that further improves customer satisfaction which improves subscriber life and all of those things are taking transaction costs out of the business. Even though our labor costs on a per-transaction basis are going up, our transaction reductions are exceeding that rate of increase in cost per transaction, and overall costs of running the business are going down. That's a very virtuous cycle.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. So, 5% customer growth with flat cost to service is actually how you guys sound like you can sustain for a bit, not necessarily those numbers, but at least directionally.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's our goal.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ben, you'll remember what it took to get there. So, it took a lot of quarters of higher investment both in CapEx and OpEx, patients on the revenue line to develop as you went after growth for the reasons that Tom talked about and to put in the right operating practices. So similar to what we had at Charter, as we go put that in place on a larger set of assets at Time Warner Cable and Bright House, those Charter shareholders have been around with us for a while, we'll recognize that and new shareholders will need to look back to what we did and how it developed to see the progress.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. First of all, Chris, thanks for giving us all the detail that you did today around future disclosure; that's hugely helpful. A quick question for both \u2013 I guess both Chris and Tom, looking ahead at both your assets and the assets that you're taking over, where do you think broadband and Pay TV penetration can ultimately get to? And then when we look at the difference in revenue per relationship between the Time Warner Cable properties and your properties, sort of leaving the penetration gap aside, is there anything structural accounting for that difference or do you think ultimately you can get their revenue per relationship up to where yours is?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't know how high broadband penetration can go. I think it continues to rise. I think there are other \u2013 there are substitution possibilities on the margins that are already occurring. But I think that we have a better infrastructure and we've invested in that better infrastructure, and I think we have an opportunity to take significant share. Broadband or high-speed data as a product is in the 80% of households penetration rate already. I think that'll slowly grow. But our share of it has substantial upside and we intend to take advantage of our assets and try to get there as fast as we can.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the...","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","So, Tom, I was thinking of penetration in the context of \u2013 your penetration of your households, so sort of low 40%s now. Can that go into sort of the mid 50%s to high 50%s over time?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what we're trying to do is avoid giving a guidance because typically we don't. And we think we can grow, and that structurally between TWC, Bright House and Charter, there shouldn't be that much difference in terms of where the penetration can get through amongst the three set of assets.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On ARPU, there are structural differences between Time Warner Cable, Bright House and Charter and that's really a function of how they've gone to market. The biggest one is just the amount of single, double and triple play, which I think we and TWC both disclosed if you work through the numbers there. They've been going to market over the past year, year and a half with a pretty similar triple play, but they still have a very different box for equipment pricing model. And that's one of the areas that we're going to have to work through with new pricing and packaging to put that into the Charter format so that you can have longer-term growth with lower amount of equipment rental and in some cases, no equipment rental in the case of modem fees, and so that does make a difference, and it's pretty similar to Time Warner Cable and Bright House.","So there are structural differences in the ARPU. And our goal would be to make sure that as we go through new pricing and packaging, that we actually don't hurt revenue along the way as that continued to grow, both through subscriber volume and customer relationship volume as well as additional PSUs per household.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Great. Thanks guys.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys, thanks. I wonder if you can clarify for us the $2 million broadband expansion on the FCC concession including the $1 million home overbuild. I think there's a lot of questions about that. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'd be happy to discuss that once the transactions have finally been approved and all the documents and information are public. But I don't think right now is the time to discuss it.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, if I can try a different one. On wireless, my understanding is that you're not registered for the auction, and yet we keep hearing people talk about it. Is there any way you can get back involved in that auction?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't think so currently, although there have been cases where auctions have been reopened. But as far as I know, no.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey guys, thanks. Tom, maybe just a comment on programming deals. Seems like the regulators are gung-ho on direct to consumer and sort of trying to limit distribution power, I guess, over programmers, which is, I think, kind of silly. But I'm just trying to get your sense on how you sort of approach those thoughts and whether or not it will have an impact on the cost of programming longer term.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Well, the DOJ's consent decree is actually public, and they made comments in their release stating that there wasn't anything in our particular practices that was concern of theirs. But it was more things they discovered in some of the Time Warner agreements. So, our go-to-market strategy and our programming relationships are designed to encourage the sale of our existing products and the development of over-the-top products.","Our broadband package and the capabilities of our broadband service are realized when customers use it. And they use it when they subscribe to over-the-top services. Video is the most bandwidth-intensive product there is. So, we have a superior network, which we've invested to make superior. We've cleared it to create more spectrum available for broadband. We've taken broadband speeds up and capabilities up, and the way that our drive into the marketplace is accelerated is by people perceiving the value of our broadband, and the way they perceive that value is through over-the-top. So, we can hold all those concepts in our head at the same time and go to market, and we do. And we do think that there \u2013 that the market is evolving and the price value of products are evolving, and we look to take advantage of that where we can, using our scale and using our strategy with programmers and our relationships with programmers to be as efficient as possible.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. If I could just get a little bit of a clarification on the \u2013 on the DOJ piece then as long as it's public. So in the limitation on ADM clauses, I just want to make sure I understand, that wouldn't limit in any way your ability to recognize that the economic value of content is different if it's widely distributed than if it's narrowly distributed. Is that correct?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","And then a question on enterprise. How do you see the opportunity in enterprise as you look forward and think about stepping up into larger businesses beyond the sort of SMB opportunity that you've worked on so far and how much does that require coordination with Comcast?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't think if it requires any coordination per se, but it does \u2013 it is a huge opportunity and we're very underpenetrated, which goes to my comment earlier which is that from our perspective, we're a new entrant, a nascent entrant into an established market. And it's a big market and our penetration is low and our ability to provide high-quality products and to grow that business is good. And so, we don't think it should be necessarily regulated any differently than it is today, but especially for new entrants.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Are there specific products for enterprise customers that you say are more attractive for you initially like, would you say that, first it would be primarily Gigabit Ethernet type of service that you'd be providing and then you would try to sort of move up the value-added stack or have you not really articulated a strategy for large enterprises yet?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I should be clear that we serve the business enterprise space today and we sell 10-Gig Internet products, Ethernet products. And we can sell those through a large portion of our footprint. So, from a technology platform perspective, we're highly capable. And we can create new products and take speeds up, whatever the theoretical threshold speeds are, optically we can do and we can efficiently build fiber optics to enterprise customers. So, we already have a full range of customers and full range of products, but our penetration is relatively low.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","James Ratcliffe of Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. If you could go and take a look at the SMB market for a second, where do you think you are in terms of the process \u2013 of the impact of the revised pricing and product structures on ARPU in that space and when do you think you kind of lapse that impact? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I \u2013 the way to think about it isn't really to think about ARPU, but to think about the growth rate which we set an accelerated 68% year-over-year. So, we actually created lower priced bundles of packages and we're driving much faster and deeper into the marketplace and the revenue growth associated with that will begin to show up in the following quarters and it will track from a curve perspective very similarly to what we've done in the residential business.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Thomas M.

Additionally, all customers and passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO, and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Rutledge ","Thank you, Stefan. 2017 was formative year for the new Charter. We executed well and accomplished what we set out to do in plan. Our integration from three legacy companies to a unified company with one service and operating approach design schedule, our business is growing quickly and the most challenging elements of our integration are behind us.","Our 2017 customer results were as planned. For the full year, we grew total customer relationships by nearly 4% despite all the significant changes we made to our business. Quality sales have increased and the worst of legacy Time Warner Cable churn is behind us. ","In the fourth quarter, we continued to see year-over-year improvement in customer connect volumes in our new markets. Spectrum, our high-value product set is now the majority of our services with over 50% of former Time Warner Cable and Bright House residential customers now subscribing for the Spectrum pricing and packaging. ","All of our video connects are purchasing our expanded basic product and our total expanded video relationships grew again this quarter. We now offer minimum internet speeds of 100 megabits in 99% of our entire footprint, up from just over 50% in June of last year. We grew full year revenue by 3.9% or 4.5% excluding advertising and EBITDA grew by nearly 6%.","In addition to the launch of our Spectrum pricing and packaging, we also made meaningful progress in consolidating our customer-facing applications and platforms in 2017. We\u2019ve reduced and unified our various video applications, so that today, virtually all of our customers, regardless of the footprint or package use a single Spectrum TV app to access our IT-based video products.","We largely integrated our VOD content offerings and we consolidated our sales and service portals. We also continue to integrate our three legacy networks backboned in facilities and to rationalize our IT systems and product and provisioning platforms.","Over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve hired thousands of new employees into good jobs in the communities we serve creating a more in-sourced service and delivery workforce as local hiring is driving higher quality craftsmanship, improved product delivery and better customer experience and at the same time, we\u2019ve rationalized our management structure driving significant reductions to our overhead cost.","In addition to in-sourcing, we\u2019ve also been unifying our service personnel practices, that means having calls from anywhere handled by agents in a consistent way. Our in-market workforce standardization efforts and our simplified pricing and packaging are beginning to drive efficiencies into our operations. ","In the fourth quarter for example, storm-related service call and billing-related calls from legacy Time Warner customers were down by 15% year-over-year and average call handle times have been reduced as our in-house employees provide better, more efficient services. ","Still, 2018 will be another busy year of integration for Charter. We remain focused on a number of key customer-facing initiatives, which will position us for faster customer relationship creation and long-term financial growth. ","We continue to drive penetration of our Spectrum pricing and packaging in our new markets, selling Spectrum branded services to new customers and migrating legacy customers to Spectrum including small business customers. ","That process is underway for over a year, drives one-time investments and puts some short-term pressure on revenue in order to extend customer lives and drive higher customer revenue and returns over time. On the operations front, we\u2019ll continue to in-source more of our field operations and our customer care workforce in 2018. ","We are streamlining our billing platforms and infrastructure by 2019, all of our customer care personnel will be working from a single virtualized platform with unified front-end for all sales, billing, provisioning, service and retention efforts nationwide allowing any one of our care personnel in any call center to handle customer calls from any location in our national footprint. ","In June of last year, we restarted our all-digital project and at the end of 2017, 30% of legacy Time Warner Cable and 50% of legacy Bright House Networks continue to carry full analog video line-ups. Those regions will be fully digitized by the end of this year as we deploy fully functioning two-way digital set-top boxes on all the remaining analog TV appliances that we serve. ","Our video products in those markets will improve. Internet speeds will increase further and all-digital will drive more efficient operations in the field including electronic disconnects, self-installation and a reduction of unauthorized connections. We also continue to develop our core products. ","In 2016 and 2017, we delayed a number of new product launches through the integration, particularly at legacy Charter within our fundamental structured operating model and business rules now in place, we will more aggressively launch new products nationwide.","Our primary hardware for video customers in all-digital will be our Worldbox, our faster, less-expensive and more powerful set-top box which we deployed approximately two million to-date. Over the course of the year, we will expand our streaming video and on-demand library to approximately 50,000 HD titles in multiple digital formats. ","By the end of 2018, we expect Spectrum Guide to be available to essentially all new video customers, allowing us to fully expose the depth of that large content library. That includes legacy Charter markets that are continuous with legacy TWC or Bright House markets from what we call mixed markets like Los Angeles, where we waited to rollout Spectrum Guide to the full DMA at the same time. ","Existing customers in those markets will over time have the choice to switch to Spectrum Guide from their remote. We\u2019ll also begin offering popular third-party applications including Netflix and others on Spectrum Guide making our set-top box a hub for accessing content that originates from us or from somewhere else. ","Those applications will first appear on our Worldbox then across legacy box types over time. As our fourth quarter video results demonstrate, we are having success with our new video products and we are testing and launching new and traditional video stream products with our equipment to better serve the consumer demand for more choices and economical options.","In December, we began launching our gigabit speed offering in several markets using DOCSIS 3.1 technology. Today, we offer gigabit services in eight markets with approximately 9 million passings. ","By year-end, we\u2019ll offer gigabit services in virtually everywhere we serve at all 50 million passings and in December, we raised the minimum Spectrum internet speeds to 200 megabits in markets like New York, Hawaii, Austin and Charlotte at no additional cost to consumers. ","In the fourth quarter, we also began deploying our Wave 2 Wi-Fi router, which offers faster speeds and better propagation and reliability throughout the home.","Turning to Wireless, we are on track to launch our new services in the middle of this year under our MVNO agreement with Verizon. Chris will discuss the financial implications of that launch, but the goal is to create and retain more cable customers. ","Our 5G wireless tests are also going well, as are our 6G tests, which is our pre-spec definition of the integration of small cell architecture using unlicensed and licensed Spectrum working together interchangeably with our advanced DOCSIS roadmap to create high capacity, low latency product offerings. ","We expect that over time, our existing infrastructure will put us in a unique position to economically deploy new powerful products that benefit from small cell connectivity. In 2017, we announced the partnership with Viacom and AMC, which will produce original content for the Spectrum video platform before subsequent windowing. ","Working with our longstanding programming partners allows us to leverage their expertise in creating compelling original content, as well as the defrayed cost. We hired seasoned original content executives to help us manage these partnerships and evaluate new ones with our existing programming partners. ","Our experience with our local Spectrum news networks like New York One and Bay News 9 in Tampa has demonstrated that well-branded, high-quality programming can have a meaningful differentiation and customer retention benefit. ","So we have another busy year of execution ahead with some meaningful product enhancements planned and we remain confident in our plan and our growth potential. ","Before turning the call over to Chris, just a few comments on tax reform and the elimination of Title II. At the end of last year, Congress and the President passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we see as very positive for American competitiveness and a significant incentive for infrastructure development. ","The FCC also eliminated the Title II rules implemented in 2015 in turn to the net neutrality framework that has been in place since the inception of the internet. Charter is committed to net neutrality. We\u2019ve never violated to open internet principles and we have promoted consumer-friendly practices like not imposing data caps we are usage-based billing. ","There is a growing discussion of our permanent legislated solutions to net neutrality principles and online privacy protection, that kind of solution would establish a level-playing field for all companies and we promote regulatory certainty we need to make investments.","Last year I said subject to the tax reform in FCC removing the Title II framework, we would hire over 20,000 American workers and invest over $25 billion here in the U.S. over a four year period. In 2017, we increased our U.S.-based workforce significantly and we increased our capital expenditures by 15% to $8.7 billion. We also increased our broadband availability to underserved communities including rural areas.","Those statistics increased throughout 2017 as we grew more confidence that tax reform and FCC actions promote net neutrality for all market players would be enacted. ","Late in the fourth quarter, we accelerated the 2018 deployment of our Spectrum Giga offerings. In a number of markets, we doubled our minimum internet speeds from 100 megabits to 200 megabits with no additional cost to our customers and accelerated testing of the new integrated wireline and wireless products. ","Tax reform and the removal of Title II overhang incent companies to invest more and build larger U.S.-based workforces with good paying jobs. Based on those regulatory reforms we are announcing today that we are committed to paying every employee at Spectrum at least a $15 per hour income this year. That\u2019s in addition to the significant medical and retirement benefits we\u2019ve already increased for our employees.","Investing in our own locally-based workforce with more training and better wages and good craftsmanship results in higher quality service and drives value into our business. ","Now, I will turn the call over to Chris. ","Christopher Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Before covering our results, a few administrative items; first, I want to remind everyone that when I reference fourth quarter 2017 customer results, I'll be comparing them to the fourth quarter 2016 results that have been adjusted to exclude the seasonal program customer activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 at legacy Bright House. ","We've provided that year-over-year comparison on Slide 6 of today's investor presentation. Additionally, as we head into the second year for integration, the distinction between pure integration activities and the implementation of our operating model is blurry. ","So starting in the first quarter of 2018, we\u2019ll no longer disclose transition expenses in our P&L or transition-related capital expenditures, although this cost will still occur for some time. ","Page 6 of today\u2019s trending schedule provides a mapping of historical transition expense into our regular expense lines. So those would like to adjust models in advance in the first quarter reporting can do so now. ","That trending schedule also shows a line flip we\u2019ll make in Q1, all in down sales and retention expense will move from cost to service customers to marketing where these call center activities are now managed. We haven\u2019t reflected that change in the fourth quarter financials, but wanted to highlight the change before Q1. ","Finally, our fourth quarter 2017 results were modestly impacted by the third quarter storms in Texas and Florida. There was no negative impact to subscriber results or revenue in the fourth quarter and fourth quarter storm-related operating expenses and capital expenditures were immaterial under $10 million combined. ","Now, turning to our results. During the fourth quarter grew by 206,000 or 1 million customer relationships in the last year, with 3.4% growth at TWC, 3.9% at legacy Charter, and 5.4% at Bright House. Including residential and SMB, video grew by 15,000, internet by 300,000, and voice by 53,000. ","49% of TWC and Bright House customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the year. Customer connects were up year-over-year in our new markets and as Slide 6 shows; we grew residential PSUs by 287,000 versus 213,000 last year. Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by 2.5%, pre-deal Charter declined by 1%, and legacy Bright House grew its video customer base by about 0.5%.","Within the quarter, TWC residential video net adds were flat with continued growth in traditional expanded customers, offset by continued churn in migration from the lower base of limited basic customers. ","We also had growth in our stream offerings which is a lower price video product that doesn\u2019t require equipment and is targeted at customers who don\u2019t currently buy a video product from us today. We marketed that product more actively and widely across our footprint in the fourth quarter. ","Legacy Charter lost 10,000 residential video customers in the quarter versus a gain of 20,000 a year ago, driven by our integration focus on the larger acquired footprints. As Tom mentioned, getting to a national product and service standard also caused us to adjust the timing of product upgrades across legacy Charter for over two years. ","In the mean time, we\u2019ve seen some additional competitor build out price and promotional offers advertised by competitors and we have less of a benefit this year from integration struggles at a key competitor. We also merger some legacy Charter markets into the legacy TWC service infrastructure as we created new regional operating areas. ","That puts certain legacy Charter areas into a pre-upgraded state with respect to service. Bright House gained 13,000 video customers versus a loss of 6,000 last year. In total, we added 2,000 residential video customers in the fourth quarter in addition to SMB growth. In residential internet, we added a total of 263,000 customers versus 303,000 last year.","Over the last 12 months, we grew our total residential internet customer base by 1.2 million customers or 5.4%. The 5.1% growth at TWC is 5.6% growth of legacy Charter and 6.9% to Bright House. ","In voice, we grew residential customers by 22,000 in the fourth quarter versus 1,000 last year. The higher triple-play sales offset by higher churn of legacy passages at TWC. So subscribers\u2019 results will continue to improve. We expect further success with a higher portion of the base in Spectrum as well as the launch of new products. ","But, as we said before, the progress will not be linear, particularly as we go through the positive and negative short-term effects of all-digital, new product launches and business integration with each of these often staged cross-markets.","Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 828,000 or 3.3%. ARPU growth remained muted at given modest price increases, continued standalone internet selling, higher selling and promotional rates, the migration activity of legacy TWC and Bright House with Spectrum pricing and packaging. There is also a mechanical ARPU hit from the changes to the legacy Bright House seasonal plan.","Slide 7 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth in the 4.0%. Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined, grew by 6% with SMB up 4.5% and enterprise up by 8.3%. ","Excluding cell backhaul and NaviSite, Enterprise grew by over 12%. Sales are up in both SMB and Enterprise with 32% higher SMB PSU net adds at TWC and Bright House in the fourth quarter versus last year. ","Our revenue growth in the TWC and Bright House markets hasn\u2019t yet followed the unit growth and it won\u2019t until we get through the transition to more competitive pricing of both our SMB and enterprise products. ","We expect that ARPU offset will continue through 2018, but the revenue growth will ultimately follow the unit growth. ","Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 17% year over year, driven by political in the prior year. Excluding political, advertising revenue grew close to 3% year-over-year, given higher year-over-year local, national and digital revenue. In total, fourth quarter revenue for the company was up 3.2% year-over-year and 4.2% when excluding advertising.","Looking at total revenue growth excluding advertising at each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 3.9%, pre-deal Charter grew by 5.1%, driven by customer growth. And Bright House revenue grew by 4.2%.","Moving to operating expense on slide 8, in the fourth quarter, total operating expense grew by $199 million or 3.1% year-over-year. Programming increased 10.8% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases and renewals, and a higher expanded customer base and mix, which accounted for roughly 3% of that programming cost growth. ","For the full year of 2018, we expect programming cost per video customer to grow at a slower rate in 2017. That reflects a significant amount of programming renewed in the last 15 to 18 months and that expected decline in growth rate applies whether or not you include the small investment we expect to make in exclusive original content which Tom mentioned. ","Cost to service customers declined by0.4% year-over-year driven by the benefits from the combination of three companies, productivity benefits from our operating model, partly offset by higher bad debt expense from higher customer acquisition levels and revenue. ","Marketing expenses also improved by 7.8% year-over-year due to the higher level of marketing and sales activity and other expenses were down 2.7% year-over-year driven by the elimination of duplicate cost. ","Adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter including transition costs \u2013 sorry excluding transition cost in both periods, adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.8%. There is still lot of moving parts and we won\u2019t pass of opportunities to grow but the fourth quarter probably reflects the low points of our EBITDA growth rate for cable, which should also benefit from some political advertising later in the year. ","Turning to net income on slide 9, we generated $9.6 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter. $9.3 billion of that is related to a non-cash tax benefit given the reduction in our deferred tax liability as a result of tax reforms. Much of that deferred tax liability was put on the balance sheet as part of purchase accounting related to our transactions. ","We generated $454 million of net income in the fourth quarter of last year due to a gain from the remeasurement of our pension liability. ","So leaving aside the pension gain last year, the tax gain this year, adjusted EBITDA was higher, severance-related expenses were lower and we\u2019ve recognized a $101 million benefit in this fourth quarter from a remeasurement of our liability from the Advance\/Newhouse tax receivables agreement also due to tax reform. Those benefits were partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest expenses. ","Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter including $202 million of transition spend. Excluding transition, fourth quarter CapEx increased by $682 million year-over-year, primarily driven by higher spending on CPE, scalable infrastructure and support. ","Our fourth quarter CapEx included purchases for 2018 activity including significant CPE inventory purchases from the much larger all-digital activity this year and for DOCSIS 3.1 and scalable infrastructure. For both all-digital and 3.1, there was a significant operating and procurement benefit, stage inventory and equipment in 2017 for launches in 2018. ","Excluding the impact of transition in any \u201cpull-forward spends\u201d our fourth quarter CapEx was still higher year-over-year with higher CPE and given higher connect volumes, a higher set-top box placement rate per connect and the migration of legacy customers over to Spectrum for frequently provided new equipment. ","We also had all-digital spend, which excluding the inventory staging I mentioned totaled about $70 million in the fourth quarter. We also spent more in the support categories on vehicles, tools and test equipment, software development and facility spending in each case some to in-sourcing, some related to integration. ","As we look to 2018, our cable capital expenditures should be driven by many of the same factors as last year including customer growth, spectrum migration, all-digital, and in-sourcing and integration. In total, we expect cable capital intensity or capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to be a bit lower than 2017. ","Next year, 2019 that is, should deliver a meaningful decline in capital intensity and dollars. Continued revenue growth improvements remains the best path for that efficiency that all-digital will be complete, we\u2019ll be on the back half of our integration and the bulk of Spectrum packaging and DOCSIS 3.1 upgrade spending will have occurred already in 2017 and 2018. ","And even with video unit growth, the dollars of video CPE should also dramatically drop with a fully deployed base of modern two-way set-top boxes with the DOCSIS modem inside. ","Slide 11 shows, we generated about $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter versus $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of last year and that decline was largely driven by the higher CapEx. ","We finished the quarter with $69 billion in debt principals and our runrate annualized cash interest expense at December 31 was approximately $3.7 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggests a $3.4 billion annual run rate. That difference is due to purchase accounting.","As of the end of the fourth quarter, our net debt to last 12-months adjusted EBITDA was 4.47 times, at the high-end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times.","2017 was a busy year of financings for us. We executed over $26 billion of debt transactions, about $17 billion for refinancing and the balance partly funding our share repurchase. Our refinancings extended the weighted average life of our debt to 11.5 years from the 1.1 at the end of last year and today, over 85% of our debt matures after 2020. So a very attractive maturity profile. ","We also upsized our revolver by $1 billion to enable more strategic flexibility including around buybacks and we did all that without raising the weighted average cost of our debt, which today stands at 5.4% as it did a year ago. ","During the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 13.5 million shares in Charter Holdings common units totaling $4.7 billion at an average price of $347 per share. For all of 2017, we bought back $13.2 billion, also at an average price of $347 per share. ","The Slide 11 shows over a 16 month period, we spent $14.8 billion on repurchases reflecting 14% of the company\u2019s fully diluted equity. The raising of our leverage by about a half turn over the last year to the high-end of our target range reflects the confidence we have in our operating model and what we knew would drive complexity in our operating statistics throughout 2017. ","We are not changing our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times despite the material positive cash flow impacts from tax reform which I\u2019ll cover in a moment. The fact that we are currently at the high end of that leverage range versus a half turn increase in 2017 mathematically means our 2018 buybacks will be less than 2017. ","Some other factors also play a role including the launch of our local products with working capital effects in consumer devices and I don\u2019t expect that we can achieve the same level of working capital improvement for cable in 2018 given the effects of the 2017 CapEx pull-forward on 2018 working capital and our expectation for lower capital purchases in late 2018 with the completion of all-digital and other large integration projects which hasn\u2019t impact to the 2018 working capital. ","So no guidance on buybacks other than, we like what we did when we did in 2017, 2018 will be less and we\u2019ll remain opportunistic to preserve flexibility to create shareholder value without getting trapped by artificial targets. ","Turning to taxes on Slide 13. At Charter, we expect to see significant cash tax savings over the long-term from tax reform. This tax savings and the FCC action to remove the Title II framework will support the significant commitments that Tom made on Charter\u2019s behalf at the White House last year, and the extension of those commitments today. ","The eminent passing of the tax legislation in December was already a factor in the fourth quarter capital investment acceleration I mentioned previously, specifically around the benefits of the fourth quarter 2017 bonus depreciation. ","Anticipating greater regulatory certainty was a key factor in accelerating our DOCSIS 3.1 deployment including Spectrum GIG and increasing minimum internet speeds in a number of markets for Spectrum customers. ","Lower taxes and higher regulatory certainty also create better incentives for new construction, and more rural broadband deployment, which will utilize our deep fiber and anticipated wireless capabilities. We don\u2019t expect the tax build from and that use of our existing NOLs and in the time scope of our current business plan; we do not expect material limitations on our ability to deduct interest for tax purposes if ever. ","We also don\u2019t currently expect to be a material cash income tax payer until 2021 at the earliest and that\u2019s two years later than what we previously expected. ","Given the lower Federal Tax rate, and lower income from bonus depreciation, we estimate the total present value of our tax assets reflecting a later NOL utilization against a lower rate that\u2019s declined from just over $5 billion to about $3.5 billion. That decline is offset by the much larger value associated with net present value of tax reform which drives higher free cash flow in perpetuity. ","Before moving to Q&A, I wanted to provide a financial framework for the launch of our Spectrum Wireless Services later this year. As Tom mentioned, we believe that our entry into wireless can further accelerate customer growth and drive penetration. The more customer growth we generate, the more incremental revenue we\u2019ll generate from wireless and cable. ","Much of that revenue in the beginning will be device contract revenue which is fully recognized on the contract date and similarly, as cost of goods sold under EIP accounting, with the actual customer payments received over a longer period. ","As within the subscription business through upfront launch and acquisition activity which creates OpEx and CapEx which exceed the gross margin benefits in the short-term. The more wireless customer growth we generate early on, the more EBITDA and cash flow drag we experienced in the early day. ","Over time, we expect our Wireless service to generate positive EBITDA on a standalone basis with broader growth benefits to our core cable services. Our wireless business will eventually be fully integrated; it\u2019s just another cable product in the bundle from a marketing care, billing and service perspective. So no different than internet of voice today and it will not be a separate P&L or segment as such.","Through the launch phase however, we will be able to isolate certain key items to create transparency around cable performance. Those items, not necessarily with line-by-line disclosure will include, service revenue, which could be messy with bundle allocation effects of pricing and any subsidies. The device revenue and related cost of goods sold, the MVNO costs, or selling cost and any direct CapEx. ","We should be able to isolate the working capital impacts from the timing of cash flow for device cost and related subscriber cadence. We will provide additional detail from the wireless business as we move through the year and as the business scales, but our current goal is to maintain our target leverage on a consolidated basis even through the launch phase. ","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Bryan Kraft","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just had two questions. One, Chris, can you talk about what the tax rate would be on a permanent basis if you take out the benefits of the NOL and the depreciation timing, so we can start to think about how we model that tax rate in the out years of our models? ","And then, secondly, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about how much of the synergies and dollars have been realized and you are going to no longer disclose those, but, can you just talk about, roughly where you are in realizing the transaction synergies, maybe in terms of rough percentage terms or something, just so we can think about how much still could be on the come as go forward? Thank you.","Christopher Winfrey","Sure. So, in terms of tax reform, one of the key elements in addition to a lower rate was bonus depreciation for the next five years and then, a fairly logical transition out of the 100% bonus depreciation. So your question is, to the \u2013 at the point where Charter does become tax payer, ignoring the ongoing benefits of our NOLs, the effective tax rate should be in the 24% to 25% area all in inclusive of state income tax. ","And as for synergies, we are not providing ongoing disclosure, part of that is also the distinction between what our operating model synergies and transaction synergies; it\u2019s not a bright line. But I think if you take a look at our results which is for all of 2017, and in the fourth quarter, you can see that even in the earnings of cost to serve and in the other expenses and even in the marketing and sales area where we have much higher sales and marketing activity and we have synergies there that are offsetting some of those increases. ","We are doing everything that we intended to do on the synergy side. We expect it to get to the numbers we published over a three year period and we are not quite there yet, but we are well on our way. Given that, I think, I\u2019d like to \u2013 what we are trying to put a pin into because it does become someone\u2019s judgment as to what\u2019s an operating synergy and transaction synergy at this stage.","Bryan Kraft","Okay, thanks very much, Chris. ","Stefan Anninger","Kim, we\u2019ll take our next question please. ","Operator","Thank you and your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open. ","John Hodulik ","Great. Couple ones. First, Chris, there is some nice EBITDA commentary about the low point for cable EBITDA growth. First, a clarification, did that include any sort of impact you are going to see from the wireless launch mid-year? And then, if you could give us anymore color on what drives that accelerating EBITDA growth? ","Is it more revenue-related, more margin-related? And then, maybe for Tom, the 200 megabits per second service, can you give us a timeline for sort of how do you expect that to be rolled out across the U.S.? And I realize it\u2019s early, but any sort of early feedback you can give on in terms of uptake or improving subscriber numbers in those areas? Thanks. ","Christopher Winfrey","The reinvestment in cable be with at in its low point because of the specific to cable and I am not saying that now, just look anybody, but if we are widely successful with wireless and there is upfront cost in terms of sales and marketing as that\u2019s attached to wireless subscriber. ","So I don\u2019t want to get trapped into a point where we are getting curious on something that ultimately is going to have significant cash flow contribution. So we think that Q4 was probably the low point for cable in the diagram and that\u2019s our intention we said it that way. In terms of the sources of that growth, and as subscriber units have improved, and we expect to continue to improve, as many of them give you choppiness along the way, but for the medium and long-term subscriber results it\u2019s improved. ","That has a significant impact on the revenue flow through. We are also coming out of the year where we didn\u2019t have political advertising and into a year where we will have political advertising. So, all of that implies that revenue should be a contributor to that EBITDA growth. We also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we expect a lower rate of programming cost for us, which does have an impact to EBITDA growth rate as well. ","And I think we\u2019ll become \u2013 continue to become more efficient on the operating side. That\u2019s there are some trims up there and we have a lot of in-sourcing investments that are ongoing, but to answer your question, I think it comes from both revenue and it\u2019s certainly in parts of the cost structure continuing efficiency there as well.","John Hodulik ","Great.","Thomas Rutledge","So, John, with regard to our data speeds, so, our plan is to go 1 GIG everywhere in \u2013 that we serve essentially this year. So we\u2019ll have all 50 million passings essentially activated with 1 GIG capability with our advanced wireless product with it. ","So that we can distribute the 1 GIG throughout the home. The 200 megabit upgrade is currently about 18% of our footprint and we have some plans to take that up further this year. But we have \u2013 it\u2019s really a logistical question, part of that is we are offering that to our existing customers as well and in some cases, we have modem transfers to do. ","And so, there are logistical issues in managing that. So we haven\u2019t decided how fast we are going to go with that and how far we\u2019ll roll it out entirely this year. But to sum it up, we plan to be 1 GIG everywhere and marketing 1 GIG everywhere this year, which is taking up a significant portion of our business to minimum speeds of 200 megabits at the same price we were charging the 60 a year ago. ","And we plan to do that as quickly as we can, but because of the all-digital rollout and some of the other operational issues we have, we haven\u2019t fully planned out to do the whole country yet. ","John Hodulik ","Gotcha. All right, thanks guys. ","Stefan Anninger","Kim, we\u2019ll take the next question. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Bazinet ","Just a question for Mr. Winfrey. You do a nice job in your K outlining the aggregate transition expenses over the last three years within OpEx and CapEx. And I was just wondering if you could give any commentary about how much more transitional expense do you expect from current 2018 and is that the last year that there will be transition expenses?","Christopher Winfrey","Let me start with the easy one. No, it won\u2019t be the last year. I think the \u2013 in 2019, we\u2019ll still have \u2013 from an IT infrastructure standpoint some ongoing transition capital in particular and also as we continue to converge some of the core networks into 2019. So I think it will go on through 2019. ","Jason Bazinet ","Okay. ","Christopher Winfrey","The reason we are not longer going to continue to provide that is, as we make changes through the business, some of that\u2019s really just to align to an operating model and sometimes it\u2019s to put in a brand new overlying architecture and because it\u2019s the right thing to do for the overall business or a set, because it\u2019s tied to integration and making a black and white distinction was very easy early on and for coming at the end of 2018, making that distinction in a way that\u2019s faithful that you can lay it out in your 10-K and which didn\u2019t \u2013 we thought that was a little bit harder and maybe less relevant. ","And so, what we wanted to do today is, explain people why we were going to make the change, provide the transparency of where those line items repeat recast in Q1. So that people have in advance to recast it. So I think, you can already see the transition expense from an operating expense, it has been coming down. Some of that is because we are actually coming down in the activity. ","Some of that is because it became harder to define and when in doubt, we put it into the \u201c as usual\u201d just because we rather be conservative. And if that\u2019s the case then, providing that distinction becomes less useful over time to investors and we thought it would be more transparent to show the transition that we tend to do in Q1 and report it back to usual way to getting in Q1 and going forward. ","Jason Bazinet ","Perfect. Thank you. ","Stefan Anninger","Kim, we\u2019ll take our next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reef with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Jessica Reef ","Thank you. I guess, two questions. You talked a lot about the certainty that you now have from regulation and also tax reforms done. How does that play into your views on further consolidation in the industry and how you would view participating in that? And then, secondly, can give us more color on the original content strategy? How much content will you buying from Viacom and AMC? Will it be exclusive? How will you use it or benefit from it? Thank you. ","Thomas Rutledge","Obviously, M&A in the industry, as you are talking about cable M&A as opposed to programming M&A, from our point of view, we like the cable business. We think it\u2019s a good business and we think we can do well on that and if there were opportunities for acquisitions at the right price, we would always be interested in retaining of. ","I don\u2019t know how the tax law or the Title II changes affect the regulatory environment during the M&A if that\u2019s your question. And I am not sure they do, so, you still have all the issues that we\u2019ve always had in the industry in terms of M&A as far as I can see. ","With regard to content, yes, our plan is to work with proven content companies to get economies that work for us in terms of windowing of content as to use that content to create brand halo around our product in an effective way in the marketplace. ","We\u2019ve done two arrangements, one with AMC and one with Viacom and they are slightly different in scope and but they essentially create a window of opportunity for us to use content in a way that fits our customers and still together monetize that content properly over a bigger distribution footprint meaning the world. And so, we\u2019ll see where it goes, but it\u2019s an opportunity to \u2013 for us to be associated for a period of time with the original content. ","Jessica Reef ","Tom, I am sorry. Can just have one follow-up? Does that play into your efforts at all and what you are doing in targeted average pricing and can you give us an update on what advancements you\u2019ve made in advertising? ","Thomas Rutledge","Well, we continue to make significantly advancements in advertising and we are actually pretty bullish on our ability to grow our advertising business. As Chris said in his comments, we actually grew advertising taking political out by 3% last year. ","We are using more advanced data analytics anonymized data analytics to drive better advertising products in the market we have in an all-digital environment, the ability to use our inventory much more effectively and much more targeted way combined with the good data. ","So that, the advertiser gets a more responsive ad and we get a higher CPM and so, we think we\u2019ve got investments planned for 2018 to finish out our platform to deliver that nationwide. We have made significant strides today and so we have a much more advanced advertising platform than we had historically having before beginning to see traction. ","Jessica Reef ","Great, thank you.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Jessica. Kim, we\u2019ll take our next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phi Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Phil Cusick ","Hi, thanks. Two if I can. First, Chris, can you give us some clarity on the rate increases announced so far, both in the legacy Charter and the acquired plans? And how should we think about any ARPU impact this year? And then, maybe Tom, can you talk about wireless a little bit more, for the mid-year launch, should we expect something like a Comcast type MVNO or something substantially different? ","And when could we start to see you offering some type of your own cellular augmentation rather than just using a Wi-Fi in addition to the MVNO? Thank you.","Christopher Winfrey","So, Phil, we have not taken significant rate increases inside 2018, really consistent with our operating philosophy to go for market share growth. We didn\u2019t have some small rate increases to true-up for retransmission expense and that\u2019s flowed through at the beginning of January, but that\u2019s really to offset a direct expense that we have. ","We\u2019ve also harmonized some of our set-top box rates. In some cases, that resulted in a small increase, but as you know from the transition to Spectrum pricing and packaging, in many cases, that\u2019s a dramatic reduction in set-top box fees that are paid by consumers. And so it really was more about standardization and operating increases. ","Those were the two biggest items. We had some other small modifications around the edges, but those are two that drive the most significant portion, but in general, our strategy is to drive revenue growth through unit growth as opposed to simply taking rates, that hasn\u2019t changed. ","Thomas Rutledge","Phil, with regard to wireless, we just had a rollout on mobile product. We already are in the wireless business. Today, we have 200 million authenticated devices connected to our Wi-Fi network. We\u2019ve planned to sell the mobile product using the Verizon MVNO. We haven\u2019t decided how to price it and \u2013 but our long run view of pricing is that, we should offer good value for high-quality products and we should integrate that into our overall product and packaging scenario. So that, the consumer ends up with a set of high-quality product features in a single customer relationship and that those features individually and in aggregate are worth more to the customer than they would be as standalone products. And so we haven\u2019t decided our pricing. I will say just by Comcast and they did a really nice job with their pricing model and it has a lot of very positive attributes. But we have got to decide ours or announce ours.","With regard to the Wi-Fi and latent spectrum opportunities, small cell radios, if that's what you\u2019re referring to, which I referred to in the past as inside-out strategy potential for high-capacity, low-latency services to be delivered to consumer premises and businesses. ","We don\u2019t have \u2013 we\u2019ve been experimenting with various licensed and potentially unlicensed some of those spectrums did unclear of what is long run regulatory standards will be. But we are experimenting with different spectrums that we hope will become licensable or private, along with Wi-Fi, but Wi-Fi interestingly continues to increase in terms of its actual capabilities. ","We are doing this 1 GIG service throughout the country with Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi can handle again. And so, that\u2019s the kind of speed that the people are talking about from a 5G perspective. So, our thought is that, we may want to take additional licensed spectrum and combine it with Wi-Fi spectrum to create an even broader, in-home, in business and mobile platform. ","We don\u2019t have any current plans to launch that in 2018 or in 2019 for that matter. But we are working on the integration of licensed and unlicensed spectrum into the same radios, so that we can improve the already good wireless coverage that we provide at home. ","I think the most interesting fact to consider about, just the MVNO which we are about to enter, 80% of the BPS that mobile carrier customers that will seal on their devices come through our Wi-Fi networks. And so, it\u2019s a robust network, I mean, it\u2019s getting better. ","Phil Cusick ","Thanks, Tom. ","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Phil. Kim, we\u2019ll take our next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open. ","Jeff Wlodarczak ","Good morning. One for Chris and one for Tom. Chris, you bought back dramatically more stock certainly than I anticipated in the fourth quarter and the second half of 2017. Should we assume going forward, you are going to stay at the high-end of your 4 to 4.5 times leverage target? ","And then for Tom, I wanted to get your thoughts on the potential for the government to nationalize a portion of the mid-band wireless spectrum to create a competitor into 5G? And then just, on 5G in general, you\u2019ve done a lot of work on fixed 5G, how much of a competitive threat do you view telcos fixed 5G to your core data bits? Thanks.","Christopher Winfrey","So, Jeff, on the leverage question, and specifically related to buybacks, we did a lot of buybacks last year and the reason that we took our leverage up by half a turn, it\u2019s still within our target leverage range. It was because we knew all the changes that we were making inside the business would make Charter statistically challenged for a short period of time. ","Because the higher amount of sales and higher quality sales were being masked by legacy product churn and migration and it was very difficult despite us talking about it was very difficult for people to see, we have the confidence of where it was going and we thought that was the right window to take our leverage out than buy stock at these prices in effect $347 per share both over the full year and inside of Q4. ","But as you point out, we are now at 4.47 times leveraged. So mathematically, if we are going to stay in our target leverage range and we intend to do so on a consolidated basis including the wireless launch cost, it doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot of headroom. We do have EBITDA growth and we have cash flow and both of those contribute to capacity. ","But I think we did what we did and we\u2019d like to price we did it, liked how aggressive we were and we thought the timing was right and of course in this year, where do we take leverage? It\u2019s too early to say. I think a lot of that is dictated by the opportunity set that\u2019s in front of us. I would say that, if our goal is to stay consolidated leverage at 4.5 times. ","And we are in way to the extent that we become more and more bullish about our ability to drive wireless growth, you would want to make sure that you\u2019ve left enough capacity in your consolidated leverage to be able to still be within the target, that\u2019s our goal. And that you saw M&A opportunities that came about haven\u2019t existed in a material way recently then that would also factor and so wanted to create some headroom. ","And most importantly, as I mentioned before, while subscriber results did what we said they were going to do and continue to do so, there is going to be some choppiness along the way just getting the amount of change that we are driving in the business. So, it won\u2019t be a straight-line. The overall curve over a medium to long-term, we have high confidence in that. ","If there are reactions to choppiness along the way and the opportunity opens up, that\u2019s one of those strategic opportunities, we\u2019d look at it as well. So, no guidance on where we\u2019ll be inside the 4 to 4.5 times and that\u2019s simply because we need to keep that flexibility to go make the right decisions which I think so far, we are pleased with. ","Thomas Rutledge","So, Jeff, as far as the national 5G government built mobile network, which I assume you mean.","Jeff Wlodarczak ","Yes.","Thomas Rutledge","I don\u2019t know there is such a thing architecturally, even possible as a pre-spec notion. There is no 5G spec yet. If they do it in a mobile environment within a massive amount of very tiny cells. And could government manage something like that? It's hard to conceive. ","So, I don\u2019t know any \u2013 I understand the security issues that I think underlie the \u2013 how that can\u2019t just come into the public space and I do think there are significant cyber security issues that we have to deal with as a country and privacy issues that are real policy issues. But I just can\u2019t imagine a nationalized infrastructure and I don\u2019t even know from a mobile platform where the product would be. ","When it comes to 5G, fixed, now I think it\u2019s \u2013 you got to remember 5G is just a format puts in data at a certain speed and there are alternatives to 5G can, which is why we talk about 6G, it\u2019s kind of like that number of longer and its final path, but, there are a lot of ways to get speed. 5G isn\u2019t the only way to provide a high-capacity low-latency network. ","And so, so what is a 5G fixed network? It sounds to me like, it\u2019s a wireless drop that costs more than a wireline drop. And what do you attach it to? You have to attach it to a network, just like you do all wire drop connections. And so, I see all the same kind of costs necessary to build a 5G network as there is to build a wireline network and maybe more. ","And so, we\u2019ll ask \u2013 does that potential exists, does anyone with capital want to do that and will they get a return to that capital? I don\u2019t know, but I think it has much of the same aspects of investments as wireline if not greater. ","Jeff Wlodarczak ","Thank you. ","Stefan Anninger","Kim, we\u2019ll take our last question please. ","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is open. ","Vijay Jayant ","Thanks. Two if I may. Tom, there is some comments that in the prepared remarks about the stream product becoming a bigger piece of the mix. Just want to get thoughts on the virtual MVPDs and how they are scaling? What\u2019s the sort of response broadly in the marketplace and do we expect these IP products to be a bigger piece of the mix going forward? ","And just very quickly for Chris, you obviously talked about the trough, EBITDA trends ex wireless, possibly where they are right now? Can you just talk about the arc on the commercial side where it\u2019s sort of doing the similar thing, is that behind the consumer arc on the recovery? Just for our understanding of scaling of the business going forward? Thanks so much. ","Thomas Rutledge","Well, and let\u2019s ensure and I describe what's going on in the video business and it\u2019s complicated. There is a lot of issues out there. I still think that we can grow video. I think there are lot of pressures in the video business with the pricing and packaging, price of the products and the fact that in order to carry the whole product, again to buy the whole product, as a distributor and which makes the retail price generally expensive for a fully featured service. ","And there are a lot of people being priced out of the market and price value relationship is declining because, among other things, it\u2019s gotten more expensive, but also across but not paying for us has gotten cheaper meaning, with password sharing and lack of control by programmers over their content, you have an easy ability to substitute pay TV for free TV. ","And you can do that with an intent for broadcast television, which is now become an expensive product. And you can do that with streams products that isn\u2019t properly matched. So you have price pressure in the business that\u2019s significant, you have income levels that makes price pressure significant. ","So the overall category is shrinking from pay perspective for all of those reasons and then you have our ability to sell which I think is still good and significant and I think that we have the ability to put better video products in front of the consumer and package them. ","There is no product out there that I can see that we don\u2019t have access to, to sell to our consumers or to provide to our consumers and integrate it with our existing services. So, as if we have an opportunity to continue to have a fully featured video product that meets customer expectations that\u2019s equivalent to what anyone else could do. ","And therefore I think because we have a better business model, and better infrastructure that we can win against the satellite and we can against other wireline competitors in the marketplace and grow our video business. But, the overall category I think still is under enormous pressure for all the reasons I said. ","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Vijay. That ends our call. Thanks operator. ","Christopher Winfrey","Just we didn\u2019t ignore, Vijay, I\u2019ve forgotten, he had the second question on commercial. ","Stefan Anninger","Okay. ","Christopher Winfrey","The commercial migration, what\u2019s happening in commercial, sales are up significantly. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 32% year-over-year growth at TWC and Bright House, on SMB from a unit perspective, that\u2019s really significant and 32% increase in net adds. The trade-off to that is ARPU pressure. And so, similar to residential with migration that\u2019s been taking place. The key difference in SMB and the same applies to enterprise is the pricing differential is greater and the time period for it to occur is longer. ","And so the SMB migration takes a longer period of time as does enterprise. So, I think we are going to see similar pressure throughout 2018. I\u2019m not giving you revenue guidance other than to say, kind of we\u2019ll have positive unit growth, we\u2019ll have positive revenue growth, but it is going to be depressed through 2018 relative to the unit growth until we can get a little bit further on in that migration path and get over the 50% point similar to what we\u2019ve been talking about on residential. So, that, I think that does wraps us up. We apologize and thanks everybody for joining the call. ","Operator","Thank you.

The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint giving us the local and national scale to integrate and grow faster. Our high capacity network now reaches nearly 49 million homes and businesses and we have over 25 million residential and business customers in attractive markets.","Our ability to use mass media effectively has increased from approximately 50% of passings at Legacy Charter to the mid-90% range today. This gives us better local sales, marketing and branding capabilities, service delivery and field operations, efficiencies and a greater ability to reach and serve medium and large commercial customers.","The new scale will accelerate video and advanced advertising product development and deepen our wireless service offerings over time. There are also meaningful one-time transaction synergies which will prove higher than previously outlined. Nevertheless, the execution of Charter's high growth, customer focused operating strategy across a larger service footprint remains the largest contributor to shareholder value in our plans.","Since the close, we found what we thought we would. And we put in place a single centralized operating and financial control structure. We're standardizing our business practices and processes including the IT service infrastructure which will be completed over the two plus years, as well as our products, pricing and packaging across all of our regions over the next year. And finally, we'll continue to develop and launch new products and services which position Charter for long-term growth.","At closing, all of our employees were mapped to their respective business units and executives based on our operating model. Today the bulk of our 90,000 plus employees remain in the field, inside our operating regions and call centers.","We've already began in-sourcing efforts for the new company. The process of in-sourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people, train them and equip them with trucks, tools and test equipment and house them in new and expanded facilities. That process has already started as we are building Charter's first Spanish language call center in McAllen, Texas with approximately 600 seats.","Ultimately, with a more local work force, we'll perform higher quality transactions with customers which we expect will improve customer satisfaction, reduce transactions and costs and extend average customer lives thereby growing our customer base and cash flow efficiently.","In the fall, we will begin to rebrand Time Warner Cable and Bright House and launch our Spectrum pricing and packaging in a number of key markets totaling over 40% of our acquired passings with the remainder in the first half of 2017.","On the small and medium business side, we'll launch the full Spectrum small business product, pricing and packaging in TWC and Bright House markets in early and mid-2017","In 2017, the all-digital project at Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets will use the Charter all-digital strategy, which uses fully functioning two-way set-top boxes with video on demand and advanced guide functionality on every TV outlet. We expect the project to be completed by 2018. We will also extend our practice of performing electronic connections instead of physical truck rolls as we go all-digital, allowing us to fully scale our self-installation and self-service practices.","Our plan is to have Spectrum Guide available in most Legacy Charter markets by the end of this year. We will launch Spectrum Guide in TWC's larger markets by the middle of 2017 and other TWC and Bright House markets following through the year and likely continuing through 2018 as we complete the all-digital project.","Now that we're closed, we're running a Wi-Fi network in public spaces throughout the country as well as on a widely distributed indoor terrestrial wireless network. Which combined with MVNO opportunities and other wireless building blocks should allow us to create products and services with a high value proposition. Over time, we'll have more to discuss on this subject.","Chris will cover the second quarter results in more detail in a moment, but the overview is that Legacy Charter continued to perform very well in the quarter, with better subscriber growth than the prior year and on a standalone basis through closing, Legacy Charter continued to show double-digit in improving EBITDA growth.","Bright House also improved its customer performance year-over-year. While Bright House has benefited from Frontier's acquisition of certain FiOS properties, it should be noted that because most of its footprint is in Florida it is subject to greater second quarter seasonality than both Charter and Time Warner Cable.","Legacy Time Warner Cable is in better shape than just a couple of years ago, with growth in customer relationships. During the second quarter last year, Time Warner had a very aggressive voice promotion, making voice net add comparisons with this third quarter negative. However, our second quarter pro forma results have to be seen in context because they reflect the continuation of previous operating strategies much of which are different from our plan.","Through different metrics and stages of development, we can see that TWC and more recently, Bright House had both become reliant on rate increases and retention offers, each of which has various short and long-term effects including encouraging customers to initiate more transactions. We've addressed these types of issues at Legacy Charter and we'll do so at TWC and Bright House during the Spectrum pricing and packaging migration.","Generally though, we're very pleased with how TWC and Bright House managed the assets through closing.","Our pro forma total customer relationships increased by 173,000 during the second quarter compared to 54,000 last year. And our year-over-year pro forma revenue growth of 6.6% and pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% in Q2 demonstrates the health of our business. We will make the necessary investments using the same approach we used at Charter to put the new assets on the right long-term growth strategy. The big difference today is that we have an established management team with experience running our operating plan. And TWC and Bright House are in better condition than Legacy Charter was four years ago. And we have meaningful transaction synergies which will help offset short-term effects and investments we need to make to create long-run operating momentum in the marketplace.","Now, I'll turn it over to Chris.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Tom. I'll largely focus on pro forma results as comparisons to prior-year actuals aren't helpful given the size of the transactions. Before going there though, I think it makes sense to get set the baseline for the new company by walking back through the basic building blocks.","On slide 8, you should see a summary sources and uses statement for the transactions. On the left-hand side of the slide under Sources, you can see that the amount of debt that we issued for our transactions totaled approximately $23.8 billion composed of $21.8 billion for the TWC transaction and $2 billion for the Bright House transaction.","We also assumed approximately $22.5 billion principal value of TWC investment grade debt already in place. And we issued approximately $33 billion in Charter stock to Legacy TWC shareholders valued at the closing date, about $10.2 billion to Advance\/Newhouse in the form of preferred and common partnership units also valued at the closing date, and $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive in exchange for cash valued at the signing of the deals, all totaling about $96 billion in sources and uses for our transactions. And other than the impact of a higher Charter share price at closing, the sources and uses were essentially as we outlined at signing.","From the beginning, we carefully structured our transactions with TWC and Bright House in order to achieve a number of operating, tax and financing objectives. By providing pari-passu bank loan security to investment grade bondholders, we now have access to virtually all pockets of the debt markets, including long dated low-cost financing without separate financing silos.","The debt we issued to finance our transactions was placed in the investment-grade market, the term loan market, and in the high-yield market. And as slide 9 indicates, our total debt outstanding now stands at just over $60 billion compared to our June 30 market cap of approximately $71 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 5.5%, 87% of which is fixed, with an average maturity of 11.5 years and close to 90% due after 2019.","Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting which revalued assumed TWC debt to fair market value on the balance sheet, our total net debt to last 12 month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.4 times. It was 4.2 times pro forma for year one run rate synergy estimates. Our target leverage range remains at 4 times to 4.5 times, and we'll target the lower end of that range.","We've also committed to remain at 3.5 times or below the first lien level for CCO and maintain eligibility for inclusion in the Investment Grade Index. Given our EBITDA growth profile and positive cash flow, we expect to delever rapidly, providing us with excess capacity relative to our leverage targets.","We could use that excess capacity in a number of ways, but in order of priority: we'll invest in our business, including areas that provide faster and more sustainable growth; pursue accretive M&A when available and ready; return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases; and if we had no better use of cash or determined it prudent to reduce our target leverage, we'll pay down debt.","Turning to our ownership structure, as slide 10 shows, as of June 30, public shareholders held 68% of Charter. Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive together held an economic and ownership stake in Charter of approximately 19%.","On an as-converted and as-exchanged basis of its partnership units, Advance\/Newhouse held an economic stake in Charter approximately 13% and had governance through its corresponding B share at the corporate level. We currently have 13 board members, composed of eight unaffiliated board members including Tom, our Chairman, three Liberty-related board members and two Advance\/Newhouse affiliated board members.","The right-hand side of slide 10, you'll see that at closing, Charter had approximately 270 million shares outstanding, however, including the impact of Advance\/Newhouse fully converting and exchanging its common and preferred partnership units, Charter's outstanding shares totaled 311 million. Those partnership units are exchangeable at any time, so it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as converted and as exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value in most share-based metrics.","So, now, let's continue to only look at the outstanding shares, which drives large differences in reported market capitalization. Turning to the presentation of our financials on slide 11, the slide lists some of the key transaction related accounting items, some of which are one-time in nature. Starting with revenue at the top of the slide, our pro forma results eliminate a number of revenue items including within Legacy TWC revenue, the management fee from Bright House that previously existed. And in consolidation, affiliate fees for the Dodgers and Lakers RSNs that TWC received from Charter and Bright House. Additionally, certain items like late fees, which were previously classified as contra-expense at TWC and Bright House, have been reclassified into revenue at each Legacy entity.","Turning to operating expenses. We've made the same revenue related re-classes and mapped TWC and Bright House expenses into our operating model. We've also conformed accounting policies across the three companies with the largest difference being the level of capitalization at Bright House as expected.","For Legacy TWC, we also moved both gains from sale of fixed assets and noncash share-based compensation below adjusted EBITDA. And under purchase price accounting, we've posted a liability on our balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the out of market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. While there's no change to the cash payments, the P&L expense associated with the rights fee was already lower in Q2. That expense is included in the regulatory, connectivity, and produced content line on our P&L.","Below the adjusted EBITDA line, there were also a number of items to note. For purchase price accounting, we stepped up the value of TWC and Bright House assets on our balance sheet to fair market value, including PP&E and customer relationships. As a result, the depreciation and amortization charges are and will be higher than the simple addition of historical D&A.","At closing, we also replaced TWC employee stock awards with Charter stock awards. The post-closing vesting of these awards increases stock compensation by reflecting the fair value of these replacement stock awards at closing instead of their original grant value. We also booked a number of merger and restructuring expenses in the other operating expense line, including one-time contingent fees at close for transaction advisory, including legal M&A advisory at both TWC and Charter, and financing fees.","And employee severance expenses of roughly $300 million, nearly half of which came from the accelerated vesting of stock at the now stepped up purchase price value. The rationalization of three corporate groups will likely take a year, and so we expect to continue to see severance in the other operating expenses line for several quarters.","Post-closing, we announced a new retirement program across the company, which is designed to be competitive in the marketplace and give employees more control over their retirement funds through a higher defined contribution match. The Bright House defined benefit plan had already been frozen by Advance\/Newhouse at just prior to close and remains with Advance\/Newhouse.","However, as part of the new retirement program at Charter, we recorded a one-time curtailment gain when we announced in June that we will freeze the TWC benefit plan \u2013 defined benefit plan at the end of August. For those who are interested this means using the ABO instead of the PBO when measuring the net liability.","Purchase price accounting also resulted in a step-up in the value of acquired TWC debt to its fair market value as of the closing date. The premium between the fair value at closing and the principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt driving GAAP interest expense well below cash interest expense.","Our run rate annualized cash interest expense is $3.3 billion, whereas the Q2 pro forma P&L interest expense was adjusted $3.9 billion annual run rate. We refinanced some existing Charter debt in the quarter, driving charges in the loss on extinguishment of debt line. The loss on financial instruments line reflects a one-time termination expense for TWC's interest rates swaps and a change in valuation of Legacy TWC British pound debt and related currency swaps.","Turning to tax expense, nearly all of the $3.3 billion valuation allowance against Legacy Charter's deferred tax assets was removed given the greater visibility and certainty around the use of Legacy Charter's NOLs on our consolidated tax return. That drove a one-time tax benefit of nearly $3.2 billion in the quarter.","We're also now expensing a quarterly charge of approximately $38 million in preferred coupon for Advance\/Newhouse's preferred partnership units. That charge is being reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense along with backing out that portion of consolidated net income attributable to Advance\/Newhouse's common partnership units.","Finally, as you review our trending schedules, keep in mind that all customer and passings data that you see are based on Legacy company definitions. In a few quarters' time, we'll recast the customer data and the trending schedules using the same set of common definitions. When we do that, the goal will be to recast all historical data as well. And until then, certain data like net adds and ARPU, they remain relevant for legacy entity trends but they're less helpful in comparing one entity to another.","So, moving on to Q2. Although second quarter results really just reflected the sum of three different operating strategies, I wanted to provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter customer and financial results on a pro forma basis.","Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, 4.8% at TWC, 6.3% at Charter, and 4.1% at Bright House. During the second quarter in which Bright House Florida seasonals amplified the normal second-quarter cable seasonality, we grew residential PSUs by 167,000 versus 201,000 on a pro forma basis last year.","The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was driven by Pure Voice net additions this quarter, in particular due to a low-price voice offer in TWC markets in Q2 of last year. In residential video, over the last year, TWC was essentially flat on subscribers, Charter grew by 1% video, and Bright House lost 3.6%. Quarterly video net losses improved year-over-year at both Bright House and at legacy Charter, while TWC's video net loss was 28,000 worse than last year primarily driven by an increase in churn.","In total for Q2, we lost 152,000 residential video customers, of which about half came from normal video, normal Florida seasonal downgrades. That loss is an improvement to a loss of 170,000 total video customers in Q2 pro forma last year.","In residential Internet, we added a total of 236,000 customers in the quarter versus 157,000 last year. And our total Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.5% over the past year.","In voice, we grew customers by 83,000 versus 214,000 last year really driven by the difference in offers in the marketplace at TWC and a higher amount of single-play Internet selling at Bright House. Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million customers or by 4.8%. Over the same period, residential ARPU was up by about 1%.","As slide 14 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 5.6%. Excluding pay-per-view revenue, which included the Mayweather-Pacquiao event in Q2 of 2015 for all three companies, consolidated residential revenue grew by 6.3% and consolidated residential ARPU by 1.7%. Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 13.4%.","At Legacy Charter, we introduced new pricing and packaging in both SMB and enterprise last year and we're seeing the significant increase in sales and net adds we expected. We intend to make similar changes to Legacy TWC and Bright House SMB and Enterprise by next year.","Finally, Advertising was up 3.9% with political revenue growth accounting for about half of the $15 million growth year-over-year. In total, second quarter pro forma revenue was up by 6.6% year-over-year or 7.2% excluding pay-per-view.","Looking at total revenue growth at each of our Legacy companies including the effect of less boxing pay-per-view, TWC revenue grew by 7.2% although excluding the recognition of revenue associated with settlement of a contractual dispute, revenue grew by 6.8%. Legacy Charter grew by 6.7% or 7% when excluding a one-time charge for customer credits in the quarter. And Bright House revenue grew by 3.3% or 3.0% when excluding the benefit from the same settled dispute at TWC.","Turning to first (sic) [second] (23:39) quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 15. We've generally mapped all TWC and Bright House operating expenses to Legacy Charter's expense categories. Although, there will likely be some expense remapping in subsequent quarters. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses grew by $326 million or 5.3% year-over-year, in line with total residential and SMB customer growth of 5.1% with transition expense accounting for $25 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 7.5% year-over-year driven by contractual rate increases partially offset by lower pay-per-view cost.","Looking at programming this quarter really is not that representative, as we had a big quarter closing, that drove recurring benefits in the Q2 sub period and we also had a number of one-time non-recurring charges at Legacy Charter including some fees which were contingent on closing. As a conforming accounting policy, we've also re-classed ad buy obligations to ad revenue instead of contra expense to programming on the TWC side of the ledger. Net-net, I expect our programming line item and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by the end of this year.","Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were virtually flat year-over-year and benefit from the purchase accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I mentioned earlier. Cost to service customers grew by 2.1% despite overall customer growth of 5.1% which really reflects the significantly lower service transactions at Legacy Charter and other expenses grew by 8.5% driven by higher corporate administrative labor cost again on a pro forma basis, including pre-closing bonus accrual true-ups, higher IT resources at Legacy TWC, advertising sales cost and enterprise sales and labor costs, partly offset by overhead reductions which only started in June. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes noncash share-based compensation grew by 9%. Excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%.","There were clearly a lot of moving pieces this quarter both from an accounting treatment perspective as well as nonrecurring items but excluding that noise, the pro forma growth rate was probably more in the 7% to 8% range. And as we make the changes Tom laid out, there'll be a lot of activity impacting the financials through different subscriber vintages until we have a consistent product and service across our entire footprint.","Bigger picture is Legacy Charter EBITDA growth for April and May without any synergy benefit was well into double-digit growth reflecting the benefits of our operating model and what we intend to do with the larger set of assets long term.","Due to the mid-quarter closing of our transactions there is little to talk about with respect to realized operating cost synergies in our Q2 results. We do, however, expect synergies to materialize in the second half of this year, and we'll highlight estimates of what's in the quarter going forward. We've already concretely identified run rate annualized transaction related operating expense synergies of over $600 million by the first anniversary of close. And we expect our initial synergy outline of $800 million per year by year three will be exceeded.","At Charter we define transaction synergies as those which result purely from the combination of the companies. They do not reflect operating synergies which come from operating decisions and investments that increase revenue and lower service transaction cost.","Turning to slide 16 where we share both pro forma and actual net income for the second quarter. Our actual second quarter income statement reflects Legacy Charter's results up to May 18, plus the results of the three legacy entities from May 18 through June 30. It also includes one-time expenses that are directly tied to the closing of the transactions.","Conversely, the pro forma P&L assumes the three legacy entities had been one company and excludes one-time expenses and benefits that are directly tied to the closing of the transactions. The background I provided on purchase accounting earlier and the detailed schedule on slide 16 should help people understand the P&L down to net income on both a natural basis and on a pro forma basis.","On our actual P&L, the biggest driver of net income is clearly the one-time benefit of the valuation allowance release of $3.3 billion. With TWC and Bright House income, the timing and visibility of utilizing our NOLs on a consolidated tax return is no longer uncertain from an accounting perspective.","The non-controlling interest expense line will be a recurring charge on our income statement as long as Advance\/Newhouse holds an interest in the partnership.","Turning to slide 17, pro forma capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, including $111 million of transition capital expenditures. Excluding transition CapEx, our second quarter CapEx was up by $137 million or 7.5% year-over-year driven primarily by the TWC Maxx all-digital initiative, what looks to be some pull forward spend on CMTS and network routers at TWC pre-close in the scalable infrastructure line, investments in product development at both Charter and TWC, which also falls in scalable infrastructure, as well as previous leasehold improvement and real estate investments at TWC, including data center, warehousing and headend initiatives, which were booked in support capital.","In Q2, excluding transition capital, TWC spent capital of approximately 21%, Charter 18%, and Bright House 15% of revenue, respectively. Going forward, obviously we'll reduce the spend on IT, product development and other areas which were by definition duplicative. We should see a short-term benefit from the regrouping on the remaining all-digital projects as Tom outlined.","Slide 18 shows the actual free cash flow we generated in the second quarter and only reflects Legacy Charter's results through May 17 plus the results of the three Legacy entities from May 18 to June 30.","Finally turning to our tax assets on slide 19, at the closing of our transactions and as expected, we had a change in ownership as per Section 382 of the IRS Code, which re-restricted the availability of our NOLs. We believe the net present value of our tax assets was not impaired. The transactions create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus their utilization pace at Legacy Charter.","Today, we're providing a preliminary updated NOL availability schedule which you can see at the bottom left-hand side of the slide. As the chart shows, we expect the vast majority of our $11.5 billion of our NOLs will be available for use by the end of 2018. As of now, we don't expect to be a material cash income tax payer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pre-tax income, excluding the impact of higher depreciation and amortization from purchase price accounting, should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter.","With that, I'll hand it back to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Chris. Thanks for getting that off your chest. Just a few final comments before turning it over to Q&A. Since our closing on May 18, we've been working to integrate the three companies. And while integrating three large companies comes with issues and execution risks. We're picking our way through those issues and so far, we haven't seen anything that precludes us from being successful. Our track record at Charter over the last several years shows our operating model produces excellent economic value, and we'll make the right investments as quickly as possible to apply our operating practices on the new assets.","With our newfound scale comes additional opportunities unavailable to Legacy Charter including cost savings and purchasing opportunities, product development opportunities, commercial services opportunities, wireless service opportunities and more, and we're ready to exploit those opportunities in order to drive greater growth and value into our business.","Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Your first question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks. I have two questions if that's okay. Tom, you alluded to wireless in your opening remarks. And as part of the merger, you did receive Time Warner Cable's access to the Verizon MVNO. Has Time Warner Cable or you, Charter, notified them of your intention to utilize that, and how do your rights differ from Comcast's if they do?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know exactly what's in Comcast's rights structure, but I believe they're similar because they were created at the same time as part of the same transaction. And we have not fully exercised that right yet.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Anything you want to say on timing?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're looking at what those rights are and how we'll execute or how we'll utilize them for the best benefit of the company, but we don't have a plan yet that we're ready to roll out.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then, the second completely different subject, but given your new footprint \u2013 your new enlarged footprint and the scale that you get in much bigger markets, can you talk a little bit about, you also alluded to this in your opening remarks, the advertising opportunity? You mentioned addressable advertising. What are your plans and where does this fall in your priority list?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's two parts of the scale that are interesting. One is we're a much bigger company. And if you just take the Charter growth strategy and apply it to a much bigger set of assets and you do the same thing on those assets, get the same kind of growth rates, you create a lot of value. But the other part of scale that comes out of this is that the footprint, the coverage of the DMA and our ability to use mass advertising, as well as sell advertising in the DMA is improved by the efficiency of our coverage of local markets, meaning in historic terms, we're better clustered.","So, we have our ownership of assets by particular DMA more concentrated than we did at Charter. That gives you two things. It gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of services and products and it gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of advertising and targeted advertising in local products sold at \u2013 on all the various platforms, the TV, the Internet and voice platforms, wireless platforms, and it also gives you, from a commercial sales perspective, a more likely footprint to serve medium-sized businesses and all the facilities those businesses pass or use within your footprint.","So, if you have a multi-site business, your ability to serve multi-sites with better footprint is improved, and so the commercial marketplace is also improved. So, the whole footprint is more efficient.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. I wonder if you could talk about the programming agreement step downs that you've had and there have obviously been a couple of lawsuits. Can you talk about what you anticipated in the relationships with your programmers and what kind of response you've had from other programming partners with respect to stepping them down onto the Time Warner Cable agreements?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the nature of programming relationships hasn't fundamentally changed, and it's still a contentious contractual environment. But, generally, we have good relationships with our programmers, and I think the litigation is part of the negotiation process in general. And it's going about what we thought it would go.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's helpful. And if I could just ask one additional, much more general question, you talked about that what you've found so far doesn't change your confidence at all. But, can you talk about any particularly big surprises you've come across as you finally gotten inside of Time Warner Cable and Bright House? Anything that jumped out at you as I wouldn't have expected this, and there is either real opportunity or potentially some peril here?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say that I'm surprised by anything. We have a pretty good visibility into these businesses. I have managed Time Warner assets in the past, now granted, it's 15 years ago. But, for instance, I knew about seasonality in Florida, having managed those assets in the past, with snowbirds and so forth. And I would say that the pricing and packaging and the variability of offers is the most interesting opportunity to fix quickly. It creates a lot of activity and confusion in the marketplace both for the consumer and for the employees of the company.","And so, I think having a more logical, efficient selling machine will cause a lot of activity to go away quickly. And there's a lot more complexity there than even I thought was there. All of which means there's more upside.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. We'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask you if you could comment on how disruptive or not you expect the repricing and repackaging of services in the acquired operations to be to your subscriber and ARPU trends. Should we expect some noise in the numbers for a while?","And then separately, is there anything that you need to do that's significant to the plan in the acquired operations before you can deploy the Spectrum Guide or is that something that you can do fairly easily? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Look, the pricing and packaging is mostly done incrementally. But it does require you to retrain your workforce and to set up processes to provide the products that you want to sell. So, we need to make sure that we have an advanced video product in every market where we launch pricing and packaging that our data speeds can be taken up to where they need to be.","And it's logistically complex but not that disruptive to the consumer. What is disruptive to the consumer, though, is continued all-digital rollouts. That requires hardware going into consumer homes. So, about 40% of Time Warner assets are not all-digital currently, and 50% of Bright House are not all-digital.","So, those transactions are more disruptive, but necessary in order to get you in a place where you have a superior product set relative to all your competitors. If you look at the history of Charter and its growth rate, and its trending schedules as you'd inquire about, they're a good proxy for what we expect to happen going forward in these new assets. The difference in these assets is that physically, they're in better shape, so there's probably less capital required in them. But from a consumer perspective and driving revenue and driving consumer stats, the Charter experience is a good proxy.","With regard to your question on the guide, yes, there are some issues around the guide in rolling it out in the new assets. And they have to do with provisioning systems. So, you have three different companies that talk to their hardware; modems, voice devices, as well as TV set-top boxes and create the billing environment and the control environment around all of that hardware in the field, as well as the billing environment that goes over top of that.","All of those things are separate functions that have to be integrated and require an IT infrastructure over top of all of the existing Legacy's structures to unify what products can go where. And the guide, to some extent, has to wait for that physical infrastructure to get put in place. So, we think we can do that as we roll out the all-digital strategy. And we don't think it's gating or anything like that, but it takes time and it's complicated.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Two quick ones, if I may. First, I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the higher churn you saw in the Time Warner Cable footprint, specifically for video?","And secondly, on the synergies. Chris, I think you said by the time you hit your first year anniversary, synergies should clock in at about $600 million. Was that for that first year period or would that be the run rate in sort of the second quarter of next year?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","That's the annualized run rate by the time we get to the end of the first year of $600 million. You'll recall that, I think, originally, we had said that was about $400 million at the time of the announcement of the transaction. If I remember, I think it was $500 million for financing purposes. So, it's higher than what we expected to be a run rate by the end of the first year since close.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With regard to your question on higher churn. First, we weren't managing those assets through the quarter, most of the quarter. And so, we don't have a direct connection to what happened or is happening. But it's really a function of the pricing and packaging and the way that the business has been marketed, and our view is that both Bright House and Time Warner pricing and packaging lend themselves to higher churn than the way Charter prices and packages.","And so, until we get the business priced and packaged properly, we'll have churn rates in the legacy properties probably higher than Legacy Charter. At least that's our expectation. So, as a result of that, our strategy is to change the way those businesses market their services.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","So, Tom, does that mean that you'd expect to see sort of the higher churn rates for the next sort of several quarters as you get more of the base onto Charter-style packages?","And I guess as a sort of second follow-up, it seems like the adds were a little bit worse year-over-year, so the sort of the churn rates were maybe higher amongst that base this year than a year ago on those kinds \u2013 on the legacy Time Warner Cable packages, I'm wondering if you have any insights at this point into what could have driven that?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Hey, Jonathan. This is Chris. What you're getting at is actually really complex because of all the different transactions that are involved, but I'll try to simplify it a little bit. There was a higher amount of churn at Legacy TWC in Q2. A lot of that was also coming from downgrades at the point where we had promotional pricing roll-off. That's a function of not having the highest quality product that you could offer in place at the best price you could offer and making it competitive in the marketplace and not having a consistent way of rolling the pricing up at promotion, which means essentially that the product doesn't stick.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Right.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So, in terms of going forward, the more the base that you can get on pricing and packaging, the more sticky that base becomes not only in the face of competition but also in the context of step-up in price. But you're still exposed along the way to the Legacy base that hasn't migrated to new pricing and packaging as to what happens to them at roll-offs, what you allow them to roll off to, what retention offers you have in place, and how quickly you can either proactively or reactively migrate that base into the new pricing and packaging. It's fairly complex. No different than what was done at Legacy Charter in the 2012 to 2014 time period. So, we'll just manage through it the same way that we did then.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks, Chris.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I have one for Tom and one for Chris. Tom, when you look at the new footprint, you've got a lot of broadband-only customers. I think something like 7 million plus. How are you thinking about marketing video to them maybe in a way that hasn't been done before either at scale or in the industry? Anything at this point that you're thinking about from a product offering or technology perspective to sort of get at that opportunity?","And, Chris, if you go back to the expense growth in the quarter, I think you gave us pro forma growth for programming, cost of serve and G&A \u2013 and other of like 7.5%, 2% and 8.5%. But there's a lot, as you point out, a lot of moving pieces there. Is there a way to think about either clean versions of those three numbers or even directionally whether the sort of real underlying trend is higher or lower than these metrics you gave in the release? Just as we think about sort of the natural cost growth trend of the business through the rest of this year. Any color would be helpful if you had any.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Ben, I think the biggest opportunity continues to be selling against satellite. If you look those 7 million data only subs, a substantial portion of them are satellite customers.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that has to do with the analog nature of the video product that the cable companies sell. And by going all-digital and using your two-way interactive platform, you can build a better video product than your competitors, in my opinion, which is why I think Charter is growing its video business year-over-year. It's a slow process. The inertia is real in the marketplace. But it's \u2013 I think, Charter has turned the video business positively, and I think the same is possible in Time Warner and Bright House, but it requires the proper investment in a video product, which means you need a two-way product with an excellent user interface and all the functionality and features that you get from an Internet type like service with live, fully-featured content.","So, I think there's still lots of upside selling traditional MVPD products, the cable service to customers who have broadband only. That said, there is an income issue with television. It's very expensive to buy the whole package. It's hard to sell smaller packages that resonate in the market and are sticky and satisfy consumers. And various marketing tactics have been tried to skinny down the product. The problem is skinny-ing it down to the right place with the right package and satisfying people who are financially challenged. And we'll continue to explore relationships with content companies to do that. But I also think that you can make a fully featured service more attractive and more worth what it does cost. And we can use that to drive into the marketplace.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","On the expense side, Ben, I don't want to get into the mode of providing guidance, but based on what I've already said, I think you can deduce a few things going through the three categories that you listed. Programming, we only had half a quarter, in essence, of Charter being in a closed status. And in addition to that, you had a number of one-time bad guys at legacy Charter, some of which was contingent fees that are going to be paid on closing to programmers.","So, by definition, that means that result improves. Going against that grain over time is that if you're putting a rich video product into the marketplace and you're selling more expanded as Tom was talking about, that's not rate-based growth of programming. That's volume-based that's accompanied by higher revenue and less churn. So, we look at the transaction piece of that as rate versus volume.","The second piece that you highlighted was cost to serve, where the cost to serve is really benefiting from the significant operating synergies that exist at legacy Charter as a result of having a simpler product in the marketplace for customers knowing that when you step up rate that is a fair rate and not continuing to keep on calling in to do a deal, reduces your call volume, reduces your churn. And in-source labor being \u2013 in-source labor also being a key function as well. Then going the other way, so that's legacy Charter which is really helping the results.","We're going to continue to in-source at TWC and Bright House. It's going to create some of the same pressures that we saw at Charter in the cost to serve line at the beginning, as we in-source a labor force that needs to be trained up and you have parallel outsourced resource in place while you're doing that. So, it's going to be dynamic as we go.","For the other category, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this includes corporate, advertising, enterprise, and particularly from a corporate perspective, a lot of the head count reductions didn't really occur or begin to occur until June. And those will be continuing on for some time, so there should be some improvements in that line item on a go-forward basis.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","And look, our goal here is even if it costs us a little bit more by putting a richer product in place on programming or whether it costs us more up front to put in-sourcing in place for cost to serve and things like IT and whatnot, is to generate operating leverage at the back end by being able to scale it upfront and reduce transactions over time and make more of the revenue flow through to EBITDA.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, I think we have time for one last question please.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Chris, you stated before, you've given Charter CapEx guidance. Can you help us with CapEx expectations for the rest of the year? Should we look for some growth slowdown in the next couple of quarters before an acceleration in 2017?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So, we're not going to be providing CapEx guidance. But I think the thing that is clear is that the \u2013 one of the big drivers for spend in the first half of the year on a pro forma basis, again managing \u2013 it wasn't us managing the combined CapEx, we're just reporting on it today on a pro forma basis. But there is, obviously, the significant amount of all-digital activity that was continuing at TWC. And that will be largely put on hold as we put in the Charter all-digital strategy the beginning of next year.","The results of some what I believe is pull-forward of good capital, but significant pull-forward of capital around CMTS and routers and some of that type of activity that should slow down a little bit as well. But the danger in providing CapEx guidance or even expectations is, frankly, if we see the opportunity to go make an investment that's going to put the company in a position to grow faster, then we're going to do that inside of a particular quarter or inside of a particular last 12 months or fiscal year.","And our view on the trends of CapEx is that capital intensity will go down significantly once we get through the all-digital program. But from a timing perspective, we see opportunities to grow faster by investing quicker, even though the total gross dollars invested may not be any different. We'll pull it forward as we need to and we don't want to be beholden to slowing down the growth trajectory of the company to meet what is in our view kind of an artificial target. So, no, we won't be providing an outlook for this year. But I think if you take a look at the way that we've managed capital in the past at Charter. It's meant to be efficient and to drive faster growth.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And even at the current CapEx run rate, it seems like you're delevering very quickly and could head to that 4 turns leverage range right around the end of the year. Is that a fair way to look at it, and is there any reason you wouldn't be returning capital if you got to that point?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So, now, you're backing me into guidance. So, look, the business is delevering at, call, it half a turn a year, that's what we expected even though CapEx was being spent at a more elevated level, and it included the duplicative portion of the CapEx, which is three different companies spending on IT and different types of product development and those kind of corporate expenditures as they spend at least two or if not three times over. So, that's another area that it should automatically get more efficient.","But, yeah, I think, we're going to delever fast and it's a first-class problem to have is to where to deploy the capital which is why I've spent some time on it in the past couple of calls and make sure people understand the priority of how we'll opportunistically deploy our excess free cash flow over time.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, Chris.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, that ends our call. Thank you.","Christopher L.

The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent proxy statements and Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Stefan. Our core strategy to deliver superior products at highly competitive prices combined with outstanding service continues to drive Charter's firm operating and financial momentum. That momentum continues to improve as we use our high-capacity infrastructure to grow each of our product lines. Looking forward, we intend to apply that same customer focus operating strategy on Time Warner Cable and Bright House assets as soon as we close our transactions.","We had a very strong third quarter both in terms of our customer growth, which accelerated year-over-year and our financial performance. We grew our residential customers by 97,000 versus 68,000 during the same period last year. And over the last 12 months, we've grown our residential customer base by a full 5%.","Our commercial customer growth driven by a small business activity also is accelerating with 14% growth year-over-year. In residential, we had 180,000 residential primary service units, about 60% more than we had last year. Commercial PSUs also improved to 31,000 net adds versus 5,000 last year.","We drove improved unit growth in each product in both residential and commercial. We added 12,000 residential video customers versus the loss of 9,000 last year. And we continue to grow expanded basic video relationship penetration now at 97%. And our commercial video customers grew by 4,000 customers. That performance reflects the significant improvements we've made to our video product following the all digital transition including quality digital pictures, more high-definition satellite and video-on-demand and interactive guide functionality on every television outlet in the home. Our goal remains to grow video customers for the full-year 2015.","Residential broadband also continues to improve, we gained 131,000 customers versus 94,000 during the third quarter of 2014. The service we also improved by going all-digital, by dedicating more network capacity to broadband. And we also add 37,000 residential voice customers.","We grew total revenue by 7.2% versus 8% in the same period last year. Excluding advertising, however, we grew revenue by 7.9% versus 7.7% last year. An 8.5% EBITDA growth, was higher than our revenue growth. Excluding transition-related costs, our EBITDA grew by 9.7% year-over-year. And our operating strategy, which remains focused on high-quality customer transactions using our skilled U.S.-based labor force, is causing our EBITDA to grow faster than our revenue.","A brief update on our proposed transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. In September, both Charter and Time Warner Cable received overwhelming approval from our respective shareholders for our proposed transactions. The FCC comment cycle will close mid-November, and we're working closely with the FCC and the Department of Justice to make sure that they have all the information they need to evaluate the merits of the transactions.","We've already received approval or authorization from most states. Most have obtained approvals approaching the threshold closing conditions for franchise authorities proving transactions. And we've raised nearly all the acquisition financing, and we will be operationally ready to close and we would like to close by year-end. But realistically, we think we're looking at a first quarter close.","We are establishing our leadership teams for New Charter; earlier this month, we announced that Phil Meeks who is currently at Time Warner Cable, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Business Services has joined New Charter as Executive Vice President and President of our Business Enterprise Services Group upon completion of our transaction with TWC. David Kline, formerly of Visible World has joined Charter as Executive Vice President, President of Media Sales, and will oversee all aspects of Charter's advertising business.","Given that New Charter will have a workforce of approximately 110,000 employees after we hire 20,000 more U.S. based people, Paul Marchand, formerly of PepsiCo has joined Charter as our new EVP of human resources. We're also making decisions about how departments, groups, and our employee structure will be organized in determining the location of management functions. From an operational perspective, we're developing plans for people, processes and system integration, continue all-digital, new pricing and packaging, Spectrum Guide and World Box roll-out, at both TWC and Bright House closing.","Integration planning and investments we made in 2014 and earlier this year provide a good start, should accelerate the integration of the new transactions. We're looking forward to close and to pursuing the many opportunities, great value that the New Charter will offer.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris Winfrey.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom, and starting with slide 6 of today's presentation, during the third quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 180,000. Then in video, we added 12,000 residential customers. Excluding both video customers, we added 11,000 compared to a loss of 29,000 last year. So, a strong improvement year-over-year and, as Tom mentioned, we continue to expect video customer net adds for the full year.","Residential Internet, we added 131,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 37,000 customers. Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 290,000 or by 5%. Over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 2.3%, driven by a larger triple play base and step-ups partially offset by continued single play Internet growth.","Slide 8 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 7.3% compared to 6.7% last year. In commercial, we added 31,000 PSUs versus 5,000 in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging to the small and medium business segment the first quarter of this year. Commercial revenue grew by approximately 13%, a bit less than last quarter, which reflects the same short-term ARPU trends we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging for residential in the middle of 2012.","Our advertising revenue was down about 12% year-over-year, given $8 million of political advertising last year. And, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had about $18 million of political revenue. In total, our third quarter revenue was up by 7.2% year-over-year, with a lower level of annual rate increases and most of the revenue increase coming from customer growth.","Turning to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 9, the total OpEx grew by $96 million or 6.5% year-over-year, of which, transition OpEx related to our M&A transactions accounted for about $12 million this quarter. Excluding those transition costs, total expenses grew by 5.8% year-over-year and programming expense grew by $46 million, accounting for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 7.4% increase in programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers and broader carriage (9:51) into the launch of new channels.","Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operating cost rose 1.9% year-over-year, despite residential customer relationship growth of 5%, as we continue to see a significant reduction in service transaction volumes.","Other costs grew by $29 million or about 14% year-over-year and that's driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, including the insourcing of IT and software development resources, as well as property taxes on previous CapEx and insurance on a larger service employee base. We also had higher bad debt as well as higher labor costs to support commercial growth. Excluding transition-related expenses, third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.7% year-over-year.","Moving to slide 11, third quarter capital expenditures totaled $509 million, with $24 million related to M&A transactions. As a reminder, that transition capital is being spent on items like our next-generation gateway, provisioning and service layer, our biller isolation layer and a new data warehouse, each for multiple legacy billing and provisioning platforms in the new company. Those platform investments really began with Comcast transactions and it provided us a head start here to provide a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers as quickly as possible post-closing.","The year-over-year decline in total CapEx was driven by the completion of all-digital during the fourth quarter of last year. And if you exclude all-digital last year and transition CapEx this year, our CapEx was up by just over $30 million or 7%, driven primarily by our investments in video product development and timing. We continue to expect approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures in 2015, excluding spending related to acquisitions.","Looking at adjusted EBITDA with CapEx at the top of slide 12, the increased contribution in cash flow was about $127 million and is $32 million higher if you exclude transition and adjusted EBITDA and CapEx, respectively. Free cash flow also improved year-over-year, with EBITDA up, CapEx down and a positive working capital contribution, offset by transaction and transition costs.","While the third quarter cash interest paid on our $19.3 billion of escrowed debt is modest, we would expect the net cash interest impact of that debt to be approximately $125 million in the fourth quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, our current leverage ratio is 4.2 times on an LTM basis, set at the lower end of our target leverage range of 4 and 4.5 times.","In July and August, we completed $19.3 billion of financings for our transactions with TWC and Bright House. These financings, combined with our additional term loan aid commitments of $2 billion, totaled about 90% of the debt financing needed at closing. The remaining $2.5 billion need represents less than 5% of the pro-forma entities' debt and will be opportunistic. While our $3 billion revolver closes it is really intended to be unfunded, we could use it to finance a portion of the remaining amount.","So make a $100 cash election option for TWC shareholders, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5 times at close of stakes on 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and including $500 million assumed year one synergies. Similar to Charter today, we'll be in a position to mechanically delever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. And our target leverage from New Charter will remain 4 to 4.5 times and work to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range, and we're committed to maintaining an investment grade index rating at a secured level but first-lien leverage under 3.5 times.","To the extent that the $115 cash election were elected by TWC shareholders, we do have this $4.5 billion high yield bridge that's in place to cover our needs if that were the case. So we're really comfortable and pleased with where we are with respect to our balance sheet and the financing of the transactions.","Turning to slide 13, Charter has large tax assets which will offer even more value than New Charter. In the fourth quarter, we liquidated one of our tax partnerships and that liquidation resulted in a net step up of our tax basis of approximately $650 million, driving even more tax asset value. That partnership liquidation also provided a onetime benefit to GAAP tax expense of $169 million in the P&L and was a key driver to the positive net income that we have in the fourth quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I wanted to make a few comments about some customer and financial reporting changes that will make, that we will implement next quarter. Those changes are described on slide 14 of today's presentation, and we've also provided supplementary pages in today's trending schedule and the presentation to show what these changes will look like along with the corollary footnotes.","The changes really do three key things. One, they change our residential video customer counts to a \"doors\" methodology. Two, they separate SMB customers and revenue from enterprise to reflect our recent organizational changes in commercial. And three, they show SMB video PSUs based on contractual relationships instead of an EBU methodology.","Obviously no change to overall financials and all the customer (15:25), revenue and EBITDA trends that you'll see under the new methodology are very similar to the trends that you see under the methodology we've been using. However, the change will better reflect how we're managing the business today. And they set us up for more consistent reporting among TWC, Bright House and Charter at closing.","So, in the fourth quarter, we'll report using this new methodology and we'll still provide our fourth quarter results under the old methodology to provide transparency and also just people planning to update their models this quarter.","Operator, we are ready for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions. Tom, last quarter you talked about an evolution of your thinking on video bundling. And I wondered if you could update us on how you're thinking about that today? There's been some press coverage that you guys are looking at a streaming package. I wonder if you could maybe address that and just any update on that front would be helpful.","And then just for Chris, I'll ask my second question. If you look at the other expense growth which has been in the teens this year, is there a way for us to think about maybe residential versus commercial? Because you would seemingly be showing even more operating leverage than you already are, if that business was maybe more reflecting the residential trend. Any color you can give us there would be helpful.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Ben. In terms of what we're actually selling in the marketplace, we have a very rich video package that includes a two-way interactive platform on every outlet. And the vast majority of our customers, 97%, are taking a complete full basic \u2013 expanded basic product, and we're packaging that with high-speed data and with voice in a compelling price point. And we're doing it with a quality service organization that drives the customer relationship in a positive direction and extends the life of the average customer. So, that's our basic marketing strategy.","There is an issue in video obviously if you look at the total quantity of video growth in the whole marketplace, it's down slightly, and the reason is the cost of the product relative to what people incomes have done, is creating a mismatch \u2013 I mean it's an elasticity of demand problem essentially. The curve has shifted because income growth is down for the vast majority of the population. The population is poor essentially. More people are \u2013 have left the workforce. More people are on disability and on food stamps and that affects what people are willing to pay for it.","For content, we try to make the content valuable in the way we make the product work and the fully featured service implications of the product. So, there's also effective service issue essentially in that a lot of the TV Everywhere product and other product available online is not secured well. You have people joking about sharing passwords on authentication on Emmy award shows. That's a real issue and so, that expects elasticity to demand as does the overall income level of the population.","We're finding success though with the price we're selling and driving to the market. We test occasionally new products, and we test price points. And some of the stories you've read about what we're doing are \u2013 those are a result of tests. We don't have any of those kind of numbers in these results. And we do that from time to time.","In terms of streaming, we sell cable television services using IP technology and MPEG technology. And people call over the top streaming and they call IP streaming, and what we're selling is cable television in applications. And we have 1.4 million customers who have downloaded our apps and used those apps to receive cable television on their iOS platforms, their Android platforms and now on their Roku platform. So, we continue to expand the platforms that the app system is available, but it's cable television.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Then on the other expense, the way that I characterized it in the prepared remarks really gives you a sense of the materiality. So, starting from the first and largest corporate administrative labor expense that I mentioned really has been driven by IT advanced engineering and software development as we've in-sourced a lot of those functions. That provides benefit to all parts of the house, in residential, SMB and enterprise. So, it's kind of hard to allocate a portion of those.","The second category was the property taxes on previous CapEx and insurance on the larger service employee base. I see that also is tied to the insourcing that we are doing as we have more in-house labor, things like casualty insurance and previous CapEx property tax. You could get into a discussion on how to allocate that and we probably could but for consistency we've left that in other, but you could think about it pro rata relative to the customer base.","And then the last one, there is a higher bad debt that comes along with increasing revenue in all three of those areas in residential, SMB and enterprise. So, again you can think about that per revenue (21:58) is really the least of all of those that I described was in the commercial space.","Now, when we go forward, what you'll see in the some of the reporting methodology that I outlined on a go-forward basis starting in Q4, we will \u2013 because the business is managing residential and SMB together, you'll see the operating expenses other than corporate at the IT that I described, and other than the casualty insurance, you'll see some of the expenses for SMB, will be the cable operation cost to serve. And what will remain in the other expense here will be predominantly as it relates to commercial, will be enterprises as opposed to SMB. So, you'll start to have a little bit more clarity, and that's really to reflect how we're managing the business internally as well.","So, it's a bit nuanced, but if you take a look at the P&Ls that we provided, the reclassification of expenditure, you'll see some of that taking place in these trending schedules.","Again, there's no change to our reporting this quarter. It's only that we've shown you in advance what it's going to look like next quarter. We've done a recasting all the way back so people can adjust their models.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.","Jeffrey D. Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Good morning, guys. Between you all and Time Warner Cable today, it appears you're seeing a particularly nice share shift from your competition. Can you provide more color on the competitive environment? How they're responding to your success? And any trends you can give us on the fourth quarter would be helpful.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Time Warner's PSU growth is good and accelerating and we're happy to see that, as is Charter's. We invested heavily in our network to make our products superior to our competitors. We've invested heavily in our service organization to differentiate our service from our competitors. And that is affecting our ability to grow. And our growth is accelerating. And all the capital we put into our plant and all of the hiring we did and the training and the acquisition of test equipment, trucks, tools, all of those things are paying off with better service and better products, which have an effect in the marketplace, which you're seeing.","Jeffrey D. Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And the competitive response to that?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think that the competitors continue to aggressively promote their products at low price points. And we think that fundamentally, we have better products than they do.","Jeffrey D. Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Fair enough. And one for Chris, can you provide more color on the slowdown in programming expense in the third quarter? Is there anything one-off there and the outlook for the fourth quarter?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. There was nothing one-off inside the third quarter as it related to programming. As I mentioned on the last call, we did have a large one-off in the second quarter of 2014, which caused the growth rate in Q2 of this year to be elevated, so the percentage growth rate to be elevated in Q2. This one is a normal quarter and also reflects the addition of some more significant content at the beginning of June through last year. So, we don't usually get into the mode of providing forward-looking guidance, but the rate that you saw is at in Q3 is a good run rate from where we are today.","Jeffrey D. Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. So, two quick questions, first, we've just gone through the back-to-school season, just wondering if you could comment on what you've seen as far as video take rates this year in your college markets as compared to last year, or the past couple of years. And then separately, I just wanted to ask if you would comment on whether or not you might participate in some way in the upcoming broadcast incentive auctions. Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we continue to see opportunity in the college market, and we have improved our ability to sell there. And so, our year-over-year performance has improved. There's continued purchasing of data only in that marketplace, and we've approached the market with a variety of tactics. But fundamentally, a lot of college kids are using their authentication from their parents in getting cable TV services for free, and that was the issue I was talking about previously.","The lack of control over the content by content companies and authentication processes has reduced the demand for video because you don't have to pay for it. And that's going on in the college market. But because of our sales techniques, we're actually growing. But there is a trend there that is negative associated with lack of authentication processes.","With regard to the auction, we're studying the auction. We're interested in it. And I talked extensively in the past about the opportunities in being a mobile business, and there are a variety of ways to go into it. We're in a very awkward situation given the pendency of our deal to be able to participate in that, but we are exploring it.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bryan. Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions, one, Chris, can you talk some more about your expectations for longer-term capital intensity and what you've learned, and particularly as we think about the rollout of the active video platform and the user interface? And then if you could just update one quick clarification on what you just said about the auction, would you consider participating in the auction with Comcast if that were an opportunity or would your participation necessarily be entirely independent?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the longer-term capital intensity, unfortunately, we haven't left much to guess for people in terms of what we think because we're required to disclose our internal forecast as part of the shareholder vote proxy process. Our opinion of what happens to the financial development of the company has not changed, and we think that the business becomes a lot less capital-intensive over time, particularly once you get behind all-digital in the Time Warner Cable and Bright House properties.","A little bit tied into the second part of that question that you asked me was that one of the other major benefits that comes out of this is not only getting all-digital behind you and having your capital be applied to net additions as opposed to gross adds, but it also means that you can take all of the cloud-based infrastructure development that Charter is doing today and that Time Warner Cable is doing today and that Bright House is doing today, and do it once and be in a position to, on the increment, be able to grow more efficiently from a fixed overhead capital development and infrastructure perspective. And that is one of the benefits that scale brings.","And that ties into your question about Spectrum Guide and World Box lessons. We're, as Tom mentioned, rolling out into St. Louis and into Reno imminently. And it requires some up front development, which we've already spent, and it requires some up front expenditure at the local level which you're seeing inside of our capital expenditure today.","But once you get beyond that market-by-market, your unit cost is dramatically lower on the CPE. And the functionality of the box is dramatically higher for World Box when that's deployed, which means that you have longer life to assets on longer-lived customers which significantly improves the ROI over time. And that's what you, in essence, see in front of the forecast that we needed to disclose as part of the proxy statement.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And with regard, Craig, to the auction, we're not working with anyone -- at the moment. We're considering \u2013 but we have \u2013 for us to participate, we have big questions about how to \u2013 how to finance it and what are actual footprint would be if we were to bid in. So, we don't know the answers to those questions, but we are thinking about that auction and what to do about it.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","All right. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Tom, you mentioned about deploying your pricing promotion strategies across Time Warner Cable's footprint on the closing of the transaction. They seem to be following your pricing in some ways already, but in terms of the hardware strategy, I don't think you guys talked about modems and also charge much less for set-top box rentals. Is that something that you are going to move to the Charter pricing scheme for that? And second, if there could be any color on the path of rolling out Spectrum Guide. How many homes can we expect in the next year and so forth, and is there scaling on your trials? Thanks so much.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, with regard to our box price strategy and our modem price strategy are where our pricing strategy is. As we think through how the price Time Warner, Bright House assets in the future, we would tend to go toward our pricing model. How we transition that is going to be an art, but we think it can be done, and that we can ultimately grow up the business by changing the pricing model toward ours and changing the number of boxes that are actually deployed.","One of the functions \u2013 one of the things that occurs in the Time Warner assets as a result of the box prices is that there's a lot more one-way boxes out there because of disparity in price between the boxes, interactive boxes and the one-way boxes. And we believe that every outlet should have two-way interactive box on it, because it utilizes the full capacity of the network, and therefore, the product is improved on every TV that's in the house. In order to do that, you got to drive boxes deeper into the marketplace, and so you can't overprice them in our view. And so, we're going to do that.","With regard to the Guide rollout, we're a few weeks, six weeks probably behind our schedule than \u2013 in rollout as we work through all the software issues, but we are rolling out the product. We have said we thought we could do as many as 1.6 million this year. I don't think that's probably realistic or desirable at this point given where we're starting.","Initially, we're going to roll out in Reno and in St. Louis. How we roll that out going forward, we haven't yet budgeted. But our plan is to roll it out as rapidly as we can operationalize it and get the benefit of it. We have some things to learn yet about operationalizing it. And so, I don't \u2013 we'll do it as quickly as we can but we don't have a budgeted schedule yet for 2016.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take on our next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Amy Yong from Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. There's been a lot of focus and attention on LTs and their synergy and margin targets for Cablevision which would obviously imply there's a long way for improvement for Charter and Time Warner Cable. I just want to know if there are any thoughts on kind of what the margin potential would be and some of the operational efficiencies that you can talk through? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Amy. In regard our thoughts around the U.S. cable business and what we're able to do in a growth model, which we think drives the most value for shareholders. Again, it's reflected in a lot of these internal forecasts. If Charter was \u2013 had a higher penetration, which we intend to be our margin would be higher. And we intend for that to take place and you can see that inside of the forecast. Our synergy numbers were designed to be conservative primarily because we were focused on getting the revenue engine going and then not disrupting the workforce in fact to in-source more labor back to the U.S., so that we can provide a higher quality service and grow faster.","If we wanted to take an alternative strategy into one time increase our margin percent at the expense of revenue growth, I certainly think there's huge opportunities go do that, it's just not our view of how we want to create value. And we're focused on dollars of EBITDA growth and cash flow growth as opposed to just focusing laterally on the percentage margin. It doesn't mean that you can't have both, it means you can. And that's what the operating model and the growth strategy that we're doing is designed to do it and that's why it works well in acquisitions when you can deploy that operating strategy on a larger set of assets to go create the same set of value.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Something I'll add to that is fundamentally our strategy is to improve our return on investment. And that means that we're looking at the capital we're spending and the kind of operating income that we're creating over time, but ultimately, the free cash flow that we're creating, and that's how we drive the business. So, when we look at opportunity in front of us we try to create as much value over time as we can, without regard to the short term marginal opportunities that might exist.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The only final thing I'd add on to that is there's something interesting to learn along the way. I'm not going to be pig headed or certainly take a look and we'll try to mirror the same \u2013 something coming out of Europe. I spent 10 years in European Cable so I have an appreciation for some of the margins that were feasible in another marketplace. But there's something that could be applied I used to do when I was running at above 50% margin that can be applied here, then we would certainly piggyback on that. It would represent upside for all of them.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Of course.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If we can learn how to do this, we certainly will.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. Two quick questions, if I may. As you sort of look at the wireless opportunity, how do you weigh going with an asset-light model like some of the Liberty Global properties have in Europe versus needing to put assets underneath the model, buying spectrum, and other assets like that?","And then separately on the enterprise side, it seems like growth has slowed more for you guys than it has for some of the other cable companies. Is it because you're more penetrated in enterprise than others or is the opportunity in your footprint less than it is in others or do you think that you should be able to accelerate that growth rate from here?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, with regard to wireless, I think I talked in the past about all of the opportunities that exist there and as you approach that business, I think there are different time frames in terms of what your model might be over time, I should say. So it's a complex question, and I don't have an answer for it yet because we haven't gone into the business. But as we do, I think there are a multiple ways of coming at it. But in the long run, you want to do the thing that produces the highest return on investment, which is what we were talking about a moment ago.","With regard to enterprise, if you look at our unit growth in the small business section, it's going, it's accelerating. So, why is the revenue growth decelerating from a growth rate perspective? Part of that is because we've repositioned the business to grow faster, just like we did the residential business four years ago.","And as a result of doing that, we're actually pricing down some product so that we can grow faster. And as we do that, there is a lag in growth that will be covered up with the growth rate of units in the future. And our view is that we will have a higher outcome than we would if we continued on the current pricing model. So, that's essentially what's going on there.","With regard to the large segment, some of the segments have slowed like cell tower growth, but the opportunity there is tremendous. Our penetration at the enterprise level is less than 10%. And so, there is tremendous upside, and there is a tremendous upside to expand our footprint there, which is not fully expanded. We've committed, as part of this acquisition, to extend the footprint of our serviceable enterprise area as a result of that. And we think that we can grow the business and improve the products and create new products that don't exist today. So, we're very bullish on the future of enterprise, and we think that what's going on today short term is just a repositioning in the marketplace.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Will Milner with Arete Research.","Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP","Thanks a lot. I just had one question. I just want to ask a question in relation to the $2 billion TWC break fee. I mean, presumably the right way to think about this is that you'd be willing to contemplate concessions up to that value. And in that light, I just wonder, are there any particular concessions around TWC that you deem to be deal breakers? And specifically, I'm thinking about wholesale access to your broadband network, if you could give some thoughts on that, that'd be helpful.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't really think it's a good thing to be discussing the break fee. Our opportunity with this deal is to grow the total business and to improve the total business and to create a more competitive business across all of the assets. And so, we haven't had any discussions with the FCC regarding any conditions. And so, I don't really want to discuss them in this place.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Will.","Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP","Fair enough. Thanks.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two. The first is on usage-based pricing. I know you don't implement this today, but how are you comfortable that you're not going to need or want usage-based pricing as the ecosystem evolves over the next couple of years?","And then the second question is with regards to your conversations with the regulators, is Bright House included in these? Is it Time Warner Cable only? Does Bright House come in separate?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's one transaction from a regulatory point of view. So, Bright House and Time Warner and Charter are all included. With regard to usage-based pricing, we don't do it. We don't do it because we want to sell more services, and that's our business model.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And you don't see for that to change at any point?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't have any plans to change it.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Marci. We'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Tom, I guess just drilling back into this depth of service issue. I guess having grown up in a cable executive's household that fought pirated set-top boxes and the like back in the day, this seems like it's even worse and particularly more pervasive on the premium content side. Just your thoughts on why the industry is not being more proactive in addressing it? It seems like there's just a lot of complacency out there. And as we move into a limited streaming environment of three to four streams, it seems like that the overall audience still is going to be shrinking over time. Just your thoughts around that?","And then, if I may, Chris, the higher bad debt level, is there any connection there with any sort of uptick in involuntary churn? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I've spoken to a lot of the programming providers. In fact, at a core level, it's \u2013 they haven't been in that business before, and they haven't really thought through what they're doing. And so, now they're sending their signal out themselves. And they have \u2013 they don't seem to have thought through what the implications of that are. And they've created a problem where they devalued their own product by their inability to secure it.","And it's a real issue. And it does affect the overall value. Now, it's a hassle (45:09). There are issues with the way the service is delivered. And if you had a reasonable amount of income and you had an 80 inch TV, the cable packets for most people still makes a lot of sense, but it is devaluing the product by not managing it.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I guess the younger generation level in the poll testing that we do, back to your point, there's just a tremendous amount of password churn particularly in those premium apps.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And so, there's a complete lack of control and understanding in that space.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","I agree.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the higher bad debt levels, no we're not seeing an increase in non-pay churn. What we're seeing is a growing customer base. We also made some minor changes to our collection policies in the fourth quarter of 2014 that just technically causes an expansion of that that will be wrapped inside of Q4. So, there is no issue of non-pay. Overall, our total churn is coming down and we're pleased with where we're at.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","The last question is from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. Just to dig into commercial a little bit. It sounds like part of the slowdown was just, slower issuing customers and more on intro plans. Is there going to be a need to reprice the back book there at all, and how \u2013 what sort of impact should we expect that to have?","And secondly, on video and looking at \u2013 I know that there are a lot of issues around video ARPU numbers due to bundling, but can you give us an idea of what you think is really happening with video profitability in terms of customer's willingness to pay for services versus the what the content is actually costing and if that delta is actually compressing, how do you think about the trade-off between more video subs potentially lower profitably versus higher profitability but lower subs? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. On the commercial side and similar to what we said with residential, we did pricing and packaging, there will be a transition of the base over time, but you've got to do it in a way that it doesn't have a negative pull on the business. We've successfully managed through that on the residential side and we'll take the same approach with the SMB portion of commercial which is where we pulled out the pricing and packaging. So, yes, there are puts and takes along the way, but we're seeing that already and we'll manage it in a similar way that has already been done for residential.","And video profitability, we don't \u2013 because of what we sell, we sell triple play and our strategy is about growing customer relationships, growing revenue per household. And as a result, actually increasing our margin through, and our ROI, through having a better penetration and revenue-base on what is essentially a fixed set of assets and operating cost.","So, we don't try to piece apart and say look at one particular segment or a product of what we're selling because we sell an entire package into the household and it would lead you to bad conclusions. In any event, we think video remains a profitable business. It's a core part of our strategy. It's what we sell together with Internet and phone. And what we're selling is profitable, and that's what really matters versus opposed to trying to divvy it up and decide who gets the certain amount of network operating cost. It's somewhat arbitrary and it's not what we sell. So, we don't look at it that way.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, James.

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Rutledge","Thanks, Stefan. We performed well in 2018, while simultaneously completing the most customer impacting phase of our integration. For the full year, we grew our total Internet customer base by 1.3 million customers, or 5.3%. We grew cable revenue by 4.7% in 2018 and cable adjusted EBITDA by 6.5%. With our integration now nearly complete, our goal is to accelerate customer relationship and cash flow growth going forward. Following our transactions in May of 2016, we put three very large companies together in order to create a new company with a larger and more concentrated footprint, giving us the scale to innovate and grow faster. We're beginning to benefit from that strategy in all the ways we expected. When we started the process of pursuing additional scale in 2013, we knew that to fully benefit from any acquisitions we would need to create a single operating entity with a unified product, marketing, technology and service infrastructure. We spent over two-and-a-half years doing that.","Slide four of today's presentation reflects the progress against the integration plan we first showed in 2016 and the earlier-than-expected launches of DOCSIS 3.1 1-gig service and Spectrum Mobile. While our integration and network upgrades have excellent long-term benefits, they've been disruptive to our customers, our ability to execute and counter to our long-term operating strategy of reducing service interactions as planned. That process though is now essentially complete. But we still have some work to do, but virtually all of the customer-facing initiatives related to our integration are now behind us. We've migrated 70% of our acquired residential customers to Spectrum pricing and packaging. Our all-digital initiative is now finished. We've completed the upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1 and the launch of our gigabit speed offering across our entire residential and business footprint.","Our service infrastructure is national, specialized and consistent. Our call centers and service platforms will be fully virtualized across the company by year-end and our field operation and customer care in-sourcing are also nearly complete. By the end of 2019, we expect to have completed the very last pieces of our integration. But as I said most of this year's integration activity is noncustomer facing in nature. With our biggest integration initiatives behind us, we're now in a position to drive long-term sustainable customer relationship growth, EBITDA growth and significantly lower capital intensity driving accelerating free cash flow growth.","As we look forward to 2019 -- through 2019, we remain focused on a number of key strategic priorities including driving higher sales volumes. We made some key changes to our double and triple play packaging in September including the way we sell landline voice and including Spectrum Mobile in every sales opportunity. Those changes required that we retrain our sales force personnel in all sales channels. That process took through October to take hold and our sales effectiveness will continue to improve. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that churn continues to show meaningful improvements as planned.","Spectrum Mobile is ramping up. We added over 110,000 mobile lines in the fourth quarter and we're seeing a growing percentage of our new cable sales taking mobile service. We're also upselling mobile service to existing cable customers.","Over the longer term, we expect consumer savings from our mobile offering to drive incremental cable sales as we build brand and product awareness for our Spectrum Mobile service and become a more powerful retention tool.","In December, we began the process of allowing customers to transfer their existing handsets to the Spectrum Mobile from other service providers at some of our stores. Over the coming months we'll expand the Bring Your Own Device program to include a broader set of devices and to allow customers to bring their own device process -- to do their own -- Bring Your Own Device process themselves without having to visit us in a store. Full Bring Your Own Device availability will expand our mobile market opportunity substantially.","In 2019 we are also well-positioned to reduce service transactions. With the vast majority of our integration behind us, we expect to see a meaningful reduction in network activity, CPE swamps, service calls and truck rolls. Service activity should also decline as our better product and pricing and services across a larger base improves. And as we begin to benefit from enhanced online self-service greater levels of self installs. So in 2019, the lower level of activity will raise customer satisfaction, reduce churn and extend customer lifetimes.","Finally in 2019 is the year we\u2019ll see a significant reduction in capital intensity. Our goal at the beginning of this process was to put our combined assets in a position to operate as a single entity and to grow faster over the long-term as quickly as possible. As a result, we stepped up capital spending in the short-term. That higher spending is now behind us and cable capital intensity will fall significantly in 2019 as planned, but also beyond 2019 as CPE spend per home declines, consumers increasingly install their own services, the reliability of our plant improves and our network becomes increasingly cloud based and IT driven, all on higher expected revenue, while we continue to appropriately invest in our products and in our network.","Already in 2019, I expect the business and cash flow performance of our cable business will further demonstrate the superiority of our networks and our assets, the returns of our recent investment and the long-term benefits of our consumer-focused operating strategy on a larger set of assets.","I'll turn the call over to Chris Winfrey. ","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. A couple of administrative items before covering our results. Like last quarter, the prospective adoption of the new revenue recognition standard lowered our EBITDA in the fourth quarter by about $7 million as compared to last year. In 2019, there should be a less impact year-over-year and we don't expect to continue to highlight the amount. And as it relates to Hurricane Michael in Florence and the wildfires in California, we did have some recovery and rebuild cost in the quarter, but they were relatively small. And since we had storms in last year's fourth quarter, the negative impact of this quarter's EBITDA and CapEx on a year-over-year basis was minimal.","Now turning to our results. Total residential and SMB customer relationships grew by 248,000 in the fourth quarter and 942,000 over the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, Internet grew by 329,000 in the quarter. Video declined by 22,000 and voice declined by 56,000. Over 70% of our acquired residential customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the fourth quarter. And similar to what we saw at Legacy Charter, pricing and packaging migration transactions are slowing, which together with the completion of network upgrades last year means that in 2019 we\u2019ll see lower CPE spending and meaningful churn benefits.","For residential Internet, we added a total of 289.000 customers versus 263,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our total residential Internet customer base by 1.1 million customers or 4.9%. And we now offer Gigabit service to nearly 100% of our footprint using DOCSIS 3.1. Over the last year, our residential video customers declined by 1.8%. Sales of our Stream and Choice packages which are primarily targeted at Internet-only has continued to do well. Spectrum Guide is being deployed to the vast majority of new video connects, providing a better overall video experience. And our video product is available via the Spectrum TV app on a variety of platforms, including Android, Kindle Fire, Roku, Xbox, Samsung Smart TV and computers. We also recently launched our Spectrum TV app on Apple TV with a Zero Sign-On feature for customers for Spectrum Internet.","In voice, we lost 83,000 residential voice customers in the quarter versus a gain of 23,000 last year, driven by a lower triple-play selling mix. As Tom mentioned, we changed our voice pricing in mid-September to address wireline voice sell-in, retention at roll-off and the launch of mobile. At acquisition, voice is now $9.99 with no change to that price when a customer rolls off a bundled promotion. With wireline voice as a $9.99 value-added service going forward, mobile is now positioned to be the triple play value driver for connectivity sales, similar to what wireline voice did for cable over the last decade. These are meaningful changes to a large selling machine, but the transition went well in the fourth quarter.","Turning to mobile. We added 113,000 mobile lines in the quarter with a healthy mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines. As of December we had 134,000 lines. As we add new features and functionality including Bring Your Own Device capabilities, we expanded our marketable population as Tom mentioned. Over the last year we grew total residential customers by 771,000 or 3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 0.9% year-over-year given the lower rate of SVP migration and promotional campaign roll-off and rate adjustments. And we did grow subs in voice and video taxes in both revenue and expense with no impact to EBITDA in the past or now. Those ARPU benefits were partially offset by higher mix of Internet-only customers.","Slide seven shows our cable customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 3.9%. Keep in mind that our cable ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue.","Turning to commercial. Total SMB and enterprise revenue combined grew by 4.5% in the fourth quarter. SMB revenue grew by 3.6% faster than last quarter as the revenue growth impacted re-pricing our SMB products in Legacy TWC and Bright House have slowed. We've grown SMB customer relationships by over 10% in the last year. Into 2019, we expect a lower level of SMB ARPU decline for the repricing. Enterprise revenue was up by 5.7%. Excluding cell backhaul Navisite and some one-time fees, which were a benefit this quarter, enterprise grew by 6% with 13% PSU growth year-over-year. Our enterprise group is in an earlier stage of a pricing impact due to transition but it\u2019s very similar to what we have done in our larger SMB and residential businesses over the last two years.","The process of moving customers to more competitive pricing, pressures enterprise ARPU in the near-term. But ultimately the revenue growth will follow the unit growth as its beginning to happen in and SMB. We remain very confident in the strategy in our long-term growth opportunity in enterprise. Fourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 34% year-over-year and political advertising accounted for all of that growth as it also utilizes traditional inventory. Mobile revenue totaled $89 million with about $80 million of that revenue being device revenue. As a reminder, under equipment installment plans or EIP all future device installment payments are recognized as revenue on the connect date. Hence, the mobile working usage during the growth phase, which we highlighted. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 5.9% year-over-year with cable revenue growth of 5.1% or 3.9% when excluding advertising.","So, moving to operating expenses on slide eight. In the fourth quarter total operating expenses grew by $446 million or 6.7% year-over-year. Excluding mobile, operating expenses increased by 3.6%. Programming increased 5.5% year-over-year and a mid-single-digit growth rate is probably a good baseline for 2019 programming costs growth. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 11.8% driven by our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, which re-classed some expenses to this line in the quarter as well as the voice and video tax and fee gross that I mentioned earlier.","And finally, content costs were up given more Lakers games in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Cost of service customers declined by 0.8% year-over-year compared to 3.5% customer relationship growth. And even excluding some bad debt improvement year-over-year, cost to service customers was flat year-over-year. We are essentially lowering our per-relationship service costs through changes in business practices and continue to see productivity benefits from in-sourcing investments.","Cable and marketing expenses declined by 2.3% year-over-year and other cable expenses were up 7% year-over-year, driven by higher ad sales cost for political IT cost from ongoing integration, property tax and insurance and costs related to the launch of our Spectrum News 1 channel in Los Angeles. Mobile expenses totaled $211 million and was comprised of device cost tied to the device revenue I mentioned, market launch costs and operating expenses to stand up and operate the business, including our own personnel and overhead costs in our portion of the JV with Comcast.","Adjusted cable EBITDA grew by 7.6% in the fourth quarter. And when including the mobile EBITDA loss of $122 million, total adjusted EBITDA grew by 4.6%. As we look to 2019, annualizing our fourth quarter 2018 mobile EBITDA loss is a good starting place for estimating our 2019 mobile EBITDA loss. That generalization assumes immaterial acceleration in mobile line growth which drives high acquisition costs as well as our own growing start-up costs. As mobile lines and revenue scale relative to the fixed operating cost and variable acquisition costs, we continue to expect mobile will be positive EBITDA and cash flow business on a stand-alone basis without accounting for the planned benefits to cable.","Turning to net income on slide 9, we generated $296 million of net income attributable to Charter's shareholders in the fourth quarter versus $9.6 billion last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by last year's GAAP tax benefit given the federal tax reform, higher interest expense and pension derivative and other non-cash adjustments in this year's fourth quarter. That was partly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization expense.","Turning to slide 10 on CapEx. Capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter; about $150 million lower than last year. The decline was primarily driven by a lower CPE with less SPP migration and as we finished all-digital. We also had lower scalable infrastructure and support capital spend, given more consistent timing of in-year spend this year versus last, as well as the completion of various integration projects. That was partly offset by higher spend on line extensions as we continue to build out and fulfill our merger conditions. We spent $106 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, driven by software, some of which is related to our JV with Comcast and on upgrading our retail footprint for mobile. Most of the mobile spend is reflected in support capital. Following what I mentioned earlier, using the Q4 mobile CapEx run rate is a simple way to think about 2019 also works. We expect mobile CapEx will decline following the upgrade of our retail footprint.","For the full year 2018, we spent $8.9 billion in cable CapEx or 20.4% of cable revenue, down from 20.9% in 2017, consistent with our previous expectations. As we look to 2019, Tom mentioned, cable CapEx will be down meaningfully in absolute dollar terms and in terms of capital intensity. We don't generally provide guidance, but with a significant decline in 2019 capital spend, I will tell you our internal plan calls for $7 billion, roughly $7 billion of total cable CapEx in 2019, down from $8.9 billion in 2018 for all the reasons we've said. Within that number, there's still single product and network development and some integration capital including both software development and real estate improvements which we treat as CapEx. As usual, if we find new high ROI projects during the course of the year without accelerated spend on existing projects will drive faster growth we would continue to do so.","Slide 11 shows we generated $885 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, including about $300 million in investment in our team. Excluding mobile, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of cable free cash flow, roughly the same as last year's fourth quarter. While this quarter we did have higher adjusted EBITDA and lower cable CapEx year-over-year those were almost entirely offset by a lower cash flow benefit from working capital year-over-year. Recall that we spent a significant amount of capital in and linked within the fourth quarter of 2017. So we had a very large working capital benefit nearly $700 million within the fourth quarter of 2017.","Excluding the year-over-year working capital impacts, cable free cash flow was up by over $400 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2019, I expect another year of working capital related reduction to cash flow as we continue to add mobile customers, which drive headset-related working capital needs will continue to separate that. and as cable CapEx falls meaningfully already in the first quarter in 2019, which means we'll see an immediate and material full year step down in our cable CapEx payables balance, which could make our first quarter 2019 cable working capital look similar to the first quarter of 2018. The drivers for both of these working capital impacts are logical. And while over the longer term it's a question of timing both drivers will have outsized quarterly and full year impacts.","We finished the quarter with $72 billion in debt principal. Our run rate analyze cash interest at year-end was $3.9 billion versus our P&L interest expense in the quarter is adjusted $3.6 billion annual run rate. That difference is primarily due to purchase accounting. As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 4.45 times at the high end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. We intend to stay at\/or below 4.5 times leverage and we include the up-front investment in mobile to be more conservative when looking at cable-only leverage, which stands at 4.38 times and is declining.","At the end of the quarter, we held nearly $3.4 billion in liquidity from cash on hand and revolver capacity. And in January, we issued $3.7 billion in investment-grade bonds in bank debt as shown on slide 22 and we increased the size of our revolver, all of which will be used for general purposes, pending maturities and buybacks.","Pro forma for the repayment of our $3.25 billion of investment grade notes maturing in February and April, our weighted average cost of debt declines to 5.2%. Our weighted average life of debt is over 11 years. Over 90% of our debt matures beyond 2021 and over 80% of our debt will be fixed rate. So we have a prudent and unique capital structure. And consistent with how we regularly evaluate our leverage target, we don't currently expect to be material cash income taxpayer until 2021 at the earliest meaning $1 of EBITDA Charter is not the same as elsewhere from our leverage of free cash flow perspective.","We also had strong visibility on EBITDA growth and accelerating cash flow growth, meaning we can mechanically delever quickly if we see a permanent increase in refinancing cost, a change in business outlook or investment opportunities. During the quarter, we also repurchased 4.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $1.4 billion at an average price of $314 per share during the fourth quarter. In September -- and since September of 2016 we've repurchased about 19% of Charter's equity.","Briefly turning to our taxes on slide 13. Our tax assets are primarily composed of our NOL and our tax receivables arrangement at Bright House are worth over $3 billion. So we're looking forward to 2019, our customer revenue and EBITDA growth combined with decline in capital intensity and the tax assets will drive accelerating free cash flow growth. And we expect that free cash flow growth, combined with an innovative capital structure and reasonable leverage target and an ROI-based capital allocation to drive healthy levered equity returns.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin","Thank you. Chris, thanks for breaking with tradition and giving CapEx guidance. I think it's extremely helpful. Just two quick questions, if I may, on CapEx. During the prepared remarks you mentioned that CapEx declines would continue. Did you mean that CapEx will continue as sort of around this level for cable of around $7 billion? Or is there a path for it to move even lower than that in future years?","And then similarly on the cost side, you mentioned the reduction in activity now that you're at the \u2013 now that you've got most of the customer-facing integration efforts behind you. Should we think of non-programming costs being stable at these levels with all of that activity behind you? Or could non-programming costs in sort of aggregate dollar terms come down a little bit from here? Thank you. ","Tom Rutledge","So Jonathan, its Tom. On the CapEx guidance going forward, we do think that in general going forward beyond 2019 and beyond our guidance that capital intensity will come down. That's a function of revenue growth and continued opportunities to be more efficient with our capital spending. But I think the best way to think about it is that it really depends on how fast you're growing to some extent, and how fast the opportunities to become more efficient are, in terms of your customer service infrastructure. So I think that we'll leave it as we said, that it's generally getting more efficient because of the operating opportunities that the network configuration provides us, meaning cloud-based services, IP-based services, lower CPE. But connected to your other question about non-programming costs, we think that that will also be down materially going forward, as a result of our ability to self-service customers and our ability to provide a better customer service experience which will reduce transactions in general. That reduces capital and it reduces operating costs. So we actually think we end up in a world with higher margins and lower capital intensity.","Chris Winfrey","Just to add one thing to that, Jonathan, in case you're modeling it with respect to growth. The OpEx per customer relationship is going to come down materially, as Tom said. Depending on growth, if you're -- today we're growing customer relationships by 3.5%, I mean, our goal is to accelerate that customer relationship. So when we talk about the cost per, it's really in the context of cost per relationship and having a material decline. Given the fact that we had elevated bad debt last year and that's now behind us, I do think there's an opportunity to also reduce it on a gross basis but I think the key point here is tied to customer relationship growth and the cost per customer relationship is going to decline substantially this year.","Jonathan Chaplin","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question today will come from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. And just sticking with CapEx. Tom, could you talk a little bit about your vision for the video business, particularly as it relates to a sort of Bring Your Own Device, you guys have that Apple announcement recently. It seems like that's becoming a bigger part of how the customers' consuming your product. I know your app is a top app on Roku. Just sort of theoretically and philosophically, how do you think about embracing that change and what it means to the business?","And then just for Chris, the CapEx step down in 2019 on cable is more significant than we were expecting. We know about 3.1 rolling off all-digital, but those are relatively modest numbers in the grand scheme of the decline you're pointing out. So maybe if you could just numerate the other drivers of that step down that are material just to help us think about what happened over the longer term? That would be helpful.","Tom Rutledge","All right, Ben. So on the video business, which we talked about a lot, obviously, the video business is going through changes. But there's a lot of consistency as well in the video business in terms of the way bundled packages still remain the primary services that we offer. I think we embraced where the marketplace is going. And we want to have people use video services on our network. And we think there are ways for us to be in the connected video business in a way that continues to provide incremental margins for us being in that business at the same time using the video business to drive our core business, which is connectivity.","And the mix of direct-to-consumer and the mix of direct-to-consumer hardware Bring Your Own Device in the video space, I think will change through time. And we're going to allow it to change as the market dictates and try to make our products work best on every device that we provide. There's still significant opportunities for us providing CPE devices to consumers, bringing in all of their services together in one consistent way. That said, there are consumers that definitely want CPE and there may be CPE vendors that create great CPE. And we're open to being a supermarket of video services, however, those services develop. And we think that that we can run our traditional models and new models simultaneously. And when we look at video usage on our network it's actually going up.","Chris Winfrey","Ben on the CapEx step down, the question remitted to the amount of -- the significant amount of step down, which is already going to start occur in the first quarter of this year. You hit at some of the big ones on the head. That\u2019s all-digital is now complete. DOCSIS 3.1 is now complete. Another item is that SPP migration naturally starts to slow. We now have over 70% of the acquired customers that are now migrating already to SPP, and just as you get further up the curve that level of migration slows.","We've been in two and half years of pretty intense integration and a lot of those integration programs have either completed or the heavy expenditure related to them was completed. I'll give you one big example. A lot of the software development that we've talked about in order to be able to put it all of the call center field operations into a national standardized virtualized and specialized structure, a lot of that spend has occurred. And while some of those platforms are still being rolled out during 2019 and there's capital associated with that the level of CapEx attached to that is lower. The same thing would apply for a lot of the in-sourcing where we've done \u2013 where there's tools trucks, tools and equipment into big when there is also real estate when you think about call centers.","It doesn't mean that some of the activity is not still going on in 2019. It is, but it's just at a significantly lower level. So those are big programs that are either wound up, or winding up. There are a couple of other trends that exist inside the business that will be continuing to go forward, to improve the capital expenditure per passing or the capital expenditure per customer relationship it. Some of it also ties to OpEx as well. We are increasing our self-installation rate. And so that has an impact both on OpEx as well as CapEx. And then the other areas that for a lot of the reasons that Tom just mentioned we are having a lower amount of new video CPE per installation.","So when that comes about because of the market trends that Tom was talking about and our ability to just service that marketplace, the other piece comes from the fact that we just deployed, so much new CPE in the context of all-digital and through the SPP migration that you have a fully populated base of really capable video set-top boxes that are both qualm and IP capable in the marketplace. That means on the Internet when you're replacing a churning customer with a new customer they need to go out and buy new CPE is significant reduced for what it's been in the past couple of years.","Tom Rutledge","The one thing I would also add is that, the mix of capital that we're allocating and the capital we do spend is increasing toward the network which is the Internet and the speed and the capability of the Internet. And so while video the cost per byte video CPE are coming down and the cost to provide customer connectivity in the home and service throughout the home are coming down, due to the ability to self provision relationships. The actual investment in the network capability itself is going up, all the while capital intensity is coming down in the aggregate for the home business.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Ben. Michelle, we will take our next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","Well, thanks so much. Tom, I know it's early, but are you seeing the benefits from the reduced service interactions so far in 2019 or perhaps better as would be per systems that have already completed customer-facing integration efforts previously? Any comments on sort of progress on customer comps would be helpful. And for Chris, I'm a bit confused on margins.","If I look at 4Q advertising it looks like margins are down slightly year-over-year. You talked about growth in customers which is good for margins. There was \u2013 Tom I think mentioned lower churn which is good for margin. But I have it right that investment in integration and in-sourcing is still hitting the margins in 4Q and if that's, how did that progressing 2019 does it get better right away in 1Q 2019 or is it get better throughout the year? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","Well, on the cost to service should \u2013 we did say in the fourth quarter that we saw churn reductions. Those churn reductions come from our ability to manage the operation better, including how we create new customers but also the quality of the service infrastructure that we're providing and its impact on customer life. And so to the extent that we're able to create a satisfied customer base by creating products at reasonable prices that have low friction in them from a relationship perspective meaning we have less service calls and we\u2019ll have a lesser friction in the transaction and scheduling of activity that creates an environment where the average customer life gets greater and you have less transactions per consumer. And that means that you have less cost per consumer.","And so you can have \u2013 so in a static environment without growth, you get significant margin improvements. And in a growth environment you get a less expensive growth environment. And so that's how we see the business developing and why we made the investments we did.","Chris Winfrey","Doug your question on Q4 not looking at the analysis that you're starting to do my guess is that you've either included mobile operating costs and\/or you haven't backed out advertising costs associated with political. So advertising if you just took out the political advertising but didn't take out the expense related to that, you might be able to get to know where you were coming out. But our margins when adjusted for political advertising margin with leading mobile outside increased year-over-year. As it relates to 2019, our goal for the entire year 2019 is on the cable side to increase our margin and some of that will depend on product mix and rate of growth. But our goal is to increase margin year-over-year in the cable side despite as you pointed out the lack of political advertising inside 2019. So that means organically quite a good development on the margin front.","As it relates to a quarter-to-quarter there's seasonality depending on the level of connects typical in most cable companies Q1 through Q4. So I'd rather not get drawn into the seasonality and sequential development, but for the full year that's our goal subject to some of the caveats I mentioned.","Doug Mitchelson","All right. Thanks. That\u2019s all.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Doug. Michelle, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Thank you. A couple of questions. First, I guess the video question. NBC News direct-to-consumer potential offer seems really interesting for the pay-TV industry. I'm just wondering what your view is on that service, is it churn reducer or revenue generator. On advertising, I mean your growth while it may have been expensive; your growth is really at the top end of anybody's number. So wondering what you're doing differently?","And then finally on 5G, would love to get your reaction to what AT&T said yesterday on their call that 5G will replace fixed broadband. Can you talk about your views of Charter positioning as 5G rolls out?","Tom Rutledge","Sure. There's a lot there. On the NBCU opportunity, I think they have a good point and there is a huge opportunity in creating advertiser-generated programming services for the business and they're less expensive. And so I think there's details to work out there. But I think that conceptually, it makes a lot of sense. In terms of our ad sales growth, I do think we have created, using analytics and other methods, a better advertising model that allows us to create higher CPMs for our advertising business and therefore to generate more money out of that business than other advertisers in the broadcast space who don't have those capabilities.","We have a unique two-way interactive plant. We have the ability to target advertising and to help our advertising customers get more effective advertising in the television space. And we're taking advantage of that. We've also built a great sales force and we're on the streets. And we own a lot of local markets in terms of our capabilities as a sales group. And we've reaped the benefit of that in our ad sales growth in 2018. With regard to 5G, we're going to 10G. And our network is highly capable and we have a pathway to 10-gig symmetrical now spaced-out that we announced at CES as an industry. We just went to 1-gig as you know in 2018 and rolled that out across our footprint. And that's faster than the 5G fixed wireless deployments that have been spoken about so publicly.","And we think that broadband consumption, data consumption will continue to grow at a very fast rate and that our network is easy to upgrade, inexpensive to upgrade and quick to upgrade to take advantage of the future marketplace that this mass of data throughput -- that growth dictates will be required. So when we look at 5G as a fixed mobile business, it is possible to use it that way. It's not very efficient from a capital expenditure perspective in our view, because you need essentially to get \u2013 to spend an awful lot of capital to get close enough to the home to actually make 5G work effectively. So we're comfortable with our network and its capability. We're comfortable that broadband data consumption will continue to grow rapidly and that we can provide a better broadband experience at less cost than alternatives.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Thank you. ","Stefan Anninger","Thanks. Next question please, Michelle?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Just wanted to come back on the video product. Can you just talk about where we are on kind of the Spectrum Guide rollout? Has it sort of been a real differentiator in terms of reducing churn and sort of take up? And then, obviously, your broadband product has really improved over the last year. Can you talk about how share shifts are trending in markets where there is a fiber alternative by the telcos versus taking your share? Where is really the fight coming out right now? Thank you.","Tom Rutledge","So, Vijay, we're rolling our guide out on the increment as a result of the transaction and the bringing of the networks together which were all someone incompatible from a CPE and network architectural perspective. We changed our guide architecture to some extent. But we're now rolling it out on the increment pretty much everywhere and it is significant improvement. Not that our existing experience in most of our markets isn't good, but the guy that we have is better. And we think without a lot of data yet that it will provide a more lasting experienced for the consumer. We've also put that guy on our apps and we put the guide in our CPE that was retailing and in the CPE that others are retailing for us. And it's actually getting distributed quite rapidly in that space.","So we think it's an excellent consumer experience and we think that it'll add to our ability to do what I said earlier in the video business which is to both sell bundled packages Stream packages \u00e0 la carte packages and to do those in a way that is coherent and consumer friendly across all devices in the home including our own mobile devices. In terms of share shift, we continued to shift share pretty much everywhere we operate. And I guess some more than others. But our share is generally with very few exceptions shifting toward us.","Vijay Jayant","Great. Thank you so much.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Vijay. Operator, our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Phil Cusick","Hey, thanks guys. Nice to see that we're coming out of this transition and I'm thinking about churn, you said churn is coming down it's what we'd expect. Can you remind us how churn in the Legacy Time Warner and Bright House basis compare now to Charter? And I'll go from there.","Tom Rutledge","Chris, why don't you do that?","Chris Winfrey","So across all three legacy entities Phil churn is coming down year-over-year, which means that Charter just continues \u2013 the Legacy Charter just continues to get better. There's still a market difference between the churn rate Legacy Charter which is the lowest in TWC and Bright House. Bright House [indiscernible] Florida market is probably going to have a more elevated churn just due to the [mover] ratio that exist in those markets. Otherwise the service \u2013 ","Tom Rutledge","There's no good effect.","Chris Winfrey","That's right. And so I think there's still a long runway for both TWC and Bright House. And Charter even over the past three and half years has continued to get better and better on a churn ratio. But there's at least 10% differential that exists in the churn rate Legacy Charter to many of those other entities.","Tom Rutledge","But just to put that in Legacy Charter, the SPP or the pricing and packaging that we use is well into the 90 \u2013 high 90% range. And so you get the effect of lower churn in that environment and we're seeing the churn come down consistent with historic trends in Legacy Charter. But interestingly, Legacy Charter comes down, while Time Warner and Bright House come down. So the whole trend is improving, but there's still more significant upside in Time Warner.","Phil Cusick","And the first derivative is bad debt. Can you remind us where bad debt was sort of early in the process versus on 4Q? And I guess that will continue to come down as well.","Chris Winfrey","Fourth quarter was a reduction year-over-year and I expect that to improve. ","Phil Cusick","And last thing. You are very clear that the fourth quarter was a tough comp year-over-year on subs, should we think of 1Q as fairly easy comp? Or is anything else going on which you'd consider\u2026","Chris Winfrey","I wouldn't call it an easy comp. But I mean the things that we've always said before, I want to make clear that project rates that the -- just because you hit January 1st and a lot of these programs and a lot of this disruption has slowed down quite a bit, doesn't mean that there's a complete seismic shift overnight.","Similar to what we saw at Legacy Charter, there's momentum that gets built up in the marketplace. And most customers existing or non-subs don't wake up in January 1st and say now that disruption has stopped and let me either retain the service or subscribe. So I think it's still going to be a continuous improvement over longer periods of time.","And I think looking at single quarters as indication of long-term success of the operating strategy isn't really the right way to do it. So I'm not saying it's an easier or difficult comp, but I don't think that there is anything that makes it an easy comp in Q1 year-over-year. And we expect to continue to improve throughout the year.","Phil Cusick","Thanks very much.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Phil. Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Great. Maybe you guys if you could just talk a little bit about the ramifications of your new way of selling voice substituting the wireless into the wireline. First of all, does it -- does that mean we should see accelerating losses on the traditional voice side? Or are we at the right run rate?","And then two is there any margin implications? Or would that be swamped by what you guys are doing on the non-programming side? And I guess maybe just wrapping it up together in terms of margins, I mean you still show a meaningful gap in terms of overall margins, cable margins versus say your larger competitor. I mean, how do we expect that to trend over time? And is there any reason why that gap shouldn't close you guys get through these duplicative costs and see all the initiatives you're doing on the non-programming side play out? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","Well, yes. I'll speak to the mobile selling question. Yes, it's a significant transaction change, which changed in our model. And yes it has implications to wireline. We've seen -- as you know we -- as part of that we reduced the cost of wireline to less than $10 with the idea that it was a bolt-on product to a triple play with mobile. And so it has some implications to what will happen to wireline sell-in. We look at our wireline performance relative to all other wireline providers, it's significantly better. But how much of an impact that marketing change will have against a general trend of wireline substitution hard to say, but we don't think it's that material a driver to our economic performance. And we do think it's a good value for a lot of consumers.","Chris Winfrey","I think it gives you a good retention price point over time. And those new customers coming in they are not subject to the same rate roll-off discussion, because it's a $10 add-on both at promotion as well as a roll-off and so it's always a tack-on value-added services. And the $10 it's less attractive to turn it off at a later point in time. In terms of the margin implications, John, in the majority of our markets our double-play acquisition pricing is at $90 whereas our triple play in the majority of our markets used to be $90.","So I don't think there's any dramatic margin implications on an incremental basis going forward of what we're doing. So we sell double play in majority of our markets in video and Internet at $90, plus the mobile add-on to the extent somebody values the voice \u2013 fixed line voice service, it's a $10 tack-on from there versus an attractive price and it's not subject to some of the roll-off churn that you would've seen in the past. In terms of cable margin gap, I don't see anything between us and, for example, another large-scale cable operator that prevents us from being able to get the similar cable margins over time. The only the caveat, I'd say, is that we are a [triple play] cable operator, which means all of our corporate and overhead costs are embedded inside. When you look at cable for us, it's there. And so there's a bit of a dissimilarity which is inherent, if we were a conglomerate and had a whole host of different businesses and Tom Rutledge and Chris Winfrey equivalents wouldn't be inside the cable business per se. But...","Tom Rutledge","But we're not going to \u2013 not getting margins on that much.","Chris Winfrey","No. So that\u2019s good. So that's the only thing I'd add. But I think as a general notion, we've always said that we thought there was an ability to, despite having programming cost increases year-over-year to be in a business that could generate over 40% EBITDA margins in cable and our view on that.","Tom Rutledge","And still be a growth business.","Chris Winfrey","Still be a growth business and our view on that hasn't changed.","John Hodulik","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","Okay. So our final question today will come from Amy Yong from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Amy Yong","Thanks. Chris, I guess, just following up on the voice question. Can you help us think through ARPU going forward? There just seems to be a lot of moving parts. It looks like you pushed through a surcharge, but you're obviously also retooling the sales process. Just wondering how we should think about going forward. Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Yeah. Look, given what I just said to John, I don't think the voice changed itself. From a total relationship perspective, it's going to have that much impact on customer relationship ARPU. If anything, you might argue that it could be slightly positive. But the GAAP allocation of revenue amongst these products is a hornet's nest. And I, for years, said I think the best way to take a look at what's happening with ARPU is take a look at ARPU per customer relationship and the trend there. And when you get down to that, then it's pretty simple. You have the promotional pricing of the bundle of products you sell, you have the roll-off, you have any rate increases. And the big one that folds in there which is pretty easy to model is the amount of single-play Internet sell-in, which even though it's attractive, has the impact of lowering your per relationship ARPU. And that is the biggest offset to the other factors that I just mentioned.","So I would not try to model individual product line ARPUs, because I think it's a pretty deep GAAP allocation question. I'm not sure if that's useful to the public. I think the customer relationship ARPUs is the way to look at it, which is why we talked about that as opposed to some of the others.","Amy Yong","Got it. Thank you. ","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Amy. That concludes our call. Thanks everyone.","Tom Rutledge","Thank you, everyone. ","Chris Winfrey","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5041":["Charter Communications, Inc.

My name is Michelle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Charter's second quarter 2018 investor call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to Charter's second quarter 2018 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Stefan. During the second quarter, we saw higher sales of our products across each of our legacy footprints. As of the end of the second quarter, 62% of residential Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers were in our Spectrum pricing and packaging, up from 55% at the end of the first quarter. Over the last year, we've grown our total Internet customer base by over 1.2 million or 5.2%, faster than any other provider of any scale in the United States and video net losses were less than in Q2 of last year.","Our customer growth remains strong despite our significant integration activity and the short-term disruption it creates. In the second quarter, we grew total revenue by 4.8% year-over-year, including residential revenue growth of 4.6%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.2%, when excluding mobile. And we remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth through higher sales, lower churn and by increasing operational efficiency, all resulting in higher revenue per passing and lower operating and capital costs per relationship.","During the quarter, we rolled out our gigabit speed offering to more than 20 million additional passings using DOCSIS 3.1 technology. We now offer gigabit service to approximately 60% of our footprint. And we'll finish our full upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1 by the end of this year at very low cost and relatively little outside labor or physical construction. We've also raised our minimum Spectrum Internet speed to 200 megabits in about 40% of our footprint at no additional cost to our customers. We're raising our Internet speeds faster than originally planned in order to maintain our superior competitive position and it's working.","Now turning to wireless, later this year, we'll begin launching the initial version of our new wireless 802.11ax router. This new device will not only deliver multi gigabit speed throughput in future products, but also broader coverage throughout the home, and even more support for a higher number of concurrent devices of constant set of applications like video streaming and voice.","On June 30, we soft launched our Spectrum Mobile service under our MVNO agreement. We now offer mobile service to both new and existing Spectrum Internet customers at highly attractive prices. Our Unlimited service costs $45 per month and our By the Gig service is $14 per gigabyte. Both products offer unlimited talk and text and customers can change between plans mid-month.","The launch has gone very well and we're scaling the operation, which is intentionally generating relatively small order volume at the moment as we ramp up features and marketing throughout the summer. In the next few months, we'll expand our mobile capabilities, offering a wider array of mobile devices and giving customers the ability to transfer their existing handsets. We'll also expand our mobile sales channels, including offering our new service in a greater number of retail locations.","Spectrum Mobile offers new and existing customers the opportunity to save hundreds of dollars per year on their mobile bill, all while bundling that service with our superior and value-rich broadband and other connectivity services. Ultimately, the goal is to use Spectrum Mobile to attract and retain more multi-product customers, driving faster customer growth, higher penetration and greater EBITDA per passing.","Our all-digital initiative is on schedule for completion by year end. 91% of our total footprint is now all-digital. And at the end of the second quarter, only 6% of legacy Time Warner Cable customers continued to carry full analog video lineup, down from approximately 40% at the end of 2016. Approximately 50% of the Bright House footprint still carries analog signals, mostly in the Tampa area where we've started to go all-digital in June.","By the end of this year, the whole company will be fully digitized as we deploy fully functioning two-way set-top boxes, mostly our WorldBox, on all remaining analog TV outlets that we serve. Together with Spectrum Guide fully deployed at new connects, flexible streaming packages, consistent IP user guides and the introduction of our cloud-based DVR product later this year, we will have made our video product competitive and consistent nationwide.","In the meantime, the traditional video marketplace continues to be challenged by: a combination of continued programming rate increases, with rights tied to carriage of multiples services and packaging limitations; new over-the-top and virtual MVPD options, often with poor security and negative profit margins; and changing customer viewer behavior. Those trends aren't new. And given the outsized programming cost increases, video as a standalone service has been a declining margin business for some time.","And despite that, we've managed to and expect to continue to grow our EBITDA and cash flow consistently and at healthy rates. Cable's success as an industry, despite the challenges of standalone video product margin pressure, is because at our core, we provide connectivity. Going back to its inception as community access TV, retransmitting free over-the-air signals or developing broadband Internet or landline voice, and now a WiFi mobile product, the transport or connectivity business is what we've always been.","We've never looked at product-specific margins at Charter, but rather at the profitability and returns of an individual customer or passing. We continue to add new services to our network and increase our revenue per passing and lower our cost per dollar of revenue by adding significant value to as many customers as we can connected to that network.","As part of a service package, video drives connects, reduces churn and drives higher satisfaction and remains an integral part of our business strategy, even though it drives less standalone profit over time. That video relationship helps us market our connectivity services and advanced advertising to both new and existing customers. What a video subscriber or viewer is and how the video market is defined is changing, while total video consumption is going up.","If we execute well, no one is better positioned to serve that video marketplace than we are, given that our network, including traditional and IP video platforms; our service infrastructure, both wired and wireless; our significant programming relationships and role in securing content and our own local content; and our ability to package and bundle services to drive overall connectivity relationship growth.","While we use video to drive connections, our business plan continues to assume that programming costs will continue to grow, that emerging video \u2013 or virtual MVPDs will aggressively price their product and that traditional MVPD market will continue to contract even though we're growing share. And whether or not our traditional video units grow a little or decline a little has little bearing on our ability to accelerate consolidated cash flow growth and create a lot of value for our shareholders.","As a reminder, we have shown our value creation model on slide 5 of today's presentation. Ultimately, our long-term growth opportunity comes from powerful, having an easy to upgrade network that allows us to offer data-rich wireline and wireless products that consumers want and businesses need. And our customer penetration, which is just above 50%, is low relative to where it should be, considering the quality of our wireline and wireless products today and in the future.","Business products have an even greater penetration upside. The capability of our plant will continue to expand with these advanced DOCSIS product rollouts and the convergence of our wireline and wireless architectures, allowing us to offer high-capacity, high-compute, low latency connectivity products both inside and outside of the home.","So we have an excellent runway for customer growth and a significant opportunity for operational cost efficiencies from improving products and service and reducing transactions. And our expected EBITDA growth, combined with our declining capital intensity, balance sheet strategy and tax assets, will yield industry-leading free cash flows per share growth in the coming years.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. Before covering our results, a few administrative items. This is the first quarter which we presented our customer results using consistent definitions across all three legacy entities. On July 11, we issued an 8-K announcing that we had posted a revised trending schedule on our IR website and that trending schedule shows our customers results under the uniform methodology going back to the beginning of 2016 and provides a reconciliation schedule to our previous reporting.","As I mentioned on our last call, starting the third quarter of this year, I expect we'll only report consolidated operating statistics and revenue results. We may still call out legacy entity drivers where relevant, but we'll report as one company.","Finally, recall that starting on January 1 of this year, we prospectively adopted FASB's new revenue recognition standard. There are a number of relatively small adjustments in the quarter related to the adoption of the standard, both in revenue and expenses, which in total lowered EBITDA by a single-digit million dollar amount this quarter as compared to last year.","Now turning to our results. Total residential and SMB customer relationships grew by 196,000 in the second quarter and grew 884,000 over the last 12 months, with 3.2% growth at TWC, 3.3% at Legacy Charter and 4.2% at Bright House. Including residential and SMB, Internet grew by 267,000 in the quarter, video declined by 57,000, and voice declined by 8,000. 62% of residential TWC and Bright House customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the second quarter.","Second quarter customer connects were higher year-over-year in each of the Legacy footprints and while voluntary churn was lower year-over-year, total relationship disconnects were higher. The key driver was higher non-pay disconnects from integration-related system issues we discussed last quarter. Those issues were fixed and the non-pay churn from those issues is improving on the timeline we outlined.","To give a better sense of how the quarter progressed, consolidated residential customer relationship net additions were a little lower year-over-year in April, closer to prior-year in May, and in June, customer relationship net additions in video and Internet PSU adds were a bit better year-over-year for consolidated Charter and at each of the three Legacy entities.","In residential Internet, we added a total of 218,000 residential customers versus 230,000 last year. Total company Internet sales were higher year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, as of late 2Q, we now offer 200 megabits per second as our minimum Internet speed in about 40% of our footprint and we offer gigabit service in approximately 60% of our footprint. And we expect to have gigabit service available nearly everywhere by the end of 2018.","Over the last 12 months, we grew our total residential Internet customer base by 1.1 million customers, or 4.8%, with 4.7% growth at TWC, 4.8% growth at Legacy Charter, and 5.6% at Bright House. Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by 2.2%. Pre-deal Charter declined by 1.5% and Legacy Bright House video was flat year-over-year. Over the last year, over 100% of our total video net losses were from limited basic. In voice, we lost 45,000 residential video customers versus a gain of 14,000 last year, driven primarily by higher non-pay churn at TWC and lower upgrade and attach rates.","Over the last year, we grew total residential customer relationships by 714,000 or 2.8%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.7% year-over-year, given the lower rate of SPP migration, rate adjustments, fewer limited basic customers and promotional campaign roll-off that was partly offset by higher levels of Internet-only customers and better sales with sell-in at promotional rates.","Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 4.6%. Beginning this quarter, our GAAP accounting allocated more revenue away from billed residential voice into primarily residential video, and a GAAP allocation between products has no impact on total residential revenue or revenue growth. But as we've noted in the past, our reported product revenue does not reflect revenue allocation on customer bills.","That's one of the reasons we stopped reporting individual product ARPU several years ago, because focusing on the product revenue and product ARPU growth rates does not reflect how we market and bill our bundled services. This reporting challenge is likely to grow over time with the introduction of mobile, which really just argues for (16:10) continued focus on total residential revenue, customer relationships, and bundling.","Turning to commercial revenue. Total SMB and enterprise combined grew by 4.4% in the second quarter, with SMB up 2.9% and enterprise up by 6.7%. Excluding cell backhaul and Navisite, Spectrum Enterprise grew revenue by 10%. Sales are up in both SMB and enterprise. And TWC together with Bright House have grown SMB customer relationships by over 11% in the last year.","Our SMB revenue growth in the TWC and Bright House markets hasn't yet followed the unit growth, and it won't until we get through the transition to more competitive pricing in both our SMB and enterprise products. We expect that ARPU offset will continue through 2018 but the revenue growth will ultimately follow the unit growth.","Second quarter advertising revenue grew by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in political and advanced advertising products that allow for more targeted selling with better inventory utilization. Excluding political, advertising revenue grew by about 3% year-over-year. In total, second quarter revenue for the company was up 4.8% year-over-year and 4.5% when excluding advertising.","Turning to operating expenses on slide 10. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $293 million or 4.5% year-over-year. Programming increased 5.8% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases and renewals and a higher expanded customer base and mix. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 5.1%, primarily driven by our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, which reclassed some expenses to this line in the quarter.","Costs to service customers grew by 1.2% year-over-year, or roughly a third of our customer relationship growth rate. So even with the temporary impact of higher bad debt expense, we are lowering our per relationship service cost through changes in business practices and seeing early productivity benefits from ongoing insourcing investments.","Marketing expenses grew by 1.2% year-over-year, but benefited from lower transition costs this year. And other expenses were up 5.8% year-over-year, driven by higher IT cost from ongoing integration less synergy benefits and higher ad sales cost, insurance costs and enterprise spend tied to growth.","Excluding $33 million of mobile expenses, primarily launch-related, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted cable EBITDA grew by 6.2% in the second quarter. When including the impact of mobile, adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.3%.","Turning to net income on slide 11. We generated $273 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $139 million last year, and that increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower severance-related expenses partly offset by higher interest expense.","Turning to slide 12. Capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in the second quarter. And the higher year-over-year spending was primarily driven by scalable infrastructure, support capital and line extensions. The increase in scalable infrastructure was related to more consistent timing of in-year spend, and planned product improvements for video and Internet, including spending related to DOCSIS 3.1 launches. We also spent more in the support categories on vehicles, software development and facility spend tied to insourcing, and about $45 million of which was related to our Spectrum Mobile launch, mostly in the way of software and stores.","Line extension spending was up year-over-year as we continue to build out and fulfill our merger conditions. CPE spend was down year-over-year given inventory build from the migration of customers to Spectrum pricing and packaging last year, an all-digital inventory build in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. We spent about $88 million in all-digital this quarter versus $5 million in the second quarter last year and $186 million in the first quarter of this year. So our CapEx spending is more level-loaded this year than last.","For the full year, we continue to expect a cable capital intensity or cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be similar and slightly lower than 2017. We also expect 2019 cable CapEx to be down in absolute dollar terms and in terms of capital intensity.","Before moving on to cash flow, I wanted to provide a brief update on our Spectrum Mobile product which, as Tom mentioned, launched on June 30 and is going well. During the quarter, we didn't generate any mobile revenue, but we had $33 million in mobile operating expense, driven by mobile-related personnel and overhead costs to prepare for our launch. That $33 million in negative adjusted EBITDA, combined with the total mobile CapEx of $53 million, mostly for software and stores, and mobile working capital usage of $30 million, yielded mobile free cash flow of negative $116 million in the quarter.","As Tom mentioned, we'll be launching additional devices and bring your own device options over the coming months, which will put us in a position for a broader market launch. The more customer growth we generate, the more incremental revenue we'll generate from mobile and from cable. Much of that revenue in the beginning will be device contract revenue, which is fully recognized on the contract date and similarly, as cost of goods sold under EIP accounting, with the customer payments for handsets received over a longer period, hence the working capital headwind.","The more mobile customer growth we generate early on, the more EBITDA and cash flow drag we'll experience in the early days, but we expect the incremental mobile P&L to be significantly NPV positive with broader growth benefits to our core cable services. We won't present mobile as a separate P&L or segment, but we will attempt to isolate the early effects on revenue, operating expense, CapEx and working capital, so long as the allocation of revenue still makes it relevant.","Should also mention that we finalized our mobile JV with Comcast this quarter with a portion of the funding representing an equity investment on our balance sheet and a portion representing a prepayment of software development and related services for the mobile back-office platform also on our balance sheet. As the partnership spends on development and service delivery, we reflect those services as capital or operating expense, depending on the nature of the services delivered.","Slide 13 shows we generated $804 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, including $116 million of investment in mobile that I mentioned a moment ago. Excluding mobile, we generated $920 million of cable free cash flow compared to $1.1 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was largely driven by a smaller working capital benefit than in the prior year timing, higher CapEx year-over-year, and higher cash paid for interest. That was partly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower severance expenses.","We finished the quarter with $71 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $3.8 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggests a $3.5 billion annual run rate. That difference is primarily due to purchase accounting.","As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47 times, within our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. At the end of the quarter, we held over $700 million in cash and additional revolver capacity of $3.9 billion. And in July, we repaid $2 billion of debt maturity and also raised $1.5 billion in the investment-grade market.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $1.9 billion at an average price of $291 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased nearly 17% of Charter's equity. We intend to stay at or below 4.5 times on a consolidated basis, including the impact of mobile on our financials.","So we're in good shape. At the end of this year, we'll be operating Charter as one company in a very competitive way. Spectrum pricing and packaging migration will be almost complete. All-digital will be done and we'll be offering Spectrum Guide to all new video customers. DOCSIS 3.1 and higher speeds will be available everywhere. Mobile will be fully launched, with a very attractive offer for cable sales and retention. And our service operations integration will be nearly complete, which we expect will continue to lower transaction volume and drive cost savings and service improvement.","There's still ongoing internal and customer disruption to make that happen. It is, for the most part, purposeful, so we can grow even faster sooner. The operating strategy outlined on slide 5 works and when combined with our tax assets, declining capital intensity and ROI-based capital allocation, leaves us very well-positioned to drive strong returns for our shareholders.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. So a question first for Chris, if you sort of look at the cost of servicing customers, it's actually increased in the last two quarters while it was sort of down last year. Is that increase all sort of tied to the credit screening software glitch? And assuming that's sort of done by the end of 2Q, can that sort of revert back to declining?","And second, just a broader question, obviously, there was a story out last week that the New York PSC is probably going to revoke, request you to undo the merger in some form. Can you just talk about what are the implications there, how we should think about what that really means? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Vijay, I'll answer the second part of the question first. We believe we're in compliance with the plain reading and the buildout requirements that the state imposed on us in merger conditions and we have a very strong legal case and ability to defend ourselves. And it could play out over a lengthy period of time if required.","Just to put it in perspective, we're operating in 41 states, we have thousands of franchise agreements and generally, we have good relationships with the communities we serve and we live up to our commitments, and we have in New York State. In fact, we're well ahead of our obligations in terms of speed upgrades and in buildout itself.","We do have labor issues in New York City which we believe have politicized the actions of the PSC, and so we're concerned about that. We've successfully negotiated other agreements with the same union, IBEW, in other parts of the country during this period. So we're hopeful that we can work all this out, but if necessary, we'll litigate and we believe we're in the right.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","On the first question, Vijay, I think your question was cost to service customers, could it go flat again or even negative. We don't provide overall guidance much less line by line, but what I can tell you is the cost to service customers was essentially flat year-over-year, absent the increase in bad debt expense. And you have to take that in the context of still fairly significant customer relationship growth, which means that whether or not you exclude that temporary increase in bad debt expense, we're getting significantly more efficient at the same time that we're still making investments in insourcing. So I think that bodes well for the long-term of our ability to continue to get more and more productive on that line item.","And the bigger impact on that isn't just a cost impact, what it really means is that our customers are contacting us less, which means that they're having less service issues, service disruption, less billing related calls, less retention related calls, which means that churn is going down and your customer lives (28:52) are going up, as satisfaction is higher. And that really has an impact, a significant impact on the top line, which is the biggest driver for EBITDA and margin and cash flow growth over time. So you're right to focus on it and I think that it can continue to deliver an outsized benefit relative to the customer relationship growth over time.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. Michelle, our next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks, a question for Chris. I'm wondering if you can give us some more context around your decisions on wireless pricing. So I think, Chris, earlier in the year, you suggested the expectation that you guys would be pretty aggressive in wireless with the launch. And with the pricing coming in higher than where Comcast was on a per gigabyte basis, I'm just wondering what you sort of learned from their experience and from your own testing and trials before launching. Are you thinking you'll be less aggressive in general or do you think you can take share aggressively at this level of pricing?","(30:17)","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes. There's a lot to be said for the way Comcast prices and packages their product, we actually admire some of the things they did and think they're both good business and disruptive at the same time. But we make our own prices and our own analysis of the marketplace and this is where we came out on pricing for the long haul in terms of launching our business and being aggressive with our business.","I think if you really think about how you make the business grow, it's not just the standalone pricing of the business, but how you integrate it into your overall sales process, packaging process. And so whether we're aggressive or not is in the eye of the beholder, and obviously in terms of what kind of actual market share we take. I saw a statistic the other day, it was kind of interesting to me, which was that Charter's actually the largest wireline phone company in North America. And we've never sold phone as a standalone product. So you can do very well with a product but our intention is to use mobility as a feature of our overall customer relationship creation process.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jonathan. Michelle, we'll take our next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning. One for Tom and one for Chris. Tom, on the broadband product and all the improvements you're making, you talk about what your expectations are for Verizon's 5G launch, which I believe is coming to L.A. I'm not sure if it's going to be in your L.A. footprint but just generally, how you're thinking about the impact that may have on your business. And how are the higher minimum speeds that you've deployed and the 1-gigabit service is impacting your customer metrics here as we move into the second half, either sales or churn?","And then for Chris, thank you for the disclosure on the CapEx front on all-digital. Just to help us \u2013 remind us, how do you define all-digital spending? And should we be thinking about this what looks to be run rating $500 million-plus number for the year as sort of completely going away in 2019? And are there any other factors we should be thinking about, at least qualitatively, that may change next year versus this year on the CapEx side? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So Ben, with regard to the speed increases, yes, there's a couple ways of looking at what we're doing with speed. We're taking and making our data product better and more competitive everywhere we operate, so that we can increase the rate of our growth and take share faster.","And we think that it's successful and that it's working where it's been rolled out. And as I said, we rolled out 20 million homes passed in the quarter and we're about 60% through our 50 million homes passed in general. So we're really just getting started from a speed marketing activation and implementation perspective. But it appears to be working where we thought it would and we expect to get higher growth rates in the future as a result of having a better product. It's that simple.","With regard to 5G, I look at what Verizon has announced as a kind of a conventional overbuild. Small cells require, essentially, a fiber optic cable system to supply them. So there's a lot of capital intensity with that kind of build. Their projection was to build 30 million passings in the United States over 10 years, which, if you believe that's going to happen, then 40% of those approximately would be in our footprint, if they deploy them with any kind of random distribution. And so you could do the math of what kind of penetrations you might achieve with a met-too product delivered wirelessly over a 10-year period in 12 million passings.","So I think it's a difficult process to use 5G as essentially as a wireless drop and it requires having all of the physical assets underneath that. So it's very capital-intensive and maybe as much or more capital-intensive than the conventional fiber build, like Google attempted.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Ben, on all-digital, we define the all-digital capital expenditures, any and all incremental capital expenditure related to rolling out all-digital, the vast, vast majority of that sits in CPE and installation, but it would also apply to certain network spend that takes place right as we begin to take a particular market all-digital, but the vast majority of it's in the CPE category which includes installation.","Your question was also does it go away in 2019. It does. I think already, in the, particularly, the fourth quarter this year, you'll see it come down quite a bit because we'll have all the inventory replaced for the all-digital activity that we're going to do. The bigger point is not only will it go away in 2019, but our level of video CPE becomes permanently lower. And that happens because you've fully capitalized the existing base with set-top boxes and it happens because on the increment, we're deploying more of our video subscriber outlets in an IP format where it doesn't require a set-top box, which means that you can utilize returned set-top boxes for new customers without having additional CPE buy.","So I think our level of video CPE placement has peaked and is going to drop dramatically. It's fully capitalized with new boxes that are both IP and QAM-capable, and I think that just continues to improve over time. We'll also have in 2019 a lot less integration capital, DOCSIS 3.1 is a big spend last year and this year, that goes away. So I think the amount of CapEx reduction that we have going into last year is not going to be inconsequential both in dollar and percentage terms.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, Chris.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Ben. Michelle, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Jessica Reif from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So hi. I've got three questions. First on advertising, your numbers were stronger than the industry is likely to be, just wondering if you can give some color on some of the things you're doing there. Then on SMB, the adds were so much stronger than revenue. Can you just talk a little bit about what will drive revenue growth going forward and maybe some color on what the underlying margins are?","And then finally, can you talk \u2013 I know this comes up a lot, but is there any interest in some kind of content, specifically Disney will be forced to sell the RSNs [regional sports networks] as part of the Fox acquisition. Could you comment on any potential interest in that?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Okay, I'll take advertising. This is a political year, and we have a lot of battleground states, although it appears that those continue to increase in quantity, so there's that effect in our advertising revenue. We're also growing our underlying advertising at the expense of other broadcast products essentially at the local level, but it's a difficult business. We've been investing and targeting and changing the nature of advertising itself, and we're selling a lot more data-infused products as well as digitals products themselves for advertising.","And so the revenue's going up and we're proud of it, but it's also \u2013 it's got a lot of winds behind its back in terms of having a political year. But the underlying core advertising business, too, you can almost look at the advertising business on biannual cycles, based on the political effect in advertising. But we're making headway at the core of our advertising product and our advertising business.","In SMB, you're right, the revenue growth is relatively small to the unit growth. And that's a conscious strategy based on our pricing and packaging. We think we're at about the nadir of growth in terms of revenue growth, meaning the decisions we made to reprice the small business marketplace and to drive a market share strategy means that we're growing very rapidly and creating increases in market share, which we expect to continue. And we had an existing base of subscribers who were mispriced in many cases, and that mispricing is coming out of the business. And we expect that going forward, that revenues will start to converge on the unit growth rate. And so we expect to have a significant and fast growing unit and revenue business going forward. And there's some of that in our enterprise business as well.","And lastly on content, our views on content haven't changed. A lot of content companies have come to us and asked us to buy them. And we so far not found a situation that made sense to us. We like our core business. We like our connectivity business. It doesn't mean that there isn't a possible content business that would be priced right for us, but there's no direct synergy, in most cases, for us in owning content.","Now we do have a different point of view on local news, and we've been investing in local news. We think it's an area where our assets and the product actually makes sense from a scale perspective. So we're about to launch a 24 hour local news channel in Los Angeles. And we've been doing similar repurposing of existing local sports and local news channels throughout the country and turning them into high quality local news channels. So our view on content is unchanged, regardless of the way the current marketplace is developing.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jessica. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Wanted to just ask you two questions. First on share repurchases, my impression has been that if you're going to use the high end of your target leverage range, it would be to pursue strategic opportunities. So I wanted to ask you, since you're near the high end now just through share repurchases, what's the appetite to stay at the high end of the range to repurchase shares or even go above the high end in order to take advantage of the stock price?","And then separately, one of your peers is growing programming costs per sub at less than 5% so far this year. Is there a reason for Charter's programming cost per sub growth to dip down to these levels at some point over the next couple of years or will the contract renewal cadence preclude that kind of outcome? Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","So, Bryan, on the share repurchases, the amount of share repurchases we've been doing over the past couple quarters, just simple math, it's to your point, we've been staying at the high end of the 4 to 4.5 times. We are trying to make sure that we have enough headroom each quarter to stay within an LTM 4.5 times including the temporary impact of the mobile launch costs.","And, as I mentioned before, there's a little push and pull there as it relates to growth on mobile because of the temporary impacts you have, that could be higher. But the business at its core has a capability to delever a half turn, plus or minus, within a year. So to the extent strategic opportunities come about and you want to modify it because you think that's better, you have a way to get to what is a half a turn on Charter's a pretty substantial amount of capital, if you really saw something that had a better ROI relative to buying back your own stock. And that's the lens that we would look at it.","We have not had and we do not have a willingness to temporarily or permanently go above our leverage target. And the primary reason for that is that we do have $71 billion of capital. We have commitments as it relates to our investment-grade structure and we intend to honor those. And we think the long-term NPV of doing so is better not only for debt holders but for equity holders. And I'm not so sure that many of our equity holders would like to see us go above that in any event as it relates to just doing buybacks. So that's our stance. It hasn't changed and we are trying to be aggressive, given the recent stock price within those constraints, to buy back stock.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know what peer you're referring to on programming costs, but I would say this that because we are actually growing expanded video, and the video losses that we have incurred are basic-only, meaning broadcast-only video losses, we are actually growing our programming costs based on unit volumes. So if you're a programmer receiving payments from Charter, your programming costs are increasing due to volume. We're actually creating rich packages of video for our programmers. And so there's the unit cost and then there's the actual volume cost. And even though it looks like units are going down, from a programming perspective, they're going up.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the color on both. Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Tom, in last night's proxy filing from T-Mobile, it looks as though there were interested parties in Sprint that it's easy to imagine Company A or Company B was likely Charter. I just wondered if you could comment on whether a year ago, you had interest in acquiring wireless assets and how you would view that today.","And then second unrelated question, I wonder if you could comment on John Malone stepping down from your board and we've got a lot of questions about that. Maybe you could share your thoughts.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Okay. Well, I don't know what's in the \u2013 I didn't read the proxy, unlike you, of T-Mobile, but we didn't make an attempt to buy any wireless assets. That isn't to say that we didn't have significant discussions with Sprint about an MVNO relationship. We had virtually no discussions with T-Mobile as I recall.","With regard to \u2013 just on that question of wireless convergence and assets, I think that our ability to create mobile customers and our ability to create wireless products on our network is sufficient right now, and that we have advantages in our network infrastructure that will allow us to build an inside-out strategy in wireless that we think doesn't require any kind of immediate mobile relationship other than an MVNO. It doesn't mean that sometime in the future mobile assets might be priced right and that natural convergence would occur, but there's nothing in our near-term horizon that dictates that we go that path.","With regard to John Malone, John is going to stay on as a director emeritus. He's been in the business 50 years. I love having him on the board. I'm happy that he's staying as director emeritus. He remains the control shareholder of Liberty Broadband, which owns about 20% of Charter, and he still has a right to appoint three board members and has. And we welcome Jim Meyer of Sirius to our board, and we think he brings real value to us.","We think that John will continue to be engaged with the company, that he likes the business. I like having him engage with the company. He brings tremendous insight to us, but he wants to reduce his workload and he's overboarding, so to speak, and he's just reached a point in his life where he feels like he has to. But we do board meetings in Denver and we may do them in Florida. So we think he'll be involved with us for years to come.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. Thanks, Craig. Michelle, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Douglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","The declining video subscribers is manageable and programming costs would continue to rise, and that seems like a less combative stance than I've heard from you previously. And I, for one, personally doubt you'll be less combative. So I'm trying to understand how do you \u2013 what are the execution imperatives to manage the declining video subscriber base? Do you have to reduce overhead costs? Do you have to do skinny bundles or package definitely in the future? Does traditional programming relationships break down at some point?","And then for Chris, a question I know you're going to love. You know that mobile will be significantly NPV positive over time. Obviously, we're all trying to figure out that path. So I guess the question is what penetration of customers or homes or broadband customers does mobile have to reach to reach NPV breakeven? And since you won't answer that, how long to breakeven overall? Or any metrics at all we can use to try to think about how mobile's going to impact numbers over the next few years would be super helpful. Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","We appreciate your candor, first of all.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","And your love. So look, we're going to be aggressive and we're going to use video aggressively. But what we're saying is that it isn't really a standalone product in its current situation. People have been asking this question about video for a long time now and well more than five years, probably closer to 10 \u2013 maybe the whole experience of video broadcasting was dead when I got into the business 40 years ago and it's still around.","So what you can \u2013 even though you can see the future, it's very hard to say when. I would say that there's a lot of forces still holding the traditional MVPD relationships together, including what you just saw with Disney acquiring the Fox assets. And there's still a large group of very large content companies that control significant linear and sports content. And that's all contractually bound together in packages.","So while there is some degradation in the whole relationship and it has become overpriced in many cases, and it's actually pushing people out of the marketplace, that said, video consumption is still high. And part of that is because video is free, in many cases, because of the security that's on a lot of the virtual MVPDs and the TV Everywhere products and the password sharing on other over-the-top products. All of that is putting pressure on traditional video, but at the same time, it's the perfect way of selling content. And so it isn't just going to go away overnight.","How fast? I don't know. But I think we can manage our way through it and use video to drive relationships for the foreseeable future. And yes, we have streaming packages. And yes, every incremental box we're putting out has a Netflix app on it. And so we're going to supply our customers with all the video they can get and use video however it develops and whoever owns it in a way that enhances the customer relationship and uses the video as an attribute of the overall product that we sell. So I guess the simple answer is I don't know what happens exactly, but that's how we're playing it.","Douglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","The only piece I'd add to that is the non-programming OpEx and the CapEx for video is actually declining, and that particular piece is going to improve the economics over time. Whether it fully offsets the programming is unclear, but it's not inconsequential.","On mobile, so you're right, we're not going to provide guidance. We're not going to provide breakeven, and we hope that people will trust that when we say that it has a significant positive NPV on a standalone basis, without including the benefits to cable. And that's based on a significant amount of modeling and understanding of how those businesses works.","Comcast does not have separate economics. I actually haven't heard it, but I understand that they've spoken about what it would take for them to get to breakeven. I haven't looked at it, but given that our financial model isn't any different, because we operate under the same MVNO, my guess is it's not so dissimilar. And that's a relatively low level of penetration of the overall subscriber base that we have.","If you think about every customer service interaction that we have, whether it's a sales call or a retention call, and including into that existing call volume and flow, a mobile sale opportunity, it doesn't take you very much yield before you have the substantial wireless business that's applied to your existing base and use it as a way to drive additional cable growth. So I think on the increment, every single mobile customer that we acquire is NPV positive once you're in the business. And that's on a standalone basis without including the benefits of churn reduction or new subscriber acquisition on the cable side.","Douglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Sure.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. Michelle, we'll take our last question please.","Operator","Our final question will come from Amy Yong from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. I was wondering if you could comment on pricing in general. I know that ARPU is not a focus and volume is more important for the company. But video revenue grew really nicely in the quarter, just wondering what the puts and takes are going forward now that this non-pay churn issue is over? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","You want to take that, Chris?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Amy, if you go back and I know it was quick, but in the prepared remarks that we have \u2013 our GAAP accounting is applying a higher amount of revenue allocation out of voice into video, that doesn't mean that's what we've billed. So the video growth rate that we've reported in Q2 is inflated relative to what's on the customer bill. It's still positive. So it's about half the growth that's attached to just that revenue allocation out of voice, and the same amount is not happening into Internet from voice, which means product ARPU, product revenue is just getting less and less relevant by the quarter in terms of how it's helpful to investors and which is why we focus people on the residential revenue per customer relationship.","The piece that remains on video growth, even though we've lost video customers on a year-over-year basis, it's all come out of the limited basic or actual (56:16) expanded, which is the traditional expanded and the Stream and Choice, has actually grown year-over-year, which has higher revenue attached to it. We've also gone all-digital, which means there's higher box placement, Spectrum pricing and packaging also with higher box placement. And retrans, we've just mirrored that cost flowing through the retrans revenue line as well. So those are the big drivers on the non-revenue allocation piece for video.","But I would really caution on looking too much at the product revenue line and really focus on the number of customer relationships we have, the type of bundling that we're getting and the type of revenue per customer relationship growth that's being achieved within that context.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Stefan Anninger, you may begin your conference, sir.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome to Charter's fourth quarter 2015 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website at ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent proxy statements and Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call; however, we encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stefan. Charter's Spectrum, our advanced and high-value product suite, continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate, and Charter remains the fastest-growing cable company in the United States.","By providing highly competitive products at attractive price points and simple packages with quality service, we will continue to add customer relationships inside both Charter's legacy footprint and new Charter's broader footprint. We'll do that by applying the same customer-friendly operating strategy to the Time Warner Cable and Bright House assets as we migrate those footprints to our Spectrum product, pricing, packaging, and customer-friendly operating practices.","We finished 2015 with 6.7 million residential and small business customers. For the full year, that base of customers grew by 6%, with residential customer growth growing by 5% and SMB growing by 17%. We grew our total video customer base by 11,000 relationships in 2015, compared to a loss of 78,000 last year. This is the first time in over a decade that Charter has added video customers over any 12-month period.","Driving that growth is an improved video offering with better pictures, more HD than satellite, Video On Demand and Interactive Guide functionality on every TV outlet, combined with high-quality, in-sourced and U.S.-based customer service, all in an easy-to-understand pricing and packaging structure, which makes our products competitive well beyond the point of sale.","We also continued to grow our Internet business in 2015. We added nearly 450,000 residential Internet customers, up 9% compared to last year. Our low-cost, high-speed Internet offering provides great value to consumers, whether purchased inside one of our bundles or on a standalone basis. Nearly, one-third of our total residential customers, close to 2 million customers, are now non-video customers and that grew by about 18% year-over-year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our residential Internet customers subscribed to Internet service that provided speeds of 60 megabits or more.","We continue to be an industry leader in Internet customer growth by offering high speeds at low prices points with no data caps, no usage-based billing, no modem rental fees; and that's been our operating practice for the last four years, and we plan to continue to that.","In Commercial, we also continued to drive accelerating customer growth. After we separated our Small Business and Enterprise segments early last year, we launched new pricing and packaging to both marketplaces and are seeing the results we expected.","SMB PSU growth accelerated by 30% from 2015 and 47% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In time, that accelerating Commercial unit growth will drive faster revenue growth as it has in Residential. Business services remains an area of significant long-term opportunity for Charter and we have demonstrated that we can grow business customers faster with a highly-competitive operating strategy.","For the full year, we grew our revenue by 7.1%. Excluding Advertising, revenue grew by 7.7%, all while taking meaningful lower pricing increases than in 2014. Our EBITDA growth, excluding transition costs, grew by 8.5% and continued to exceed our revenue growth. That EBITDA growth combined with declining capital intensity is driving greater free cash flow conversion. We generated approximately $550 million of free cash flow in 2015, up from approximately $170 million last year.","Excluding M&A-related costs, our free cash flow was even higher, over $1 billion, up $700 million compared to 2014 on the same basis. So as we continue to grow our EBITDA and our capital intensity declines, Charter is becoming a meaningful generator of free cash.","In 2016, we have three key priorities: executing on our core customer growth strategy in both Residential and Commercial, making the Spectrum product set even better and, finally, closing and integrating Time Warner Cable and Bright House.","Starting with our core customer growth strategy, we remain focused on growing our business by increasing long-lasting customer relationships rather than through just price increases. We grow loyal customer relationships by going to market with simple, high-quality products, Charter Spectrum, which we offer at very affordable prices, and those prices will essentially remain flat in 2016.","Over the past four years, we've hired over 7,000 people to help us support our products with customer service provided by our own people as opposed to contract labor offshore. In the new company, we'll need to hire about 20,000 more people to do the same, proportionally.","As we train and manage our own employees, we're creating a skilled labor force that is executing higher-quality service transactions with our customers when we sell and provision, install, answer billing questions, or handle repairs.","Today, nearly 90% of our customer calls are handled onshore and in-house, and 95% of our service truck rolls are in-house. Those higher-quality customer interactions are reducing service transactions, reducing churn, and creating longer customer relationships, supporting greater customer growth and reducing our operating costs.","We're also making Spectrum products even better. Through the course of 2016, we're rolling out our new cloud-based Spectrum Guide. Our initial Spectrum Guide launches are working and scaling well with positive customer response. Spectrum Guide's more intuitive and feature-rich user interface improves both video search and discovery, fully enables our On Demand offering and allows us to include Internet video in the Guide, which enhances the value of our service.","Now, because the Guide is cloud-based and will work across nearly all of our 10 million set-top boxes, we can launch and refresh the Guide without purchasing or installing new set-top boxes. By avoiding deployment of new boxes, Spectrum Guide minimizes customers' disruption and accelerates the time to put a modern UI on every outlet.","It turns every TV into a connected Smart TV and allows us to integrate third-party video services, including over-the-top providers, like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, giving customers the ability to search and view all the content they're interested in without changing consumer-owned hardware or devices. We're also designing Spectrum Guide for dynamic ad insertion as a way to enhance targeting and enable programmers to reduce ad loads with less revenue risk.","Over the course of 2016, we'll also expand our On Demand library with thousands of additional titles and we'll continue to improve our capabilities on additional devices with further live on-demand downloadable content to go. And in the Internet, we're beginning to roll out our Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to residential customers when they're outside the home. All of these product improvements and enhancements will be offered to Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers, so they will fully benefit from the collective product development of these three companies.","Turning to our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, we've made good progress in working with the regulators and other stakeholders financing the transactions and planning the integration. We've met the closing conditions for franchise approvals, and at the federal level we continue to work closely with the FCC and DOJ to make sure they have the information they need; and we remain hopeful that the process can be completed in March.","In January, we received approval for our transactions from the New York State Public Service Commission and, at the state level, we're still waiting on New Jersey, Hawaii, and California. We will continue to work with state authorities to achieve a faster timeline as we have 90,000 employees waiting to become part of the new company, and we don't want to delay the significant consumer benefits that our transactions deliver.","From a balance sheet, employee and operational perspective, we're ready to close. In early November, we completed the process of placing our acquisition financing in the debt markets and have additional financing commitments if needed. We're making good progress on integration plans, focusing on organizational structure and systems, all digital, new pricing and packaging, Spectrum Guide and Worldbox rollouts.","Our integration planning and investments, including in-sourcing of various IT product and service platforms, will allow us to project uniform pricing, packaging and services across a national footprint, which will accelerate the integration of the three companies. Those cloud infrastructure investments include a billing isolation layer, a new provisioning architecture, and a unified biller-agnostic customer service platform in call centers and in the field.","These investments will help to simplify product, standardize service interactions in a consistent way without the time, cost and risk of migrating multiple third-party platforms. These transactions bring significant benefit to all of our stakeholders. For consumers, these transactions will mean better products at better prices with high-quality service, and our new company will be a significant contributor to the continued development of our national broadband infrastructure by bringing faster Internet speeds to more homes in more places with pro-consumer practices. We look forward to closing shortly so that we can produce the transaction benefits to the communities we serve.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. I mentioned on our last call that we've migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers in advance of closing and dual report last quarter and this quarter. The results we issued today in our press release and trending schedule present our residential customer results using the doors methodology. Our SMB video customers are now based on relationships instead of EBUs, and we separately report Enterprise PSUs to reflect our recent organizational changes.","Our P&L presentation similarly separates SMB revenue from Enterprise revenue and, obviously, our new presentation approach does not impact our overall financial results. The customer PSU revenue and adjusted EBITDA trends that you see under the new methodology used today are very similar to the trends that you would see under the previous methodology. In fact, pages 2 and 4 of today's trending schedule provide our results under the prior presentation methodology as well to provide a transparent transition.","So starting with slide 8 of today's presentation, during the fourth quarter we grew Residential PSUs by 191,000 versus 151,000 last year. And in video, we added 29,000 residential customers versus a loss of 3,000 last year.","In residential Internet, we added 115,000 customers, and we grew residential voice customers by 47,000. Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 294,000 or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU is up by 2.3%, driven by a larger Triple Play base and step-ups, loss (13:41) rate adjustments, partially offset by continued Single Play Internet growth.","As slide 10 shows, our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year Residential revenue growth of 7.2% compared to 8.3% last year as we had lower rate increases in 2015.","In Commercial, we added 28,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year, and that improvement is being driven by a greater focus on customer types following the separation of our SMB and Enterprise groups, and by the launch of new pricing and packaging to the SMB marketplace in early 2015.","Total Commercial revenue grew by approximately 12%, continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure that we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in the middle of 2012.","Our advertising revenue is down about 19% year-over-year, driven by a $16 million decline in political in the fourth quarter, given last year's election cycle. In total, our fourth quarter revenue was up by 6.4% year-over-year; 7.6% excluding advertising. And for the full year, as Tom mentioned, we grew our revenue by 7.1%; 7.7% excluding advertising.","In dollar terms, revenue grew by nearly $650 million. If you exclude advertising, 2015 revenue grew by $678 million, more than the $645 million in 2014. So we're pleased with the continued increase in revenue, especially when you consider that we took more modest rate increases than in 2014. Most of our 2015 revenue growth came from customer relationship growth.","Turning to fourth quarter operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on slide 11, total operating expense grew by $89 million, or 5.9% year-over-year, with transition OpEx accounting for $22 million of our total OpEx this quarter. These types of costs will eventually become integration costs post-closing.","Excluding transition, total expenses grew by 5.3%. And on a full year basis, again, excluding transition, our expense base grew by $372 million year-over-year; that compares to $433 million in 2014. So if you step back, we're growing more dollars of revenue with less dollars of expense growth.","Back to fourth quarter expenses, programming expense grew by $49 million, accounting for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 7.9% increase in fourth quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers, and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers.","Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, and network operating cost, was flat year-over-year despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.6%. We continue to get more efficient with lower service transaction volumes.","Other costs grew by $28 million, or about 15% year-over-year, and that's driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, which includes the in-sourcing of IT and software development resources and Enterprise, as well as property taxes on previous CapEx and higher casualty claims due to more in-sourced employee base. Excluding transition-related expenses, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% year-over-year, which exceeds our revenue growth. Keep in mind that fourth quarter 2014 also benefited from political advertising.","Moving to slide 13, fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $548 million, with $49 million related to M&A transaction spend for the activities Tom covered. Those platform investments began with the Comcast transactions and have provided us a head start to provide a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers post-closing.","Excluding all digital and transition CapEx in both periods, our fourth quarter CapEx was up by just over $24 million or 5%. That's driven primarily by investments in product development and timing.","For the full year 2015 and when excluding transition CapEx, our CapEx totaled $1.725 billion, as expected. In 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and acquisitions, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline year-over-year for Charter on a standalone basis.","Fourth quarter free cash flow totaled $80 million, just below last year's level, and the modest decline was driven by the impact of transition OpEx, CapEx and, the largest and most obvious one being, the interest related to our acquisition financing.","For the full year, our reported free cash flow grew to approximately $550 million, up from $170 million last year, with adjusted EBITDA up, CapEx down, a positive working capital contribution offset by transaction and transition costs. And as Tom mentioned, excluding the impact of our transactions specifically in \u2013 for the full year, $72 million of operating expense, $115 million of CapEx, $260 million cash interest and $70 million of transaction cost and other expenses, our 2015 full year free cash flow adjusted for the transaction spend was over $1 billion and over $9 per share.","At December 31, our leverage ratio was 4.1 times on an LTM basis, so we've reached the low end of our target leverage range of 4 times to 4.5 times.","In November, we issued $2.5 billion of high yield notes to help finance our proposed transaction with TWC. And that placement combined with the $19.3 billion of financings that we completed in July and August totals the $21.8 billion of debt that we have in escrow on the balance sheet to finance our transactions.","So we fully placed all the financing for our transactions in the debt markets assuming that TWC shareholders elect the $100 cash option. At close, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5 times or lower. That 4.5 times leverage is based on the New Charter's 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and also includes $500 million of year-one synergies.","Similar to Charter today, New Charter will be in a position to mechanically de-lever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. Our target leverage for New Charter will remain 4 times to 4.5 times, but we will look to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range. And we're committed to maintaining an investment grade index rating at the secured level with first lien leverage under 3.5 times.","To the extent that the $115 cash election were chosen by TWC shareholders, we also have a $4.3 billion high-yield bridge in place to cover our needs. We should mention, this morning we launched a $1.5 billion 144a offering, the proceeds of which we intend to retain until the TWC shareholder election and closing.","Turning to our tax assets on slide 15, at the end of the year we had $8 billion of tax basis in our assets and $11.3 billion in NOLs, for a total of $19.3 billion in tax assets, about $700 million more than we had at the end of 2014. The year-over-year increase in the total tax assets was primarily driven by our previously disclosed partnership liquidation that we executed in the third quarter.","Some of our tax basis also moved over to the NOL bucket in the course of 2015, given regular depreciation and amortization, utilization and bonus depreciation and accelerated tax benefits related to new tangible property regulations.","The net present value of those tax assets are worth well over $3 billion today, and the combined tax assets for New Charter will be worth well over $6 billion in NPV for the reasons we've highlighted previously. We don't expect New Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018 and, even then, at a significantly reduced cash tax rate for several years.","Operator, we're ready for questions, now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","John, are you there?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Operator, why don't we move on to the next one and, if John comes back on, we'll take him in the following question.","Operator","Thank you. Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Tom, you mentioned pricing being flat in 2016 versus 2015. I think, Chris, you said there were modest increases in 2015 over 2014, so I just want to make sure that we heard this right. There won't be any rate increases across your products in 2016. That's the first question.","And then, Chris, you gave us CapEx, sort of a light guide for 2016. Anything on programming costs you can tell us, either to be aware of seasonally by quarter or a growth rate? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Marci, there are no material rate increases in 2016 planned...","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And that's been consistent, correct?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. On programming cost, we don't typically give guidance. We're not going to do it today. But I think what I would say is that the back half of last year you saw a continued high amount of programming cost increase, but at a lower rate than it had been; and that's kind of where we are today. So, for Charter on a standalone basis, of course, that's not where we intend to be. We're in that range that you're seeing in the financials today.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Then I have one follow-up on the sub results. I'm assuming this is due to better churn. That's kind of been consistent across what we've heard from Time Warner Cable and Comcast. Any comment on churn versus gross adds?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our gross adds are up and our churn is down, both.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Tom, just maybe a quick comment. We heard more clarity coming out of Comcast yesterday regarding the spectrum auction. Your thoughts on that auction going into 2016? And then, maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing with respect to off-promo churn. It seems like those customers are not churning. I just wanted to verify that. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Well, with regard to the auction, we're not in exactly the same place as Comcast because we have this pending transaction. And at this point, we can't be assured of what our footprint is. And so, it's difficult for us to participate in the auction without regulatory clarity.","And we haven't \u2013 for instance, even in the Time Warner assets and Bright House assets, we know there's an MVNO, but we haven't actually seen it. And so, we have a lot of unknowns in terms of our ability to participate. We've considered participating by filing \u2013 potentially filing the application. But if the timeline is as projected, we're not going to really be able to do it, given our regulatory status.","With regard to off-promo churn, we have been reducing our churn throughout the year as a result of the quality of our products, and our off-promo churn is not inconsistent with that general trend.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Can you guys talk a little bit about the revenue drivers for 2016 versus prior years, since you're not taking a rate increase? In other words, do you expect to get more volume, because you typically put a price increase and you're not going to, so the revenue growth will be shifted more to volume in 2016, and maybe any more color on your decision process there? And then, I just was wondering if you could talk about DOCSIS 3.1 and sort of what the technology road map looks like for Charter in deploying that across at least the standalone footprint? Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, Ben, if you take a step back at the high level, 2015 had very little in the way of price increases as well; so 2016 is not going to be that dramatic. The reality is if you're growing your residential customer base at 5%-plus, there's not much that you need to be doing on the rate side and you can be extremely competitive and go to grow and provide value to consumers.","So, 2016, we have more momentum than the marketplace than we did coming into 2015, and there's even less need than in the past to have to take rate increases. You also have SMB and Enterprise, which right now you've seen a decelerating trend on revenue growth, but an accelerating trend on PSU growth. And we'd expect that over time, SMB and Enterprise would perform a lot like Residential did in the late 2012-2013 timeframe. And our goal is to reaccelerate the growth for revenue, not just customers and PSUs on that side as well.","Clearly, we're in a political advertising year as well, and sometimes that's unclear how much of that is going to flow to you. But similar to what we've done in prior years, we'll always isolate that political advertising, so people have clarity around it so that they can isolate the growth rates in the good and in the bad. So we'll be doing that throughout the course of this year as well. So I don't think that \u2013 to put it bluntly, I don't think that a lower amount of rate increase really has a dramatic impact because of our improved ability to grow.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. Anything on 3.1?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. With regard to 3.1, we didn't specifically plan for it in legacy Charter in this fiscal year, but the modems will become available commercially later this year and we think that it's possible that we'll start to deploy those modems in lieu of 3.0 modems; but we don't have a specific plan to do that, yet. But over the next 18 months, this platform is going to become available to the industry at commercially deployable pricing, and we expect that we will begin the transition in the new company over that timeframe.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ben. Kim, next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with Moffett. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Tom, I wonder if you could just update us on the rollout of your Spectrum Guide, your sort of, I guess, IP-agnostic or legacy set-top-box-agnostic Spectrum Guide, and whether you can update the timing of when that will be fully deployed to your footprint?","And then, Chris, if you could comment on the longer-term capital intensity outlook with that platform; capital intensity hasn't really come down quite as quickly as we would have expected. I think, longer term, your guidance has suggested that it come down well below 15%. I wonder if you could just kind of put some numbers around that in broad terms, if you could.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So with regard to the guide, we're rolling it out now and we have the ability to roll it out inside our own footprint this year, meaning the existing footprint. The transition process of integrating the other companies and building a game plan to roll it out is going to take longer. And so, we will not \u2013 assuming we close sometime in the near future on those companies, we're not going to get them completely rolled out this fiscal year, but I think we can begin the process by the end of this year.","The big issue, interestingly, we've gotten all the bugs that we think could exist out of this system and it works very well. The choice before us will be do we roll it out on every outlet in mass, or do we roll it out incrementally to just new customers, and then begin to make it optional to existing customers? And the tension there is that there's some people that just are confused by new user interfaces and you have to manage that process of the customer education, as well as the desire to get a highly functional UI out in front of everyone simultaneously.","So we're still wrestling with the right rollout strategy, but, operationally, it works very well and it's capable of being fully deployed.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Craig, on capital intensity, you're right. A lot of people focus on CPUs being one of the big drivers, and it is primarily because it's the easiest to model. So the drivers around that are \u2013 once you've gone all-digital, you need less CPE per transaction. So just by going all-digital on a go-forward basis, you require less CPE for every (31:47).","The second element is that we're buying boxes at dramatically lower prices, well over a 50% reduction from where we were buying that. That's being driven by the introduction of Worldbox, but even the path to getting to Worldbox produced those type of prices for us. And by extending the life of CPE through Spectrum Guide, that obviously has a big impact on capital intensity.","The pieces that are, in some respects, even more material, but harder to model, include that the business is increasingly becoming more cloud-based. And by developing and putting platforms in the cloud as opposed to at the local level, you can think of video-on-demand as just one type of example, you can get better scale on any cable system by doing that and become more efficient from a capital perspective.","Another area that's also harder to model is that, today, when you take a look at TWC, Charter and Bright House, three companies doing their own development and building and standing up of platforms, whether that's data centers or product development or IT platforms, and that gets to be done in a single instance as opposed to three different times of it. There's a benefit to the transaction of putting these three companies together and being able to develop faster and at a cheaper cost per passing or per dollar of revenue.","And the final one \u2013 I think this is the one that's probably the most misunderstood. I think you're referencing the proxy statement that we had that had CapEx forecast is, simply, when you have higher revenue growth \u2013 and if you take a look at our results today, when you have higher revenue growth, you have a higher dollar value of revenue per passing in an environment where a good portion of your capital expenditure is fixed capital spend.","And so, simply by growing revenue faster, you can drop your capital intensity by having a better utilization of a fixed set of assets and a fixed capital cost. And so, that's the piece that I think that's the most misunderstood is in those proxy statements, which I'm not sitting here and reiterating today, although we were intelligent when we put them together, the reality is those CapEx dollars weren't decreasing. The capital intensity was declining significantly for all the reasons I mentioned, but a big driver of that is simply being able to drive higher revenue growth on a fixed set of passings.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And one more item is that if you reduce operating expenses by reducing transactions, the capital infrastructure that supports the operating expenses is also reduced.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's helpful. Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Same applies to EBITDA as well, and why you can grow your EBITDA at even faster rate than revenue from the same principles.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Kim, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Tom, you sort of mentioned that you had hopes that the deal could close in March, and we read that the California PUC is holding out for a later date; and I understand you've have some meetings there. Any color you can share on that discussion?","And then, on \u2013 just your view on the FCC's attempt of introducing this AllVid ability for customers to buy boxes elsewhere and what that means, especially within the context of your Worldbox initiatives. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Well, with regard to the regulatory approval process, we're reasonably confident that the FCC and DOJ are on track to stay within the shot clock that they imposed on themselves, and that they're committed to that. And we are trying to move California in, which we think is really the only thing that would extend it out. And so, we've petitioned that California move us up in their docket and we have yet to hear on whether that's going to happen or not.","With regard to AllVid type \u2013 we haven't seen the proposal, yet, really fully, but we think it's a very dynamic marketplace and that the business is moving toward app-based display and cloud-based display, and that we'll want to work carefully with the FCC as they attempt to change the marketplace as it currently exists.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. Two quick questions, if I may. On your cost to serve customers, they were sort of flat year-over-year. Have we gotten to a point where you've put all of the infrastructure in place that you need for the existing Charter business and you should start seeing operating leverage on that cost base? And we notice sort of the same trend with selling expenses as well.","And the second question was just on the trends we're seeing in broadband subscriber growth for the industry, in general. It's been a phenomenal quarter and just a great year of accelerating growth for the industry. We think that's being driven by strong secular tailwinds. Is there any reason we shouldn't see continued acceleration in growth in 2016? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the cost to serve and selling expenses really ties to some of the financial discussions we've already had in terms of efficiency. And yes, we think that Charter \u2013 standalone Charter continues to get more efficient. And as a result of the infrastructure we've put in place and the practices we've put in place and the changes we've done to our customer service operation, all of which ultimately improve customer life, customer satisfaction and reduce transaction volume in the business, which reduces selling expenses and cost to serve.","Broadband growth, I think, is an opportunity for us. The Charter story, and I think the story for the New Charter, is that it's an underpenetrated business. And if you look at the market share that the Telcos have in Internet service and in \u2013 the satellite companies have in video service and the share that Telcos have in business services, we have a lot of growth in front of us. And we have good products that are driving that growth.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. First, you mentioned that you'll be hiring 20,000 people to in-source functions. Just wondering what the time period is that you'll be ramping up those costs to hire and train these new people before they fully hit the ground running, while at the same time you've got the outsourced labor still doing the day-to-day functions, and how long it takes to really work through that process.","And then, the other question I had was for Chris. Chris, and I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but can you help us just understand better the $1.8 billion increase in the value of the tax loss carry-forwards since last year? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Bryan, the in-sourcing is kind of a proportional analysis of what we've done at Charter over the last four years and how that applies to the assets we're acquiring, given their scale. And in many ways, the level of outsourcing in Time Warner and Bright House is equivalent to what existed insider Charter.","And the time \u2013 you're right. There is a timeline issue there, and there is a moment where you have costs of outsourcing while you're training new people, and you have capital intensity while you're building new call centers and buying trucks and tools and test equipment, all of which we had to do at Charter in order to get the operating model that we're currently enjoying running.","And we'll have the same obligation and the same challenges as we go forward in the new company. But it will result, ultimately, in a higher return on investment than we'd get, otherwise.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And also, the New Charter will have the transaction synergies to help fund and bridge those types of investments going forward.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And it's also fair to say that the new assets have less issues in terms of plant maintenance and other things of that nature that were neglected at Charter because of its bankruptcy. That had to be fixed before we could even begin to improve the customer service.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Bryan, on the tax assets, I did mention a few things in the prepared remarks. We had overall, the tax assets, an increase; and one of the biggest drivers occurred inside of the third quarter where we had the collapse of the partnership, which produced some additional step-up in basis, pretty significant. And then, over the course of the year we had the regular depreciation and amortization and the continued D&A of our excess tax basis.","We also, in a material way, utilized the bonus depreciation, which has now been extended, which isn't something that Charter had historically done a lot of. And we also had tax benefits inside the year due to new tangible property regulations, generally, and some that applied to the cable industry, specifically. And so, as a result of all those factors, we had overall increase in tax assets and we had a shift of what was inside the overall tax basis into the loss carryforward category.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bryan. Kim, next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Good morning. A number of cable operators in the U.S. and Europe have been moving fairly aggressively into customer self-install, which seems to be helping out their financial results. Can you talk about where you guys are on self-install and, broadly speaking, the upside you see from moving more aggressively there? And then, I've got a follow-up.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Jeff, it's Tom. Yeah, we think there's a lot of upside there and none of that has been realized in our current results, and none of that's actually in our models that we presented to you in our proxy. So, that's sort of an added opportunity for us going forward.","We do think that in an all-digital world, you can go to a self-serve \u2013 self-provisioning environment. And one of the things we've been doing is building the infrastructure from a billing and servicing perspective so that we can do that, not just against legacy Charter, but against the new assets as well, and move quickly to a world where customers can go online, order equipment, have it delivered to them, and self-install it because the installation remains hot.","We've also designed some security so that we can ensure the integrity of content, meaning that content goes where it's sold, by designing software that can let us know where boxes are in relationship to each other. And we've begun deploying that software. So, we're ready to go with that over the next year or two, and it will go along with our all-digital project and the \u2013 you'd take a significant amount of churn transactions \u2013 physical transactions out of the business if you get it right.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. And then, the follow-up on the price increase, or the lack of one this year, can you confirm \u2013 you did have a broad cash fee increase in the fourth quarter, and what was \u2013 was that $1, or what was that, if I'm correct?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The whole change was less than 1% of total revenue. I don't know the exact figure.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. But you did have a modest increase in the fourth quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We had a very small increase. It was \u2013 I don't remember if it was $0.70 or something in that category inside of, call it, October. That was a lower amount of increase relative to what it was in Q4 of 2014. So the important thing to keep in mind is, yes, there was a little bit there, but it was lower than it was in Q4 2014.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And later as well, actually.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Kim, next question, please","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. I was amused with your letter to customers regarding the Time Warner Cable price increase and I wonder if you can help us think about where your sort of \u2013 where the net prices are for different types of customers today, yours versus Time Warner Cable, and \u2013 as well as sort of how things are billed and how we should think about the transition of Time Warner Cable revenue as you move those new prices through over the next year. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know what letter you were referring to \u2013 to Time Warner customers. We didn't send any letter to our customers that I'm aware of.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wasn't there an open letter to Time Warner customers after their price increase?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It wasn't from us.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm sorry. I'm confused.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, Time Warner Cable is still an independent company and, if they sent a letter to their customers, I didn't see it.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So maybe just the net question, anyway, on pricing, how \u2013 yours versus Time Warner Cable.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","How we'd transition post-close.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","How do we transition post-close, or what's the difference between us and them?","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What's the difference between you and them for a similar type of customer, and how do you transition that over the next year?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, our plan is to move Time Warner and Bright House customers into our model, like we did legacy Charter into our model of building high-quality products at good prices and having customers move into those price and package scenarios based on their voluntary desire to get all the new service and functionality that we've put into those products.","And so, we'll build a similar model inside of Time Warner and Bright House going forward. And as a result of that, we expect to accelerate growth in those markets and generate the kind of returns that we have forecasted. That's the basic notion.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, should we expect some revenue disruption during that period?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We will, I think, have a similar outcome as to what we've had in Charter over the last four years.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Phil, if you go back at the time, all the way back to late 2012 when we came out and told the market what we were doing with new pricing and packaging, in essence, we told people that we were going to take pricing down on every single one of our products. We were going to invest more in service and we were going to invest more in every transaction by putting more equipment and gear into the home. And that's how we were going to make money, which is a little bit counterintuitive until you think about the fact, by lowering the pricing on every single one of your product, you have the opportunity to sell more over time and get more revenue per household and get more efficient for all the reasons that we talked about.","So we told people at the time that success would be defined by an accelerating amount of customer relationship growth, better sell-in to multiple products in the household, PSU growth as a result. And then, several quarters on, you'd see a reacceleration of the revenue growth which would be stunted short-term by putting in the high-value pricing and packaging. And then, over time you'd see EBITDA growth and a reduction of capital intensity; all of which you've seen at Charter, and it does provide the baseline model.","The differences being, going forward, is we think we can do it faster because of the status of where TWC and Bright House are already at in terms of the quality of the plant and some improvements even in the past year, and the fact that we'll have transaction benefits, as a result, that can be reinvested into the business along the way to bring better products faster to the TWC and Bright House customers.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Phil. Kim, next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Tom, can you just talk about the evolution of the bundle? And, I guess, Triple Play penetration has been growing nicely, both at Time Warner Cable and Charter, but how might that change as skinny bundles gain traction, or perhaps standalone Internet packages? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you could still have Triple Play in a skinny bundle world. Triple Play refers to voice, data and video. And so, you could \u2013 if one could comprise or build skinny bundles that worked in the marketplace in a significant way, meaning customers adopted them, kept them and were happy with them, you could still build packaged products that would make sense for consumers. So I don't think it has any direct impact on Triple Play potential or any other bundled potential.","That said, you know, 96% of our customers are still Expanded Basic customers. So it's a \u2013 the big package is still what most people take in our markets today and if, in fact, programmers allow their content to be sold in skinny bundles, which I think would be very consumer-friendly, you could still build high quality packages that would work in the marketplace, in my opinion.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Kim, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Question, two quick ones, if I could. First of all, on set-top boxes, you mentioned bringing in Internet video into the fold as well. Were you talking about OTT services? And given that, how important do you think cross-platform search is to be able to make such an integration work?","And secondly, you mentioned on video gross ads being up. How much of that do you think is the pool of gross ads are up or improved versus your share of the pool of gross ads are up? And for churn, any color on \u2013 any shifts where the video disconnect are going? Are they competitive services or just dropping video entirely? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. There's a lot in that question. Yes, I think cross-platform search would be consumer-friendly. Almost all of our customers \u2013 the vast majority of our customers subscribe to us and over-the-top services, and we want our customers to be fully satisfied in their video experience and have that to be as seamless an experience as possible.","And therefore, given the movement to On Demand programming and the volume \u2013 the sheer volume of products available, you need to be able to search and find and discover products in a much more efficient way than people have historically stumbled on to television. And that's why we're building the UI we're building; and it's fully capable of doing cross-platform search. There are business issues around that that we're working through with parties, but it's what customers deserve.","With regard to gross ads and the share where they're coming from, I'm not sure whether the economic or the macroeconomic situation has changed at all, because growth rates in the country for all MVPDs \u2013 we think that in our \u2013 where we operate, our video share is about 50%. And so, we think that we have a tremendous upside to grow our own business with the quality of video services that we can build and provide, and with the service infrastructure we've built around that.","I do think \u2013 we've talked about the macro issues, previously, and the pressures on video, most of which I think are economic. The costs have been high. It does look like costs have moderated a little bit on the margin, and that's partially because over-the-top is affecting the value of content in a good way, from our perspective. And so, I'm not \u2013 we'll have to look at the macro trends, but in terms of what our growth opportunities are, our biggest growth opportunity is to take video share from existing providers assuming that we had better products and services.","James M.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn today's call over to our host, Mr. Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Charter's 2013 second quarter earnings call. This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risks factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Please also note that all 2012 growth rates noted on this call are pro forma for certain acquisitions and divestitures, as if they occurred on January 1, 2011.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our Investor & News Center. The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Stefan. Charter's customer growth and recurring revenue growth accelerated in the second quarter. We've made significant progress in creating a superior product and service offering using our inherent network advantages and improved our execution on fundamentals. Our total revenue grew by 4.7% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of advertising revenue, second quarter 2013 revenue grew by 5.7% year-over-year. Our second quarter residential revenue growth rate was 4.3% versus growth of 2.6% last year, and our first half 2013 residential revenue growth rate was more than double the 2012 growth rate. Commercial services continue to perform very well, with over 20% revenue growth in the quarter, and our pipeline for future growth remains strong. Our total customer and PSU results improved this quarter, with year-over-year net add improvements in all residential and commercial categories. Total residential customer relationships grew by 5,000 during the quarter versus a loss of 17,000 a year ago. We also gained 38,000 residential PSUs during the quarter versus a loss of 31,000 during the same period last year. And expanded basic video customers grew by 23,000 in the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was virtually flat year-over-year, and reflects the change in operating practices and upfront investments we are making to accelerate the growth of our business. So our short-term adjusted EBITDA results reflect our plan. More important is the operating progress we're making, which positions us to win market share and grow cash flow per home passed.","Consistent with the strategy we outlined last year, we've made a number of changes to: one, our core product offering; two, how we go to market with that product; and three, how our business is organized, all to drive deeper penetration of our products and services. We've actively invested in our 2-way interactive high-capacity cable plant in order to provide a superior offering in the vast majority of our footprint. Over 65% of our Internet customer base now receives data speeds of 30 Mbps or higher. We're committed to a video product, as it remains a critical marketing tool in the financial underpinning to provide all our services in the home profitably. We now offer over 100 high-definition channels in virtually all of our markets versus an average of 75 HD channels per market just over 12 months ago, and with Video On Demand on every outlet. And ultimately, we'll be all HD once we have gone fully digital.","Digital sell-in to new video connections is now 99% and digital penetration of our existing base of customers is over 90%. The launch of our all-digital product in our Fort Worth, Texas footprint is now complete. Our customers in Fort Worth area now have access to over 140 HD channels on a fully functioning 2-way digital set-top box, with Video on Demand and a fully-interactive program guide on every television in the home. Nearly 30% of the spectrum in our Fort Worth plant is now empty, allowing us to ultimately offer all content in HD, more Video on Demand and super fast Internet speeds. The all-digital launch went very smoothly in Texas and taught us what we need to know to take all of our other markets all digital by the end of the year 2014.","Over the last year, we've reorganized all of our sales channels and commission structures. Our direct sales channel is nearly fully staffed, and we've also completed the reorganization of all of our inbound sales and retention channels. The progress is beginning to show in our results. Total connect volume was higher this quarter than last year, and we're now selling more video in customer relationships, and we continue to improve.","55% of our video sales now take triple play. At the end of the second quarter, 54% of our residential customers were on our new pricing and packaging structure, meaning that over half of our customers are receiving a superior product set with far more value on every outlet and every device in the home.","We also have completely reorganized our service operations. Our new regional management structure focuses exclusively on the physical transactions and outside plant maintenance, and we're investing in previously-deferred plant maintenance and quality assurance. We centralized network operations so that we can more quickly implement product changes across our network and maintain consistent service quality. Call centers have been reorganized to build expertise in specific locations across our national footprint, and we're increasingly in-sourcing both our field operations and call center workforce in order to improve quality.","In turn, our service metrics are showing significant improvement. Trouble call rates fell by 14% year-over-year in the second quarter, while repeat truck rolls fell by 16%. Ultimately, these improving service metrics will result in lower churn. And through churn reductions, we'll grow our market share faster.","As I've said before, these goals of these fundamental product selling and service changes are to drive deeper penetration of our services into the home, with a simple transparent and high-value offer structure: drive higher ARPU per connect, which will increase over time with built-in price steps; lower our transaction costs per customer; and extend customer life through lower churn, all designed to grow market share, increase cash flow and drive return on investment.","Looking forward, we have some new products under development. We continue to make progress on developing a cloud-based user interface that will move key product and service functionality out of the set-top box and into our network. The objective is to provide a consistent cloud-based interface across all devices and avoid customer disruption by making existing equipment work without additional capital spend for replacement CPE. We also gain speed to market.","We're building capabilities internally and working with various vendors as we bring our concepts out of the lab and into the field. Later this year, we plan to launch our companion remote application, which will allow for the streaming of linear video inside the home to smartphones and tablets. We also recently relaunched a $3 per month WiFi service on a stand-alone router that we'll be able to service remotely.","So overall, I'm pleased with where the operations stand today. There's still a lot of activity taking place to improve our processes, but our more centralized approach to our operation is now in place to deliver a superior customer experience. Our progress is also already visible in improving PSU and revenue growth, and we expect that to continue, with cash flow to follow. We are executing well on the plan we laid out over the last year and we remain focused on our key objectives.","Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to give additional details on the second quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. When we implemented our new strategies last year, we articulated a sequence of how we would see success develop in our metrics. Let me again highlight that sequence and our status: first, through the quality of PSU growth, which we've seen through extended basic video, triple play and from penetration growth; second, through residential customer ARPU in accelerating year-over-year residential revenue growth, which started in Q4 and continued through the first half of this year; and ultimately, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, where we expect a meaningful first comparison once we have a full year of the same strategy and product offering in place.","As a result of our improved product and marketing practices, our basic losses have improved. Looking at Slide 3, you'll see that we lost 48,000 video subscribers during the quarter versus 66,000 during the second quarter of last year. But more important than the overall improvement in basic video is the fact that our expanded basic video customers continue to grow. We grew expanded basics by 23,000 during the quarter and our total video losses continue to be driven by limited basic. We now have less than 270,000 limited basic customers, and our expanded basic customers make up over 93% of our total video customer base.","We also added 40,000 Internet customers during the quarter versus 29,000 last year. And the clearest indicator of our triple-play progress is our phone net add results, where we added 46,000 during the quarter versus 6,000 a year ago.","In line with that offer structure is our residential revenue per customer relationship growth, which was up 2.5% in the second quarter versus last year. Net-net, the result is that residential revenue grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which is a 65% improvement in terms of growth versus the second quarter of last year.","As Slide 4 indicates, our commercial business had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year and over 25% excluding video. Commercial PSU net adds also improved. We added 16,000 commercial PSUs this quarter versus 8,000 a year ago. And so commercial remains a key focus for us. There's a $9.5 billion B2B telecom market in our footprint, and we're only capturing some $800 million of that spend per year. We remain confident in the current growth trajectory.","Advertising revenue sales fell by 16% in the quarter, driven by a decline in political, the elimination of some barter revenue, which was offset in OpEx, and a decline in contractual revenue. Core advertising growth, excluding these impacts, rose by 1.7% year-over-year.","So in total, our revenue grew by 4.7% year-over-year or 5.7% excluding advertising. And if you focus exclusively on recurring subscription revenue, which we do, our revenue grew by 6.2% year-over-year.","As Slide 5 shows, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat year-over-year. In simple terms, we grew revenue by $88 million relative to the second quarter of last year, while our cost grew by $89 million, driven by the following: $46 million of the cost increase or 52% of the total was in cost to service customers, reflecting the change in our operating practices to drive higher quality service. This includes quality control personnel and practices, previously-deferred plant maintenance, establishing new regional management structure and in-sourcing, offset by lower contract labor.","Marketing costs grew by $9 million, while commercial costs grew by $8 million, which together accounted for 19% of the total annual cost increase. The marketing expense in Q2 reflects the reorganized sales channels, which by the end of the quarter, were essentially delivering higher video and triple-play sales across every channel versus the prior year.","Programming expense grew by $27 million or 5% year-over-year and reflects the remaining 30% of the overall cost increase. That equates to 5.7% per expanded basic video customer. We expect full year 2013 programming expense growth in the mid- to high-single digits on a per expanded basic customer basis.","So what's the best way to think about the operating cost structure as we look forward? I'll go in reverse order the 3 buckets I just described. Clearly, programming is a broader industry issue, but relative to our competition, we remain well positioned. We have a multi-product residential and commercial offer structure, which is underpenetrated in nearly every market. So we can still grow both adjusted EBITDA and margin across our product set.","Second, marketing and commercial expenses are areas we hope will continue to increase, with growth.","Finally, the increase in cost to service customers is a bit more nuanced. Our quality control personnel and practices and regional management structure are now established from an expense perspective. The onetime catch-up of our deferred maintenance program is complete. And while the program is now more frequent, it should be lower than the second half of last year. Continued efforts to in-source more of our field operations and call center labor will continue over time.","So the key operating expense point is our year-over-year comparison should be more relevant, starting in the third quarter. An even bigger point is that we're delivering a much higher quality product and service to our customers, which means you can invest significantly more in quality per transaction, but have lower operating costs through lower service calls, truck rolls, downgrades and churns. As Tom mentioned, we're already beginning to see the benefits from trouble call rates and repeat truck rolls falling substantially year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 6, we spent $422 million of capital during the second quarter or 21% of revenue versus 25% of revenue during the second quarter of last year. We now expect 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.8 million, including the impact of the Bresnan acquisition, which closed on July 1.","Since I mentioned Bresnan, our third quarter results, when we provide those, will include the performance there as well as. We intend to provide pro forma data for the prior periods, so again[ph] , in growth rates for both financials and operating metrics.","Looking to the balance sheet. We feel very good about the liquidity, total leverage and the various debt transactions we've completed so far this year. On our last quarterly call, we highlighted most of our recent debt transactions. So instead of reviewing each individual transaction here, please refer to Slide 8, which provides a comprehensive list, including the Bresnan acquisition and its associated financing. Slide 8 also provides an updated maturity profile for Charter pro forma for the Bresnan financing.","Our weighted average borrowing cost is now 5.6% and over 95% of our debt matures beyond 2016, and our maturity profile and balance sheet are well positioned to help drive our triple-play growth strategy. Our target leverage remains unchanged, and we continue to believe that our best ROI approach to the use of our free cash flow is the right way to allocate capital.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom for some final remarks.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Chris. Before moving on to Q&A, as Chris mentioned, last month, we closed on the acquisition of Bresnan from Cablevision. And the integration of Bresnan's customers and employees is going well. On a related note, clearly, we are aware of all the press surrounding M&A speculation, and we will not be answering any questions surrounding that speculation on this call, other than to generally say that we believe in the benefits of consolidation, including significant opportunities for cost and tax synergies, and more importantly, the ability to grow assets organically at a faster pace. And while I think these principles could be applied across a number of assets with very attractive returns, we remain focused on the core opportunity at Charter today, and we'll continue to be very disciplined around M&A opportunities when and if they arise.","Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak of Pivotal Research Group.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Jeff Wlodarczak. Part of the Charter EBITDA acceleration story is leveraging your improved product, customer service, triple-play to accelerate your RGUs. That's working very nicely. The next step seems to be raising prices, consumers coming off promotions. You feel like the more aggressive promotions from AT&T, in particular, as of late, have materially affected your ability to reprice consumers coming off promotional periods? And then I had one follow-up.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, Jeff, this is Tom. We think that our pricing strategy is working, will work, and we don't see anything that's going to throw us off track with our pricing strategy in the marketplace currently.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And then how much do you -- how much has AT&T expanded their U-verse service in your footprint and what are your expectations based on their public commentary about where they're going to get to in the future?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Right. Well, we haven't really seen any evidence of any significance that they have expanded in our footprint. And so I've read their public comments and they're fairly convoluted. And their current overlap of our footprint is slightly less than 30%, and we still think that's the right number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question on the cost structure. You guys gave quite a bit of color commentary. But if you sort of roll it all up and you sort of think about the margin trajectory of the business, is it still reasonable to assume that the 3Q margins will probably compress a bit, as they always do seasonally, and then we sort of springboard off of -- from there? Is that sort of a reasonable expectation?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Jason, this is Chris. Yes, Q3, you have typically all of the reconnect activity. So I think one way to think about things is sequentially, and it seems that you're thinking about it that way. The weighted average articulating cost structure is really more from a year-over-year comparability. And a lot of the activity, particularly the acceleration of the deferred plant maintenance, which started in Q3 of last year, has now leveled out. We're doing it more frequently. But at a minimum, from a -- in the short-term perspective, you shouldn't see the same type of acceleration that we've seen in the past. Not going go into margin forecast. We still have a number of changes that are ongoing, including in-sourcing. But all of these have a positive ROI attached to them. And the goal here is not only to return to margin over time, but to be able to provide a better service and product quality, such that you can actually lower the amount of transactions, which of course, over time, will reduce OpEx to provide those transactions. But you made a very good point about the sequential increase that always happens in Q3 for most cable operators as it relates to the back-to-school season, and then onto to the free connect activity that takes place there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik of UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you guys comment on the -- what kind of subscriber growth and revenue growth that you're seeing compared to the broader company in those Texas markets that you've done the all-digital transformation in? And then beyond that, can you give some -- I know you said that you'll be done with the all-digital strategy by the end of 2014. But can you give us a little bit more color on when some of those new markets come online? For instance, when is the next group of markets going to be all digital?","Thomas M. Rutledge","John, this is Tom. The one thing I'll say about Texas is that Texas is growing again in every category of subscriber PSU, and that's the first time Texas has grown in years. So that's a good sign and that's coming as a result of the superior product that we have on the street now in Fort Worth. Additional markets this year will be Los Angeles area systems; Saginaw, Michigan; and Greenville, South Carolina. And then we'll go through the whole company next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett of Moffett Research.","Craig Moffett - Moffett Research, LLC","Let me see if I can squeeze in an M&A question without asking you to comment on anything specific. But do you think you could discuss how you think about smaller transactions rather than larger transactions going forward? Is there a way that you can address the programming cost issues that you've highlighted in the -- in talking about M&A by doing a series of smaller deals? Or do you think it has to be something larger?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Craig, when we looked at Bresnan, we looked at an opportunity to grow our market share, and that is the Charter opportunity, then it's the opportunity for the whole cable industry to take what, I think, is a superior infrastructure and to put products together in that infrastructure that create value for the consumer. And I think that the cable infrastructure that we have at Charter and the cable infrastructure that was in place at Bresnan before we purchased it allows us to do that. That's the single biggest economic driver that we have at our disposal. Beyond that, if you get to a certain scale, you have a different form of leverage in programming negotiations and you could argue about where that is. And it's not just scale, it's also willingness to use that scale to affect your outcome, and how much you need or how big you need to be is a difficult question to answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess 2. So I want to follow up. But first, can you give us a little more detail on your set-top box plans? You talked about the low-end product as sort of bridge. But what about the high-end box? And then second to follow up a little bit on Craig, given your comment on programming, is there a sense of urgency to do deals here? Or is this something that really could take some time? It feels like this industry needs to roll up, but it's felt that way for a long time.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, our box strategy is designed to actually make our boxes a thin-client as opposed to a fat-client box. And the idea of using cloud-based user interfaces allows you to take a server-based architecture and feed existing boxes sophisticated guides that can be changed very inexpensively without changing out the hardware. And as part of our strategy, we received a waiver from the FCC to begin employing a new box that uses traditional, conditional access. And at the end of a 2-year period, we'll be switching to downloadable security, which allows us essentially to buy boxes from anywhere and any vendor and not be locked into legacy conditional access or security systems that are currently -- that currently limit the amount of vendors you can use in a cable system. That, in itself, will allow us to buy lower cost CPE, whether it's high-processing power CPE or low-processing power CPE. In the long run, with smart televisions and smart tablets, which essentially allow the TV or the tablet to operate as a set-top box and a TV combined, we think that incremental CPE will become less and less a factor in our overall capital structure. So we think capital intensity is coming out of CPE, and we have a strategy designed to ensure that happens.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And in terms of urgency on M&A?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I think, as I said to Craig, our big opportunity is to take advantage of our inherent strength and grow our share, and that's what we're focused on. In terms of timing on M&A, I think Charter can be extremely successful without it and potentially, with the right deal, be more -- even more successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, just going back to the Dallas, Fort Worth and the Texas markets, can you talk a little bit about the ARPU benefits you're seeing? I know there are some FCC rules around how quickly you can start charging for boxes. And whether you're seeing any improvement in like operating expense trends, as you've gotten rid of analog and particularly around truck rolls? And then I have a follow-up for Chris.","Thomas M. Rutledge","I don't want to break out Texas specifically. If we are performing better there, from a growth perspective and as a general proposition, Charter operating metrics are improving, service metrics are improving, including how customers perceive our service. And we expect those to exist in Texas. We do expect that the overall perception of quality by customers in an all-digital environment will be enhanced. But I don't have any data specifically to Texas that I want to share with you.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Chris, just on the ARPU front, as we move into Q3, just wondering if you can remind us of the puts and takes that you have. The price increase, which, I think, has been fully implemented now, the 2.3% you called out in prior quarters, plus the beginning of the anniversary of last year's promotion. So maybe what are the other things we should be keeping in mind as we think about the sequencing from Q2 to Q3?","Christopher L. Winfrey","You have -- so you -- let me just rehash what you said for the benefit of others. We did have the enterprise increase that was put through in March. So that's not fully baked in inside of Q2. You also have the fact that we're selling a better product today, which is more bundled. And then you have the anniversary of the first roll-offs, offset by the fact that we were doing roll-offs in the past. We did have promotions in the past. The difference here is that, by having a higher-quality product in the home and a higher amount of bundling and a better device -- and more of those devices, that the ability to retain net revenue, we expect, to be higher. And then the only really minor thing I would highlight is every Q3 is a back-to-school season. So on the margin, your connect volume and the bundle attach rate tends to reflect a little bit of that as well. But the first points I were mentioning, by far, are the most material.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one for Tom and one for Chris. Tom on the cloud-based user interface, some engineers have told us there might be scaling issues with rolling out the thin-box version of a cloud-based service. Is that right? And if so, how do you grapple with that? You just roll it out to your customer base over time? Or do you think you can flip a switch and give it to everybody?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we -- we're still experimenting with our strategy, but we do acknowledge that there are scaling issues. And obviously, you have to overcome those to flip a switch. One of the things we've been thinking about and which we've had some success with trialing is a hybrid approach, where you put some of the guide infrastructure on the box and the existing boxes have guides on them. And you use that as a high-volume function aspect of the guide and put other parts of the guide in the cloud, so that there's less total demand on the scale of the cloud infrastructure. And we've been experimenting with that, and think that, that is an alternative to a complete cloud-based system. And so we'll see which way works best, but we think that we have a way to make it work and be, from a customer perspective, a high-value service.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there any kind of time frame at this point that you could put on when you think you might be able to get something out into the marketplace broadly?","Thomas M. Rutledge","We're, at this point, still in the experimental and testing phase and don't have a launch date.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And then, Chris, if Charter issues shares in an acquisition or acquisitions over time, is there a ceiling above which Charter NOLs will be impacted? Or is there no issue since you already have that first change of control triggered by Liberty?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Well, let me use the change of control that took place from a Section 382 tax perspective already as Liberty. I'd rather not get into scenarios that talk about us issuing additional shares because that's not what's on the plate today. But I think it's a good case when you take a look at what took place. We had over a 3-year period since the first ownership change took place when Charter emerged from bankruptcy, so the second ownership shift change, which when Liberty invested its 27% beneficial ownership, triggered us for the cumulative ownership change exceeding 50%. When that took place, it was happening at a share price value that was above when the first ownership test took place. And as a result of that we had an additional 382 limitation. That is offset by the fact that you have a recapture, effectively, through a higher amount of realized built-in gain that occurs very quickly over time. And because Charter is in a net operating loss position today, as we speak, builds up -- rebuilds very quickly and can use fully the amount of its NOLs over the coming years in the same way and fashion that we always were planning to do so. So as a result, the present value of our NOL and our NOL itself was unimpaired at the end of the day. And I think that's some color that you can think about, different ways where the tax assets remain extremely valuable in the context that you were discussing. In all forms at different M&A transactions, we think our tax assets are highly valuable.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. Because it depends on what you do with your balance sheet at the same time. I get it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft of Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions. Chris, following up on the cost comments, is there a percentage of revenue that you'd expect cost to serve customers to settle in at? Or were you trying say that in the back half of the year, we should start to see some improvement as a percentage of revenue in that line? And then secondly, just wanted to follow up on the limited basic losses. Do you mean that limited basic subs have actually disconnected? Or does it include the limited basic subs that upgraded to a full service package? And maybe there's no difference, but I just wanted to see if you could clarify that.","Christopher L. Winfrey","So let me start with the second point. So limited basic losses includes both disconnects and as well as customers who have moved to expanded. And the first point is cost to serve. Obviously, we think a lot about this, but we're not here today to give the percentage of revenue guidance. What I'm -- what I think we are saying is that we've actually intentionally and in a very focused way made that percent of revenue higher in the short term by investing more cost per transaction, so that you can reduce the amount of follow-up transactions and that you can reduce truck rolls, phone calls, repeat truck rolls and ultimately, churn over time. If you can do that, you can significantly reduce the cost to serve as a percentage of revenue, not only from an expense standpoint but the whole model is driven to drive additional revenue per household. And by virtue of doing that, you almost get there organically, even without some of the benefits that I was describing.","Operator","You have a question from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you comment a little bit on the commercial opportunity? It's a little better than we were expecting there. Is there anything, any particular markets you're seeing some economic strength or just overall execution? And then could you comment a little bit on Comcast's plan to sort of daisy-chain some WiFi hotspots throughout their neighborhood with some new CPE? I would think with your throughput you're putting a new network, that would be an interesting opportunity for you. Just conceptually, how do you think about that concept for your customer?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Don Detampel is with us, who runs our commercial business. Do you want to speak to that, Don?","Donald F. Detampel","Certainly, Tom. So in the commercial sector, we just ran our ninth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus growth. And as Tom mentioned or Chris, I guess, mentioned earlier, we believe we have about a $9.5 billion opportunity within our footprint. We're about $100 million -- or $800 million penetrated into it across all sectors. And we divide the commercial business into small, medium, large businesses, then of course, our carrier segment. We have great opportunity, I think, across all segments and have low penetration. So we see good running room ahead and see no reason why we can't continue to grow at substantial growth rates.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And with regard to your WiFi question, I do think Comcast is doing the right thing with creating a dual SSID approach, which is what I think you're talking about, where the subscriber has their own and the company has another one, which can be used for other kinds of services. That is the opportunity of WiFi. I think the opportunity that the cable infrastructure lends itself to is small cell wireless services, which can have very high capacities. And that can be either unlicensed spectrum, like WiFi or licensed spectrum. And I think in the long run, there's a tremendous business opportunity there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza of CRT Capital Group.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the commercial for a second, because it is growing so well and the opportunity seems to be really big there. Can you give us a sense for what a reasonable market share objective might be and on what kind of time frame? And then what the incremental margin would be on the incremental revenues?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I think we'd rather not.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Anything you can say about what your customers tend to look like? I mean, I know that you break them into different groups, but are you most active in guys that are at single locations or at multiple locations, mostly fewer than 20 employees, that type of stuff?","Donald F. Detampel","This is Don Detampel. There are certain segments where we've done better traditionally. Certainly, the small business segment, those businesses that have less than 20 employees are very much a sweet spot for us and we can easily serve those customer requirements with our co-ax plan. But we've done very well in the large business segment as well, in certain sectors such as education, health care, government, that require more custom fiber networks between locations. Certainly, the carrier segment has been strong, fueled a lot by cell tower backhaul. And I would say that the segment that perhaps we have the most opportunity going forward is the medium business segment, those businesses that have between 20 and 200 employees, where we're now kind of fully building out our product set and going after that segment a bit more aggressively. But we see strong growth opportunity really across all segments.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And then just lastly, does this business tend to be more capital intensive then, as we think about your CapEx plans?","Christopher L. Winfrey","I think it is. But there's very few places inside -- this is Chris. There's very few places inside the businesses that have delivered 20% area growth for the past 9 quarters. So it's going to be more capital hungry along the way. We also have been, along the way, investing in areas that may not initially reflect itself in the revenue. A good example of that is cell backhaul, which Don mentioned. So cell backhaul is about 10% of our revenue inside of commercial. It's about 20% of our revenue growth inside commercial, and it occupies about 1\/3 of our capital expenditure. These are very long contracts and we'll be seeing the revenue benefit from that for a long time to come. And some of that comes in waves. And so the reality is commercial is spending more in capital, and they're doing better. And all of that's good. They're all positive ROI projects, irrespective of the segment which you're looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Senno of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Senno - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just curious, you've grown non-video subs quite a bit. And I was wondering what level of success you've had in converting some of those to double or triple play as you've changed the pricing and packaging and improved the product?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, the -- I think the thing you should consider is that we're in the midst of a lot of change in terms of our subscriber base. But incrementally, the customers that we're adding are taking multiple product sets in greater numbers than they have historically. And the other interesting thing about our current growth is that our expanded basic subscriber growth is actually accelerating and positive. And what that means is, if you think about the multichannel universe, expanded basic is increasing market share of multichannel video. The limited basic service is a broadcast-only service and tends to be part of the historic packages that were put together, that were low-value, low-price packages, and we're transitioning those to high-value, high-quality, relatively high-priced products. And over time, as we move our customer base, the mix of customers taking all of our products, we expect to increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi of S&P Capital.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So first question for Chris, with regard to the -- to your base that's kind of migrating into the new structure, I'm just kind of wondering how high do you think that percentage can go. So I think you said you're now well over 50%. And I'm wondering, ultimately, do you expect your entire base to be fully migrated and over what period? And with regard to that specifically for existing subscribers, what is the trigger event that kind of triggers the migration of these subscribers to your new structure? And I have a follow-up.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tuna. The reality is that you may never get over to 100% on the new pricing and package. There will come a point where certain customers are happy with where they're at. And despite the amount of direct mail that you get to get them to upgrade a product or taking [indiscernible] and wrap rate [ph] pricing. And if that's where they're satisfied, you may not get all the way to 100%. So I don't know if there's a terminal target to do so. And then your question, the second question was how are customers migrating. It's a combination of really seeing the offers that we have in the marketplace that provide a lot more value, more product, more boxes, higher speed. And so you get a call-in [ph] that's taking place there, as well as the retention process that -- at the historical legacy promotions, that as they rolled off, to have an opportunity to take a higher amount of ARPU from our perspective, but a higher bill price from their perspective. And in doing so, take a lot more product along the way and achieve the overall price increase that was originally intended for them to get more value along the way. So those are the kind of the 2-key methods in which people are migrating in.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","That's very helpful. So a quick question for Tom. I did pick up on your comments that your commitment to video remains. And I guess, I was thinking along the lines of the recent comment by Jim Dolan. And clearly, I wanted to get your sense in terms of how the industry has evolved and as to the potential role that video might play over the long term. I presume your comment was related to the short term if -- or medium term. So some clarification along those lines vis-\u00e0-vis how the shift in the industry toward high-speed data potentially as the main product driver.","Thomas M. Rutledge","So what I said was specifically, we're committed to a video product. It doesn't necessarily have to be the one that we currently have or structured the way it currently is. And I think Jim Dolan's comments are correct over some period of time, although the long run is often hard to predict. And how long the long run is, is hard to predict. I tell people the story about how, in 1980, people were talking about the death of broadcasting, and it's still here and we all knew that it would go through a major structural change. But 35 years later -- or 33 years later, yes, there's retransmission consents. But even that didn't occur until relatively recently. So I think that the video product will become an on-demand product over time, and that it will be delivered what looks like stream services today on the Internet. But how that's actually defined or what it -- how that's structured from a rights point of view, I think is open to interpretation and certainly in the control of content providers. So we're committed to a video product. We think that we have a role to play in that world, and we think that we have a network that allows us to follow the development of television wherever it may go.","Stefan Anninger","Okay.

Additionally, all customer and passenger data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on Legacy Company definitions.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Rutledge","Thanks, Stefan. In the first quarter, our primary objective was to continue to integrate our operations and prepare to launch mobile. Our all digital initiative is moving forward is on schedule for completion by this year-end.","At the end of the first quarter approximately 20% Legacy Time Warner Cable and 60% Bright House Networks continue to carry full analog video line ups. With TWC though improving from approximately 40% at the end of the year 2016.","The whole company will be fully digitized by end of this year, as we deploy fully functioning two way digital set top boxes, mostly our Worldbox and all remaining analog TV outlets that we serve. But while all digital is on track, it is disruptive both to our operations and to our customers. It creates large volume of short-term activity, which is inconsistent with our long-term operating strategy, reducing transactional volume.","The all-digital project though is clearly in the long-term interest of our business, it allows us to free up bandwidth and to realize the full potential and capacity of our network as well as further improve video product itself.","In the fourth quarter we prepare the expansion of gigabit speed offering to several new markets and launch those markets just a few days ago. We now offer gigabit service to approximately 23 million passings, approximately 45% of our total footprint and expect to have gigabit service available to virtually all of our footprints by year-end.","Also this month, we raised the minimum spectrum internet speed to 200 megabits in a number of additional markets at no additional costs to customers. We are raising our internet speed faster than originally planned in order to maintain a superior competitive position. We have compressed our capital spend to raise speeds and to launch 3.1 across our footprint and our strategy is working.","In the markets where we launched 100 megabits as our minimum speed, December sales are up turns down net additions have improved year-over-year. Consistent with our experience with previous speed increases. Today over 50% of our internet customers subscribed to peers that provide 100 megabits or more throughput, you don\u2019t offer anything less to new internet customers and it\u2019s now at 200 megabit of minimum offering, nearly a quarter of our footprint.","Rollout of Spectrum pricing and packaging remains on track, as of the end of the first quarter 55% of Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers were in our new Spectrum pricing and packaging, which reflects the pace of integration and migration expected.","Overtime, we expect Spectrum branded products to drive continued higher sales and longer customer lots. In the first quarter we continue to see year-over-year improvement in sales in connect volumes.","Although, higher year-over-year churn offset the higher sales volumes, higher churn has been a result of some customer service system changes we have been making as part of our large and complex integration. While we are executing a billing migration, last year we collapsed 13 service environments based on our billings system into four using our software isolation layer. In 2018 those four service environments were move to two.","That integration execution, which will result in quality uniform services and efficiencies impacted both our customer qualification and collection process. Both resulting in higher non-pay disconnects and bad debt, we corrected those processes however and both non-pays and bad debt should be back to planned levels by the end of the second quarter.","Despite that self-inflected disruption we\u2019ve grown total internet customers by 1.2 million or over 5% in the last year. And in the quarter we grew revenue by 4.9% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA by 6.8% excluding mobile startup costs.","Turning to mobile. We remain on track to launch our new services in middle of this year under our MVNO agreement with Verizon, we recently launched a field trial, which includes 5,000 employees who are going through an end-to-end sales activation of service process in May. And we are building our sales channels and service capabilities including modifying several hundred of our 700 retail stores and setting up the call center environment. Ultimately the goal is to use our mobile service to attract and retain cable bundle multi-product customers.","In the partnership we signed with Comcast last week will accelerate our ability to scale our MVNV service offerings, by stepping into a proven MVNO back office platform. And improve the economics of our emerging mobile business. While our entry into mobile is new, we\u2019re already a wireless operator today with over 250 million authenticated wireless devices connected to our deployed small cell network. ","Our infrastructure design provide us with the unique opportunity to build the businesses based on how consumers use the service, what I\u2019d call an inside out wireless strategy. In addition to the continued advancements in Wi-Fi throughput and latency, we\u2019re testing in various bands including 28 gigahertz and 3.5 gigahertz, which are going well and support our thesis with small cell using unlicensed and licensed spectrum including mid band spectrum like 3.5 gigahertz. ","Working together with our loyal employees and power of terrestrial network and combined with DOCSIS products like Full Duplex and Coherent Optics will allow us to offer high capacity, low latency connectivity products both inside and outside of the home fixed wireless and mobile and with and without our superior video applications.","Ultimately our strength as a connectivity provider comes from our powerful easy to upgrade network. Its unique design allows for the most costs effective deployment of new technologies, which should drive massive increases in the amount of data we drive through that network. And overtime we will open opportunities to new products.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris. ","Christopher Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Before covering our results, a few administrative items; first, we have reclassed all inbound sales and retention expense from costs of service customers, marketing expense for current and prior periods, we already provided a pro forma change schedule in our fourth quarter materials.","Also reminded that when discussing first quarter customer results, I\u2019ll be comparing these results to the first quarter 2017 results that has been adjusted to exclude seasonal program customer activity in the first quarter of 2017 at Legacy Bright House. That comparison is on slide six of today\u2019s investor presentation.","This is the last time we need to compare year-over-year quarters with these adjustments since we are now beyond the one year mark from the seasonal program change. The customer statistics that you see in today\u2019s materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions and in the second quarter of this year we will recap customer sets and our trending schedules using consistent definitions across all three legacy entities.","The largest differences will be in TWC and Bright House classification of customer types, particularly universities, moving between residential today whether reported on a doors basis, commercial accounts where we report on physical sites. TWC and Bright House also reported SMB and enterprise based on billing relationships and these will convert to a physical sites methodology.","When we report our second quarter results, we\u2019ll report on the uniform definitions for Q2, in prior periods with the reconciliation scheduling. In the third quarter this year, I expect we\u2019ll only report consolidated operating statistics and revenue results. At closing, we said, we will report at least five quarters of legacy entity top-line results following the close of our transactions. The second quarter of this year, will be the ninth time we\u2019ve reported legacy entity results.","Finally, starting on January 1st, of this year, we prospectively adopted as these new revenue net recognition standard there are a number of relatively small adjustments in the quarter related to the adoption of the standard both in revenue and expenses, but in total had no material impact to revenue or adjusted EBITDA growth this quarter.","Now, turning to our results and total customer relationships grew by 261,000 in the first quarter, and grew 890,000 over the last 12-months, with 3.1% growth at TWC, 3.4% at Legacy Charter and 4.6% at Bright House. Including residential and SMB video declines by 112,000 in the quarter, internet grew by 362,000 and voice declined by 25,000. 55% in residential TWC and Bright House customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the first quarter.","Customer connects were higher year-over-year, including our new markets, disconnects were also up year-over-year reflecting the non-linear progression of net adds I have often spoke about. TWC was the largest driver of higher year-over-year disconnects. Key drivers for higher non-pay disconnects from integration related system changes that Tom mentioned, where we\u2019ve since conformed the customer qualification and collection process to our standard policy. And non-pay disconnect and the associated bad debt should be back to normal rates by the end of Q2, practically means the beginning of Q3.","We also continued roll-off churn from legacy packages, these factors had a declining impact on our results as the quarter progressed and should continue to have less of a monthly impact as we progress through Q2.","Slide six shows, we grew residential PSUs by 157,000 versus 338,000 last year. Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by 2.3%, pre-deal charter declined by 1.5% and Legacy Bright House video was 0.3% lower year-over-year. In the quarter, TWC residential video customers declined by about 90,000, with higher additions offset by higher non-pay disconnects.","Legacy Charter lost 32,000 residential video customers in the quarter versus a loss of 13,000 a year ago. Additional competitive build-out less year-over-year benefits from a struggling competitor kept sales relatively flat at legacy charter. Bright House video customers were flat during the quarter versus a gain of 13,000 last year.","In residential internet, we added a total of 331,000 customers versus 416,000 last year, with high long pay disconnects for the reasons I mentioned responsible for all of the year-over-year decline in internet net adds at legacy TWC. Total company internet sales were higher year-over-year and in the 17% of our footprint where we offer 200 megabits per second as our minimum speed as at the beginning of Q1, there was year-over-year improvement in both sales and net additions.","As Tom mentioned, we now offer 200 megabits per second is our minimum speed in nearly 25% of our footprint, and we offer gigabit service in approximately 45% of our footprint and expect to have gigabit service available nearly everywhere by the end of 2018. Over the last 12 months, we grew our total residential internet customer base by 1.1 million customers or 4.9% with 4.8% growth at TWC, 4.9% growth at legacy charter, and 5.9% at Bright House.","In voice, we lost 52,000 residential customers versus a gain of 30,000 last year, driven by fewer additions and higher churn of legacy packages and non-pay churn at TWC. As we\u2019ve said before, our progress towards better customer growth will not be linear we do have -- we continue to expect higher sales and better retention over time as a higher portion of our base is now on spectrum, we upgrade our video and internet capabilities, our service delivery platform improves and as we work through our integrations. ","Over the last year we grew total residential customers by 739,000 or 2.9%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.6% year-over-year given the lower rate of SPP migration, promotional campaign roll off and some minor rate adjustments, partly offset by higher levels of internet only customers and better sales with selling at promotional rates.","Slide seven shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 4.8%. Total commercial revenue SMB and enterprise combined grew by 5.3%, with SMB up 4.1% and enterprise up by 7.3%. Excluding cell backhaul and NaviSite, Enterprise grew by close to 11%. Sales are up in both SMB and Enterprise with SMB PSU net adds at TWC and Bright House up over 10% in the first quarter versus last year.","Our revenue growth in the TWC and Bright House markets hasn\u2019t yet followed the unit growth and it won\u2019t until we get the transition to more competitive pricing of both our SMB and Enterprise products.","We expect that ARPU offset will continue through 2018, but the revenue growth will ultimately follow the unit growth. First quarter advertising revenue grew by 5.6% year-over-year, driven mostly by higher political. In total, first quarter revenue for the company was up 4.9% year-over-year and 4.8% when excluding advertising. Looking at total revenue growth excluding advertising at each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 4.6%, pre-deal Charter grew by 5.2%, and Bright House revenue grew by 5.0%. ","Moving to operating expenses on slide eight, in the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $254 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming increased 5.7% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases and renewals, and a higher expanded customer base and mix, partly offset by [technical difficulty] benefit.","Excluding the one-time benefit this year programming would have grown by 6.5% year-over-year or approximately 8% per video customer. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 7%, primarily driven by our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1st, which also re-classed approximately $15 million of costs through this expense line in the quarter.","Cost to service customers grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by the higher bad debt expense for the reasons I described. Excluding the temporary impact of higher bad debt expense we are lowering our cost to service through changes in business practices and seeing early productivity benefits from the sourcing, all while growing our customer base and investing inward in-sourcing and training.","Marketing expenses declined by 1.8% year-over-year as the prior year period included certain transition costs and with or without that affects our marketing and sales expenses are more efficient on higher sales. And all other expenses were up 2.7% year-over-year, driven by higher ad sales costs, enterprise and product development costs offset by lower overhead cost.","Excluding mobile adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.8% in the first quarter, the impact of the new revenue recognition standard and a few one-time and out of period items including the programming item I mentioned essentially offset each other. When including $8 million of clearly defined mobile startup expenses our adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.5%.","Turning to net income on slide nine, we generated $168 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was higher, severance related expenses were lower, we did not have any losses related to the extinguishment of debt as we did last year and we had a gain on financial instruments from currency movements on our British pound debt and the related hedging. Those positive drivers were partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense.","Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion in the first quarter, primarily driven by higher spending on CPEs, scalable infrastructure and support capital. The CPE spend was driven by higher connect volumes, continued migration of legacy customers over to spectrum who were frequently provide with new equipment, we also incurred $186 million of all-digital spend which was primarily into the CPE category.","The increase in scalable infrastructure was related to the timing of video spend and planned product improvements for video and internet including the spending related to DOCSIS 3.1 launches. We also spend more in the support category on vehicles, tools and test equipment, software development and facility spending in each case some in-sourcing, some related to integration.","Given the pace of all-digital DOCSIS 3.1 deployment and our overall state of integration and planning, the ability to spend capital more consistently as compared to last year is in fact a consign. For the full year we continue to expect a cable capital intensity for cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be a bit lower than 2017.","Slide 11 shows, we generated $49 million of negative free-cash flow in the first quarter versus $1.1 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of last year. The decline was largely driven by higher CapEx and working capital timing this quarter, where I provided a fair color on the overall working capital timing last quarter.","The Q1 working capital headroom was primarily driven by the timing of our late fourth quarter CapEx spend, which drove early Q1 cash payments without offsetting intra-quarter CapEx timing. We finished the quarter with $70 billion in debt principal for run rate annualized cash interest expense at March 31st which is approximately $3.8 billion where as our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggest a $3.4 billion annual run rate, that difference is due to purchase accounting.","As at the end of the first quarter, our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4.46 times, within our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. Earlier this month, we issued $2.5 billion worth of 20 and 30 year investment grade notes, which will primarily be used to fund an upcoming maturity.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares in Charter Holdings common units $683 million and the fact that we started the year at the high end of our target leverage range as opposed to increasing our leverage in 2017. Mathematically means, our 2018 buybacks will be less than 2017, same as I mentioned on last call.","We may also reduce our cable leverage somewhat over the course of the year to ensuring that consolidated EBITDA remains at or under 4.5 times. Beyond the starting point leverage, other factors also play a role in the amount of 2018 versus 2017 buybacks, including the early pace of our mobile product launch, working capital effects and consumer devices. And I don\u2019t expect that we can achieve the same level of working capital improvement for cable in 2018.","Within those constraints, however we remain opportunistic to preserve flexible create shareholder value.","Turning to taxes on slide 13, we don\u2019t currently expect to be a material cash income payer until 2021 at the earliest. Given the tax reform passed by Congress and signed into legislation last year, we estimate that the total present value for tax assets reflecting a later annual utilization against the lower rate has declined from just over $5 billion to about $3.5 billion. That decline is offset by the much larger value associated with net present value of tax reform, strides higher free cash flow and productivity.","Before moving to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate the financial framework for the launch of Spectrum mobile service later this year. We believe that our entry into mobility can further accelerate customer growth and drive for penetration.","The more customer growth we generate, the more incremental revenue we\u2019ll generation mobile and through cable. Much of that revenue in the beginning will be device contract revenue, which is fully recognized on the contract date and similarly as costs of goods sold under EIP accounting, with the actual customer payments received over a longer period.","As within e-subscription business there are upfront launch costs and the acquisition activity, which creates OpEx and CapEx, which exceed the gross margin benefits in the short-term. The more mobile customer growth we generate early on, the more EBITDA and initial cash flow drag we will experience in the early days.","And over time, we expect our mobile service to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a standalone basis, with broader growth benefits to our core cable services. Our mobile business will eventually be fully integrated as just another cable product in the bundle from a marketing care, billing and service perspective, so no different than internet or voice today and it will not be a separate P&L or segment as such.","To the launch phase we will be able to create transparency around cable performance by disclosing mobile revenue, mobile operating costs and therefore mobile effects on adjusted EBITDA.","We should also be able to isolate the launch\u2019s working capital impact from the timing of cash flow from device costs and related to subscriber payments. We will provide additional details on the mobile business we move through the year and as the business scales.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks, good morning. Chris, I have two questions for you, one around the customer trends and one around ARPU. So on the customer side you talked about elevated churn or I guess churn up year-on-year, due to disruption on all-digital, but also and maybe there related higher non-pay. So taking those two drivers and you look out into the rest of the year, do you expect net adds to be up year-on-year in the back half as presumably both of those headwinds particularly the non-pay piece fade obviously people are focused on subscriber trends. So any color there would be helpful?","And then on ARPU, could you just help us as we think about the rest of the year whether you expect ARPU growth to be higher or lower than what we saw in Q1 directionally based on at least the timing of the rate adjustments you have implemented?","Christopher Winfrey","Sure, on customer trends look if we\u2019ve talked -- the big driver was the non-pay disconnect had it not been for that customer net adds particularly in TWC for video and internet would have been better on a year-over-year basis. And so it\u2019s entirely driven by that actually. Sales are up across the company and across TWC in particular, which is obviously the largest driver. And so non-pay disconnect was the biggest factor.","The second piece that I would highlight is that where we\u2019ve increased to DOCSIS 3.1 not only were sales up year-over-year, but net adds were up significantly year-over-year in those markets. And the issues that Tom highlighted had been addressed for non-pay takes a little while to get up to systems by the end of Q2 OR early Q3. The disconnect side is expected to improve and it is improving throughout the first quarter and we\u2019d expect the same to continue through Q2.","So I guess we expect the net adds to improve, sales are looking very well. And so our expectation has been and remains that customer net adds will continue to improve.","On ARPU, the residential customer ARPU, which is I think is what you\u2019re referring to is the long relevant net tracker still a large amount of revenue reallocation from bundled pricing that goes on through Spectrum pricing and packaging. So I think the product ARPUs are somewhat irrelevant, but the customer relationship ARPU is.","The factors that I went through in the prepared remarks are we had a lower rate as you get more mature into the Spectrum pricing and packaging migration process you have a lower rate of SPP migration, which ruin some of the negative ARPU factor that we had over the past few quarters meaning it\u2019s just a lesser impact and you have more services, better sales. And so all of that\u2019s flowing through and then we did have some minor rate adjustments, which will carry through for the rest of the year. ","So without sitting back and giving guidance specifically by quarter, I think the ARPU headwinds that we had through the initial SPP migration should be less going forward. The one big factor I mentioned is that single-play internet selling is the other one the non-single play internet selling clearly has an impact to the overall customer relationship ARPU. And if we can get more in-depth for customers around willing to take video we will, and so I put that one caveat into the ARPU. ","Ben Swinburne","Okay that\u2019s good color. Thank you. ","Stefan Anninger ","Mitchell we\u2019ll take our next question please. ","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is open. ","Jonathan Chaplin","Thanks. Chris hoping to get a little bit more color on the trajectory of wireless losses that you are expecting post the JV that you guys have announced with Comcast. So we have been expecting similar losses to Comcast delayed by ER. And I am wondering if that\u2019s sort of a reasonable place to set our expectations? And then how would the JV and the sharing of costs change that?","Christopher Winfrey","Sure, and look it\u2019s a brand new business and we have our budget, we know what we plan to do, I think using Comcast as a proxy is as good as any at this point. But the biggest driver there is about subscriber acquisition there is a lot of upfront subscriber acquisition costs. These are NPV positive customer acquisitions once you get to a study your state growth business has not only a positive EBITDA, but a positive free cash flow contribution on a standalone basis.","So the faster we grow the more short-term pressure we put on to EBITDA and free cash flow. Now having said that and Comcast has been extremely helpful to Charter as we go through establishing back office systems and that JV should continue to help us do that. So is there an opportunity that the go-forward platform cost for companies are reduced by sharing in those expenses and that\u2019s the whole idea of getting into the JV.","So I think on a relative basis because it\u2019s how we\u2019re cooperating now could we do marginally better, maybe, but I would say that both companies should benefit from the JV that we signed together.","Thomas Rutledge","Yes, this is Tom, Jonathan so I agree with Chris that both companies should benefit by the joint venture from an operating costs perspective and therefore the business is more valuable as a result of that. How we -- we will not have the same marketing strategies and so we will diverge in terms of performance most likely. And so really the impact is driven by the speed at which we roll the business out. And how successful we are in the market.","Jonathan Chaplin","Great, thank you.","Thomas Rutledge","Thanks, Jonathan.","Stefan Anninger ","Michelle, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi there, this is actually Kathy Owen [ph] for Craig Moffet. My question is just looking at the stock reaction today it seems specific that investor are calling into question the Charter story, can you provide your own perspective on whether you think the long-term story has changed, do you think video subscribership can still grow? Have your expectations about broadband growth changed?","And then most importantly of all can you talk about the free cash flow generation capability of the business? Has there changed longer term and does wireless change that? Thank you.","Thomas Rutledge","Well, Kathy no, simply our vision of the business is what we expected several years ago and continue to expect going forward. We think that there is superior infrastructure that allows us to standout having now more competitive products than alternative networks. And we\u2019ve been successfully selling and market our product, but at the same time going through a very complex integration of three very large companies to get to a single simple platform.","That integration is actually going quite well and pretty much as planned. It has lumpy aspects to it as we combine the companies in various ways, but generally we are going exactly as we planned and creating the kind of future value that we expect to create.","And since we told our initial story obviously we\u2019ve done the acquisitions and we\u2019ve done an entry into mobility, which we think is a natural fit to our existing infrastructure and service infrastructure. And will create additional value for the shareholders that wouldn\u2019t be created without doing it. So we think the Charter story is fully intact and getting better as a result of the mobility. ","In terms of the capital intensity and free cash flow creation, I think there are -- obviously we\u2019re in a capital intensive trend at the moment as we integrate and as we make our networks all-digital so that we can take advantage of all capabilities of network, which was planned and -- but the long run trend is less capital intensity.","And significantly less capital intensity as our need to buy CPD goes away and as CPD cost come down and there are some forces there that are even greater than we had thought, I mean, obviously the change in video, the change in the video marketplace essentially requires less capital intensity in video. Because with the competitors that we faced and with our own process and IT you don\u2019t necessarily need new set top boxes, you can move to an application based delivery system in some situations.","So within that along with declining prices for CPD mean capital intensity improves maybe marginally better than we might have thought previously. The changes in the video business they are significant and hard to predict, but we still think there\u2019s video growth capable inside of our asset base, it\u2019s fairly marginally insignificant though and since in this sense there is very little margin in the video business. So whether you are right to optimize a 1 million customers is relatively immaterial to our plan.","And while we think that we will make a great video product available to our customers and that that great video product will continue to help us drive the overall connectivity business we have. If we are passed in our forecast of that it\u2019s not significantly financially material to our growth prospects.","So I can\u2019t explain the market reactions, but our activity and our project management is going as we expected and the kind of marketplace acceptance of our products is going as we expected.","Unidentified Speaker","Okay, got it. So\u2026","Christopher Winfrey","Cathy maybe I would just add few quick thoughts to that one is if you think around the timing of good quarter, off quarter as it relates to net adds for somebody\u2019s model. Lot of people are looking for a linear outcome and we\u2019ve tried to do as best as we can and it\u2019s not going be linear and if you take a look back at the Legacy Charter experience, if you look at on an annual basis, it looks pretty linear. But if you go back and take a look at 2013 and 2014 in particular it really was anything but linear. That applies to net adds and it applies to the financial results.","And it looks choppy, as we were going through so in some respects market reaction, which I haven\u2019t focused on that much as of yet this morning, it\u2019s a little bit of deja vu. And we are turning a lot of miles same as we did with Legacy Charter and the integration, there is a lot of moving parts, but the trajectory we think remains as good as ever.","The second one is on the impact of wireless where the conversations we\u2019ve had with some investors, is somewhere bifurcated, on one hand there is a group of investors who get it and say go as fast as you can from a competitive standpoint, it\u2019s the right thing to do, it does have the positive NPV and it\u2019s an attractive business.","And then there is another group who are very, very focused on the short-term impact to EBITDA and free cash flow and what that might to do to an overall growth rate. So one, we are going to isolate that impact so people can focus on the core value creation of the cable platform and the optioned value, if you want to call it that on the mobility business.","But that investment relative to the overall size of Charter\u2019s revenue or EBITDA relatively small and the potential upside impact to that investment is significant. And I think that\u2019s the piece that is missing in terms of understanding and putting that upfront investment into perspective.","So we are going to isolate it along the way so people if they see it as a bet they can size up, size that bet and understand the relative materiality. But we think it\u2019s attractive, I think it\u2019s going to help us not only add EBITDA and free cash flow over time, but we think it\u2019s very constructive and helpful towards further internet growth in particular in the cable business.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. So from a free cash flow perspective your longer term the interest hasn\u2019t changed even if the mix shift to get there may have moved around a little bit with the video environment getting worst?","Christopher Winfrey","No, I mean, the biggest free cash flow generation that you are going see from 2019 CapEx when it comes down and that hasn\u2019t changed. This year, we are doing all-digital, we are doing the DOCSIS 3.1, we still have a tremendous amount of integration capital that\u2019s inside these numbers and that essentially comes out next year.","And in the meantime despite some lumpiness on subscriber net adds from one quarter to the next, the financial results we mentioned Q4 would be the low point on EBITDA during the whole identification the business is moving, it does mean that it\u2019s going be linear, so never treat it that way. But we did have the low point already on the financials and the business is moving in the right direction.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Cathy. Mitchell we will take our next question please.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Just following up on the prior question. When you were going to this transition on legacy Charter and there was disruption on cash flow and obviously with all the inflection in cash flow on the Time Warner Cable transaction. But you also had pretty robust subscriber growth and you were getting the share. Obviously I think now the question is, if the market environment changed enough that would you have to revisit your strategy, given I think you have a lot of levers to pull on pricing and tearing and the like.","So I was just trying to see given the market environment we might get to the same free cash flow numbers at the end, and really sort of if you could talk about is there some tweaking on strategy that needs to be done to do that given the market environment? Thanks.","Thomas Rutledge","Vijay, its Tom. Obviously the markets move through time, our strategy moves with it and we think that that we have needed to change our product and our mix in order to take advantage of our assets and beat the marketplace effectively. And we think that we can do that and are doing that and our sales volume and our connect volume and our management of our customer base, pricing and packaging give us confidence that we can continue to do that.","Take data speeds for instance with Legacy Charter, like Charter and our average data speed was 10 megabits and we took the minimum up overtime to 30 and created most of our subscriber growth at 30. Today in this new model where we\u2019ve just gone to 200 meg minimum speed in the significant part of our market 100 megabit speed. And even bigger part of our market, but that\u2019s shifting as we rolled out this 3.1 technology.","So we\u2019ve taken the advantage of the marketplace and the capacity of our network to change our data product so that it will continue to drive the kind of results we expected to get. But we are in the middle of the tooling of that process right now as we integrate the company. We have a vastly superior product almost everywhere we operate. And we expect to get results from that. ","And if we need to change that two years from now we have the ability to do it at very little or very small incremental costs, which is the beauty of the infrastructure that we built out in this company.","So, I guess the answer to your question is we have the same high expectations for free cash flow growth in this entity now based in the current marketplace as we understand it now just like we did five or six years ago.","Vijay Jayant","Great, thanks so much. ","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Vijay. Michelle we\u2019ll take our next question, please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks. I have two, I think just staying on subscriber trends and the stock price, I feel like it sounds like maybe 2019 is when we finally get to stabilization in sub-trends and maybe that\u2019s when the market will start to give you a little bit more credit maybe as we get closer. So is that a fair statement or thought?","And then secondly unrelated, as we dig into 5G, I think it\u2019s becoming more apparent that cellular backhaul is increasingly important. And I guess how do you think this plays out overtime and how can you better monetize this especially with a larger platform?","Christopher Winfrey","So Marci, I don\u2019t know when markets award you or don\u2019t award you. Ultimately our job is to create the free cash flow that we expect from these assets and we think we are on track do that. We\u2019re on track with the plans that we made. So whether we\u2019ll get rewarded before that occurs or after it occurs I don\u2019t know, but we expect to create the free cash flow.","And in terms of the infrastructure that we had, we do think that we are the natural small cell provider and that we have the most efficient ability to provide small cell connectivity compared to any other small cell competitor we have. And we have 26 million small cell who are already connected to our network and we have 250 million wireless devices already connected to those small cell and we plan to continue to build out the small cell environment.","How that relates to other business opportunities it\u2019s hard to say, but we have them.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you. ","Stefan Anninger ","Michelle, we will take our next question, please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Bazinet ","Thanks. This is for Mr. Rutledge, I guess, I know the strategy is to get more people attached to your fixed cost network, but I had a question when I was going through the case if your competitors and yours and just doing benchmarking. Whether I look at the customer relationships per employee or revenue per employee, Charter doesn\u2019t fair that favorably you are sort of 10%, 20%, 30% below all your publicly listed peers.","And so my question is, if the unit growth sort of evaporates from the ecosystem or if you are unsuccessful sort of getting the attached rate up, do you think there is a potential cost element? Said another way is there something materially structural about your footprint or your systems that would make you less productive if you will vis-\u00e0-vis your peer cable companies? Thank you.","Thomas Rutledge","Yes, that\u2019s very interesting question. The short answer is, no. In fact we think we will be more productive. But we are in the middle of a transition where we are moving from an outsource environment to an in-source environment. And we create a more professional workforce that is designed to provide higher quality service, which will improve subscriber lines and reduce transaction volume ultimately in our business. So it will have less transactions per customer.","If we have less transactions per customer, we believe and with which we are trending forward everyday as our operations improve and as the skillets that we are need are developed inside the company. So if you think about what I just said in-sourcing and outsourcing at the moment, we decided to move costs from the Philippines to St. Louis for instance.","We have to stand up a brand new call center in St. Louis, we have to build it out physically so there is capital involved, and then we have the higher workforce and train workforce to take the costs. ","In the meantime we are still outsourcing to the Philippines so that workforce is up and running and skilled. Once the workforce is skilled though then the number of transactions that occur as a result of having a higher skilled force goes down.","And we think that the transaction volume goes down faster than the costs structure goes up by having it in-sourced call center. And that when you have less transactions per customer you actually have happier customers. And so there not only are they less costly to serve they are happier and if they are -- and because they are happier their average life extends, which means that the average value per sale that you create goes up.","And the number of transactions connect and disconnect per dollar of revenue that you spend goes down. So we\u2019re still in the middle of a transition process that has operating expense in it that\u2019s part of the strategy.","But our expectation down the road, which is part of the free cash flow drive of the business is that you get this virtuous growth structure where you get better served customers who have -- who cost you less and are happier. And that benefit yet to be realized from our activity today, but it is part of our plan and our expectation. And the numbers that we expect to generate today that will prove out that thesis are occurring as we expected.","Christopher Winfrey","Just add to the way you can tie it to the P&L the metric, I think, the metric you are using is actually not right because it\u2019s apples and oranges. So if you think about the Time Warner Cable call enter infrastructure at one point, you could have had 50% over 50% was outsourced. Today over 85% of that is in-source. If you are taking a look at employees you are completely ignoring the amount of contract labor that\u2019s inside there. And so it\u2019s an apples and oranges comparison between the two there like the operating models.","If you look at cost to service customers they are -- we have all of the investment that Tom just spoke about, but despite having all of that investment and despite having customer relationship growth of over 3%, our cost to service customers gross is actually coming down, excluding this bad debt temporary effect.","So our cost to service customers, which is where the vast majority where the labor cost exist is already coming down on a gross basis and on a net basis leading on a per customer basis is actually already coming down dramatically despite the amount of upfront investments that we are making that Tom highlighted.","So I think you have to normalize for what\u2019s -- you can\u2019t just look at house labor you have to add in the contract labor, which has come down dramatically and for some companies comprises a very, very significant portion of the overall labor costs.","Jason Bazinet ","Understood, thank you. ","Christopher Winfrey","Thanks, Jason. ","Stefan Anninger ","Michelle, next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Great, couple of questions. I guess first for Chris, from your comments on the non-pay disconnected it sounds like you\u2019re already starting to see some acceleration in PSU trends. If you just confirm that or whether we have to sort of wait another quarter before we see that inflection as that issue sort of lapses?","And then two maybe for Tom, it sounds like you guys are seeing some improving underlying fundamentals in the HSD side, when you go to 200 megabits in a market. And I think you said you are 25% now, and I may have missed it, but when do you get to 100%? And maybe if you could give us some more detail on what you see when you get to 200 megabits as a base and whether or not you feel you have additional pricing power in those markets given the competitive landscape there? Thanks.","Christopher Winfrey","So on the improvement, yes we had less of a negative impact from the non-pay disconnect issue, which is since then address throughout the quarter. The last of the systemic changes we needed to make for that take to place occurred inside of April. And so we expect it to continue to ameliorate during the course of Q2. And it should be fully out by the beginning of Q3.","So the trends are improving in that particular area and I don\u2019t want to get run into guidance, but we wouldn\u2019t have said what we said if we didn\u2019t fell that particular issue was declining in its materiality. ","John Hodulik","Great. ","Thomas Rutledge","So John, I think we said that there we\u2019ve got a 200 megabits in front of 25% of our customer base. We have built out at this moment 43% of our footprint to 1 gig speed capability using 3.1 DOCSIS capability. And by the end of the year we\u2019ll have 100% of our infrastructure capable of 1 gig or 200 megabits or 400 megabits. While we haven\u2019t said where we\u2019ll rollout 200 megabits, but it\u2019s in a substantial amount of markets today and we\u2019re getting good results from it.","We are also getting good results from our higher ultra-tier, which is 100 megabits, and it\u2019s selling in at a substantially higher rate than our previous set. So well I don\u2019t want to give you a forecast of where we got from a infrastructure perspective the entire network will be capable of this product mix this year.","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks. ","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, John. Michelle, next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar, Barclays Capital. Your line is open. ","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. I have a couple, Tom firstly, when you look at all the changes in the ecosystem right now, your peers are responding differently, slightly differently compared to where when you think about the price increases other cable companies have been a lot more aggressive. And strategically there\u2019s been a lot more pivot with AT&T Bank, Time Warner and Comcast Bank Sky. So when you think about the ecosystem as it is setup today, do you think you need to do something different compared to what you are doing right now longer term?","And then, Chris from your perspective when you look at normalized CapEx in the proxy, I think in the proxy it was about 12% of revenues in 2019. And like you mentioned earlier on the call you expect CapEx to drop next year, but right now it\u2019s at 19%. So when we go into 2019 without getting into specific numbers could you give us some sense of scale in terms of what CapEx could be like? Thanks.","Thomas Rutledge","So, this is Tom, as far as the ecosystem goes, I think we\u2019re strategically complete in a sense that we think that we can execute our business plan with the assets that we have. So I don\u2019t think we need to own content to do better that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t opportunities that might arise that are pricing property that would be synergistic with us.","But I think we are fairly confident that we can execute our strategy, which from our perspective we are a connectivity company selling connectivity relationship. Video is not material from a margin or EBITDA driver perspective, but it is at a standalone product, but it is material in terms of product attribute to the overall relationship that we create with customers.","And so, with a lot of access to video we have launched Netflix on our network, we plan to integrate all the video products into UI and make us the best place to get video of every kind. But that doesn\u2019t require us to own video assets per say.","Christopher Winfrey","On the capital expenditure, there was a proxy that was over three years ago used with our Board that ended up being publicly disclosed. So I don\u2019t want to go back in time and start looking at that other than to say we expect 2019 capital expenditure to be a materially lower amounts of gross dollars of CapEx. And in a growing new business, therefore materially smaller amounts as a percentage of revenue.","We will still have integration activity going on inside of 2019. And so that means that we expected as a percentage of revenue -- we expect to have continued solid revenue growth for many, many years to come, seems like your capital intensity just continues to decline. I think 2019 will be a big move and I think it continues to get better as a percentage of revenue from there.","I am speaking about cable capital expenditures, as a percentage of cable revenue, I don\u2019t think wireless is that or mobility is that big given all the factors that I described before where it moves through the P&L. But I think 2019 starts to fully expose the free cash flow capabilities of the company.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Alright, thank you","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Kannan. Mitchell, we will take our last question please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking my questions. And just two really clarification for Chris, you referenced your prior commentary around first quarter being a low point for EBITDA and I just want to clarify if that\u2019s all in EBITDA or EBITDA exclusive of anything you may spend on wireless?","And then just another follow-up, when you were discussing the buyback potential this year and how it will be mathematically lower, you cited stated the way you are going manage the leverage this year and it sounded like you maybe managing leverage a little lower. I don\u2019t know if I appreciate the nuance of what you are trying to communicate. So I was hoping we could just revisit that? Thank you.","Christopher Winfrey","Sure, so I am glad you asked the first question in case, I don\u2019t think I did that in case I misstated, what I said in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter of 2017 was the low point of EBITDA. I did not say that the first quarter was the low point of EBITDA, first quarter EBITDA was actually pretty good. And yes I think it will -- it continue to improve over time and that doesn\u2019t mean that that will be linear. So that certainly wasn\u2019t what I was implying. My comment from the fourth quarter 2017, which I reiterated today was that the fourth quarter of 2017 EBITDA was below for cable EBITDA growth.","In terms of managing leverage what we are trying to make sure that we do is that we stay within four and half times inclusive of the short-term launch cost for mobile and any working capital impacts from the launch of mobile. And what that means is that you need to create a little bit of headroom on your cable EBITDA leverage so that you can accommodate that upfront costs.","So the faster we go with wireless means that you might just need to pull in a little bit on your cable EBITDA leverage. And that\u2019s the only distinction I am making to make sure that the consolidated leverage remains at or below 4.5 time. We\u2019re a large issuer of the debt capital markets as well we have investment grade we have made commitments to that market. And as well that intend to keep them and has to make sure that we stay in line from that perspective.","Brett Feldman","Alright, thank you. That\u2019s was very helpful. I appreciate it. ","Christopher Winfrey","Thanks.","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Brett. Mitchell, that concludes our call.","Thomas Rutledge","Thank you everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5042":["Charter Communications, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.","Stefan Anninger ","Good morning and welcome to Charter's third quarter 2018 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings including our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. ","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Rutledge ","Thanks, Stefan. At the end of the third quarter 67% of our acquired residential customers were in our new Spectrum pricing and packaging, up from 62% at the end of the second quarter. So we\u2019re delivering better products at better prices to more customers which will driver lower churn, faster customer growth and [Technical Difficulty] financial growth. ","Over the last year we\u2019ve grown our total Internet customer base by over 1.2 million customers or 5.3%. In video, net losses this quarter were lessened than the third quarter of \u201817. ","In the third quarter we grew cable revenue by 4% year-over-year and adjusted cable EBITDA grew by 5.5%. During the quarter we rolled out our Gigabit speed offering to over 7 million homes passed, using very capital efficient DOCSIS 3.1 technology. Earlier this month, we launched our Gigabit service to more than 12 million additional homes passed. So we now offer Spectrum Internet Gig to over 95% of our passings and we will be offering Giga service in nearly all of our 51 million homes passed by the end of this year, and over 80% of our residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provide 100 megabits or more of speed. ","Our faster speeds are having our intended impact of driving Internet customer growth. In early September we executed a full market launch of our Spectrum Mobile service with the goal of accelerating connectivity relationship growth, and we expect our mobile product to be profitable on a standalone basis once it reaches scale. We now offer mobile services to both new and existing Spectrum Internet customers on both Apple and Android devices. Spectrum Mobile is being marketed via TV, radio, direct mail and through other advertising and marketing platforms and our selling machine is scaling across key existing sales channels including our stores, inbound call centers and online. ","We offer our mobile services at prices that give new and existing customers the opportunity to save hundreds of dollars per year on their mobile bills. Our unlimited service costs $45 a month and our By the Gig service is $14 per gigabyte. ","So far our broader market launch has gone very smoothly. Our mobile operations and the service itself are scaling and working well. We started selling the product after Labor Day, so our total customer base is relatively small at quarter end about 21,000 lines. But we\u2019re seeing steady new sales growth and yield in traditional cable sales as we build brand and product awareness. ","In the new next few months, we will enable customers to transfer their existing handsets. We also have a pipeline of product improvements that will extend through the middle of next year and which will continue to make our product more attractive and easier to switch and entire household\u2019s mobile service package. Ultimately the goal is to use Spectrum Mobile to save customers\u2019 money via an integrated superior product offering, driving faster customer growth and better retention, higher penetration and greater [indiscernible] capacity. ","Shifting back to cable, our all-digital initiative is on schedule for completion by year end. About 95% of our footprint is now all-digital. By the end of this year the whole company will be fully digitized as we deploy fully functioning two-way digital set-top box, mostly our WorldBox and increasingly third-party IP devices on all remaining analog TV outlets that we serve.","Simultaneous implementation of high touch integration projects and product improvements, which are nearly finished, is actually counter to our operating strategy of reducing service interactions. The customer disruption that all-digital drives is well understood but the migration of millions of customers to Spectrum pricing and packaging, the different equipment and bills, installation of uniform business practices, the integration of various product, network IP and billing platforms, and parallel network upgrades and integration has also been disruptive to our sales, service, customer transactions and churn. We said at the start of this integration that putting Charter in a position to operate as a single entity and grow faster over the long-term would impact our operating and financial outputs during the integration and drive outsized capital investment in the short-term. But our integration is coming to a close and most of the disruption will be behind us in 2019, and we will quickly start to see the tangible benefits of our operating strategy to lower churn, continued higher sales and increasing operational efficiency, resulting in higher revenue per passing and lower operating costs. ","The completion of our integration will also bring a meaningful reduction in capital spending. And as one company with a superior bandwidth rich network, a unified product marketing and service infrastructure, and value creation model as laid out on slide 4 of today's presentation, we believe we know what works. We will be in a position to accelerate growth, and innovate faster than where we have been over the last few years. ","Now, I will turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Winfrey ","Thanks, Tom. A few administrative items before covering the results. So I mentioned on our last call we\u2019re now reporting all of the results on a consolidated basis. There was a small impact to our Q3 results due to Hurricane Florence primarily in the Carolinas. The impact to the customer base was a few thousand customers and the financial impact was about $5 million to each, revenue and operating expense. So a little over $10 million in adjusted EBITDA. We had a similar impact from storms during the third quarter of last year, so the year-over-year impact is not material.","We\u2019re still in clean-up mode for Hurricane Florence and we are in restoration mode for Hurricane Michael. We will provide a similar update on our Q4 call as needed although we don\u2019t expect material year-over-year impact from either hurricanes.","Finally as a reminder starting on January 1st of this year, we prospectively adopted FASB\u2019s new revenue recognition standard. Like last quarter, there are a number of adjustments in the quarter related to the adoption of the standard, both in revenue and expenses, which in total lowered EBITDA by about $15 million this quarter as compared to last year. That year-over-year impact from the accounting change will go way after Q4. ","Now, turning to our results. Total residential and SMB customer relationships grew by 234,000 in the third quarter to 903,000 over the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, Internet grew by 380,000 in the quarter. Video declined by 54,000 and Voice declined by 77,000. As Tom mentioned, 67% of our acquired residential customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the third quarter.","We expect to be above 70% by the end of this year and similar to what we saw at Legacy Charter Pricing and packaging migration transactions are slowing, which together with the completion of network upgrades this year means that in 2019 we will see lower CPE spending and meaningful churn [indiscernible].","In residential Internet we added a total of 266,000 customers versus 250,000 last year. Total Internet company sales were higher year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, we now offer Gigabit service in over 95% of our footprint, and expect to have that service available nearly everywhere by the end of 2018. ","Over the last 12 months we have grown our total residential Internet customer base by 1.1 million customers or 4.9%. Over last year, our residential video customers have declined by about 1.6%, all of which have come from limited basic. Sales of our Stream and Choice vid packages which are primarily targeted at Internet only continued to do well. ","In Voice, we lost 107,000 residential voice customers versus a gain of 26,000 last year driven by a lower triple play selling mix and lower retention at TWC. In September we made a change in the way we market and price wireline voice within our packages to address wireline voice selling, retention and rolloff and the launch of mobile. In most of our markets our Internet and Video double play pricing will be $90 [indiscernible] targeted acquisition pricing elsewhere. In either case, wireline voice at acquisition is now a $10 add-on with no change to that pricing if a customer rolls off a bundled promotion. ","With wireline voice, as the $10 value-added service going forward, mobile is now positioned to be the triple play value driver for connectivity sales, similar to what wireline voice did for cable over the last decade. And even though the revenue per household for the new triple play will be higher, we will be saving customers more money with the best products. ","Turning to mobile then, as Tom mentioned, we executed the broader market launch for Spectrum Mobile product on September 4. So our third quarter results include only short period of active marketing and sales of the product. As of the end of the quarter we had about 21,000 mobile lines with a mix of unlimited and By the Gig lines. ","We\u2019re still focused on branding and awareness marketing that some of you may have seen. As we add new features and functionality, putting greater device capabilities, the marketing will become more offer-driven. Essentially all of our existing sales channels will be activated and integrated for mobile over the coming quarters. All of which will help drive continued acceleration of mobile line adds and overall connectivity relationships. ","Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 734,000 or 2.9%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 0.4% year-over-year, given a lower rate of SPP migration, promotional campaign roll-off and rate adjustments, which was significantly offset by last year's third quarter Mayweather and McGregor fight, short over $50 million in revenue last year, a higher mix of Internet only customers and higher full year sales of promotional rates. Excluding pay-per-view and VOD residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.1% year-over-year. ","Slide 7 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 3.3%. Excluding the impact of pay-per-view and VoD and some readjustments last summer, that were not mirrored this quarter, residential revenue grew by 4.4% so similar to last quarter's growth rate. ","Turning to commercial, total SMB and enterprise combined grew by 4.3% in the third quarter, with SMB up 2.8% and enterprise up by 6.4%. Excluding cell backhaul and Navisite, enterprise grew by over 9% with PSU growth of 15%. Sales were up in SMB as well and we've grown SMB customer relationships by over 10% from the last year. Revenue growth in the acquired markets hasn\u2019t yet followed the unit growth. The revenue growth impacted repricing of our SMB products has slowed and our SMB revenue growth has essentially bottomed out over the last two quarters. In 2019, we expect less impact from the repricing on our SMB revenue growth. ","Third quarter advertising revenue grew by 18% year-over-year political advertising accounted for all that growth as it also utilized its traditional inventory. We also continue to sell more overall spots with better inventory utilization and targeted selling. ","Mobile revenue totaled $17 million with essentially all of Q3 revenue in voice revenue. As a reminder, under our equipment installment plans or EIP, all future device installment payments are recognized as revenue on the connect day. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year with cable revenue growth of 4.0% or 4.1% when excluding both advertising and pay-per-view and VOD. ","Moving to operating expense on Slide 8, in the third quarter, total operating expenses grew by $302 million or 4.6% year-over-year. Excluding mobile operating expenses increased 3.1%. Programming increased 3% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases and renewals, offset by a lower base of total video customers and last year's Mayweather and McGregor fight which also reduced our year-over-year programming cost by 1.6%. So excluding pay-per-view and VOD programming cost, in this and last year's third quarter, programming grew by 4.4% with 5.8% on a per video customer basis. ","Regulatory connectivity and produce content grew by 4.4% primarily driven by our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1st which we reclassed some expenses to this line in this quarter. Cost to the service customers grew by 1.7% year-over-year compared to 3.4% customer relationship growth. We are lowering our per relationship service cost through changes in business practices and continue to see early productivity benefits from ongoing investments. ","Cable marketing expense grew by 3.7% year-over-year driven by higher sales. The cable expenses were up 5.5% year-over-year driven by ad sales cost, enterprise cost and IT cost from ongoing integration. Mobile expense totaled $94 million and was comprised of device cost, market launch cost and operating expenses to stand up and operate the business including our own personnel and overhead cost and our portion of the JV with Comcast, we accounted for which we discussed on last quarter's call.","Device cost by device revenue, are immediately recognized but consumer payments for handsets are generally received over a two year period. Hence, the working capital headwind is highlighted. Adjusted cable EBITDA grew by 5.5% in the third quarter and when including the impact of mobile total adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.5%. ","Turning to net income on Slide 9, we generated $493 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $48 million last year and that was driven by a pension re-measurement gain this quarter, lower depreciation and amortization expense, higher adjusted EBITDA and lower severance-related expenses, partly offset by higher interest expense.","Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the third quarter, $275 million lower than last year. The decline was primarily driven by lower CPE and scalable infrastructure spend, partly offset by spend on mobile. CPE was down given a year-over-year decline in the volume and migration of the acquired customers to our Spectrum pricing and packaging. We spent about $42 million in all-digital this quarter versus $47 million in the third quarter of last year and $88 million in the second quarter of this year. The decline in scalable infrastructure capital is related to more consistent timing of in-year spend this year versus last.","Line extension spending was up year-over-year as we continue to build out and fulfill our merger conditions. We spent $66 million on mobile related CapEx this quarter driven by software, some of which is related to our JV Comcast and on renovation to create mobile product marketing areas in our stores. As I mentioned last quarter our CapEx spending is more level loaded this year than last.","For the full year we continue to expect the cable capital expenditures as a percentage of cable revenue to be similar or slightly lower than 2017. We also expect 2019 cable CapEx to be down meaningfully in absolute dollar terms and in terms of capital intensity.","The Slide 11 shows we generated $532 million of consolidated free cash flow in this quarter including $149 million of investment in mobile. Excluding mobile we generated $681 million of cable free cash flow compared to $594 million last year. The increase was largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cable CapEx year-over-year and lower severance expense. Now it\u2019s partly offset by higher cash paid for interest and a negative contribution of cash flow from working capital. A negative change in working capital is primarily the result of lower CapEx payables on our already declining year-over-year capital intensity. ","I also expect our working capital related reduction to cash flow in the fourth quarter at least as compared to last year. If you recall that last year's fourth quarter working capital benefited from a much higher level of capital expenditures and from the end quarter timing of that capital expenditure both driving temporary outsized payables. Q4 of this year will not have that level of benefit due to the more level loaded CapEx spend this year.","And in the fourth quarter we will see the initial working capital investment in mobile device EIP sales where the associated revenue is recovered over a two year period. We will continue to isolate that impact within the overall mobile reporting as that trend accelerates in tandem with wireless subscriber growth.","Looking to next year we do expect a working capital related reduction to our cash flow in the first quarter of 2019 for cable and that\u2019s due to lower CapEx and it shouldn\u2019t be quite as pronounced as what we saw in the first quarter of this year. We finished the quarter with $71.5 billion in debt principal, our current run rate annualized cash interest expense is $3.9 billion -- I am sorry annual cash interest payments annualized was $3.9 billion whereas our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggests a $3.6 billion annual run rate. That difference is primarily due to purchase accounting. And as of the end of the third quarter our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47 times at the high end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times.","And at the end of quarter we held over $4 billion in liquidity and cash on hand and revolver capacity. And during the third quarter we repaid $2 billion of debt maturity and we also raised $2 billion in the investment grade market. Also during the third quarter we repurchased 3.5 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $1.1 billion at an average price of $303 per share. Since September of 2016 we\u2019ve repurchased about 18% of Charter's equity. And we intend to stay at or below 4.5 times leverage on a consolidated basis, including the impact of mobile on our financials. ","So looking ahead, the level of integration activity, capital expenditure and service impact and changes including network upgrades will continue through the end of fourth quarter. So we\u2019re looking forward to 2019 as the largest ever cable integration will be mostly behind us. Based on that -- but based on both past experience and the operating metrics we already see, we expect continued strong demand for improving connectivity products set, which includes faster Internet speeds and great mobile product that saves consumers\u2019 significant money and high quality, attractively priced bundled services by video and wireline voice. And that growth combined with lower integration activity beginning in 2019 and declining capital intensity will demonstrate long-term benefits for our customer-focused operating strategy and our cable free cash flow potential. ","Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open. ","Vijay Jayant ","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to unpack the video trend, obviously the losses decline in the quarter, I think you called out Stream and Choice packages become a bigger piece and that limited basic is moderating. Can you just help us understand sort of what's really going on, on the video competitive landscape and the growth on the expanded basic product? And then for Chris, I just wanted to reconfirm your comments, which was that there was 15 million hit from accounting changes and about 10 million from the hurricane. So, the EBITDA impact was about 25 million? Thank you. ","Thomas Rutledge ","So Vijay, on the macro issues, I guess there are two things to explain. One is that our desire to sell feature-rich high-value video products as part of our overall market-facing strategy, meaning when we sell or create a customer, we like to -- we believe it's appropriate to try to give that customer the full capabilities of our service. And then through time, as a result of that, keep that customer and satisfy that customer fully. In order to implement that strategy, we sell full packages of product in video which means we don't sell video or basic-only products generally incrementally. And therefore, as we grow, we're growing rich products and shrinking our broadcast-only base. And so that, that was a strategy at Legacy Charter, Legacy Cablevision actually. And so we\u2019ve been implementing that through this transaction successfully. So if you're actually a programmer receiving funds from us, we're growing in your eyes, because we\u2019re growing expanded basic as part of every acquisition we make generally. Every new customer to get. So that\u2019s our product strategy. In terms of where the overall marketplace is, I think it continues to be pressured for all the reasons we expressed before by high cost of content, the fact that the content is bundled the way it is as is wholesale to us and the fact that it's not very secure incrementally on the IP level meaning that you can get it without paying for it, all this puts pressure on price along with the whole value proposition of the content because it\u2019s continually going up in cost. And I don\u2019t see those trends changing. And so you see a continued erosion of the overall marketplace for bundled video. That doesn\u2019t mean we can't be successful in that marketplace using video to drive our overall customer relationship growth. And that our video products can be relatively better than other companies\u2019 video products and that we can achieve share shifts as a result of that. ","Christopher Winfrey ","Vijay, on the accounting question. So we've had due the adoption of the rev rec standards since the beginning of the year. We had some small impact in Q1 and Q2. It's a little larger in Q3, so we just made a mention of it. But you are right it is $15 million on a year-over-year basis meaning that there is a $15 million hit to EBITDA this quarter as compared to last year. As we get into Q1 of next year that year-over-year comparison difference will go away. And the other item that you mentioned is that over $10 million related to the storms. That is true that it lowered our EBITDA this quarter but it's also true that in the third quarter of last year we had a pretty similar amount that was flowing through. So just be careful when you are adjusting that on -- it's definitely relative for forward-looking, on a year-over-year comparison, it's about the same. Does that make sense? ","Vijay Jayant ","Right. Thanks so much. ","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Vijay. Michelle, we will take our next question please. ","Operator","The next question is from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Two things around pricing and revenue. First, can you compare the price increases that we've seen in the last week to last years and any impact higher or lower on broadband or video revenue this year? And then second, can you help us sort of think about your expectations for revenue and EBITDA on the next few years. I know you are not going to give guidance, but you've talked about an acceleration, I think it would help to put some framework around it. We understand you don't expect revenue to grow 4% and EBITDA 5.5% from here. But what's the level of increase we could expect in the next few years as you come out of the transition? Thank you. ","Christopher Winfrey ","Hey, Phil. This is Chris. It sounds like you are looking for a lot of guidance. There were \u2013 our core pricing and packaging other than what I mentioned on our double play pricing and what we are doing with it [indiscernible]. Our core pricing and packaging hasn\u2019t changed. And you are right that we've a few small increases on different services around the edges but it's not really material. The full impact of which you won\u2019t see in our numbers until December. ","So I know that's starts to roll through some of the billing cycles in November but full impact really won't be there for a full month until December. And that's what we've done today. It doesn\u2019t mean that ultimately that's where we will be for the full year in 2019 but it is slightly lower amount and what has been gone through this year and the last year so I think I had mentioned in my comments, we took, so meaning in 2017 we had some smaller increases that went in January, we had some smaller increases that went in August, certainly that impacted the comp for this year Q3 on Q3. ","We have got some small around the edge rate increases, which you\u2019ve highlighted, I know you have written about it as well, but they won\u2019t be fully impacted until December and during the course of 2019 we will see where we are. But if you were to just take that and say how does that compare to what we did in the January this year, it would do slightly less than that. ","Revenue and EBITDA acceleration without giving guidance, the first one ties purely to customer relationship growth and from SMB having bottomed out. We think SMB is going to continue to improve. Will it be at the full rate of customer relationship growth next year? No, it won't because there\u2019s still repackaging and pricing that\u2019s going on. ","Enterprise is going through a similar phase, slightly behind SMB and certainly behind resi in terms of where it was just given the way that\u2019s contractual. So -- and then next year as well we are going to have the absence of political advertising which you have to keep in mind as well. What remains when you put all those pieces together is how fast can you grow your customer relationship growth and some very smaller rate increase that we just talked about. ","We think we can grow our customer relationships. We think the step ups will continue to play in as we have been in a high acquisition or with a lot of customers going into promotion which then roll off. But a lot of that political advertising, SMB and enterprise which I just covered and the remainder really ties to customer relationship growth and some promotional roll-offs.","From EBITDA, there's a lot of benefit that comes from taking transactions out of the system, not only in the cost of those transactions but also reducing churn which means that the same marketing and sales dollars can be applied to new sales as opposed to replacing the customers that you just lost. And that generates not only incremental revenue but higher EBITDA. Our cost of service today continues to go down on a per customer relationship basis. We think that continues to go down, maybe even accelerating in terms of how efficient we can become. And as much noise as we think we are taking out of the system as it relates to transactions in TWC both the number of calls and service calls and churn at TWC is still significantly higher than it is at Legacy Charter, which means there is a big opportunity that\u2019s still sits in front of us.","Stefan Anninger ","Michele we will take our next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","I wonder if you could just -- a little bit about the wireless business. Tom you have talked in the past about some limitations technologically with respect to the network controller and your ability to direct traffic between Verizon's network and your own network. How do you think about the MVNO in terms of sort of strategic sufficiency for your ambitions in wireless? And what might you need to do to ensure that MVNO sort of satisfies your needs?","Thomas Rutledge ","Good question, Craig, and I have read some of your materials recently on that as well. And I would say this: We are a wireless company today and have over 300 million authenticated devices on our network prior to the launch of our MVNO. And as we move through the MVNO it does have limitations on our ability to manage that networking and certainly has limitations on our ability to get owners economics in some ways, although we can shift traffic onto our own network through Wi-Fi and increasingly look more likely through new spectrum that will be available to us also in a public way, like Wi-Fi in the form of the CBRS, so we got five spectrum, some of which will be public and some of which will be sold at auction. There are our new technologies coming along with dual SIM and eSIMs in mobile devices, which will allow somebody with an MVNO like us to actually run their own network and an MVNO simultaneously on the same device, which is an interesting thought as you go forward in terms of what you can do and how you manage traffic and how you can do that efficiently so that the MVNO was good for us and fit the consumers\u2019 needs. But we could manage our own network and traffic on network in a more efficient way than we can today. ","But today we have a limited MVNO and it doesn't do what ultimately we would like it to do and -- but it\u2019s more than we have -- more than we had a couple months ago. So it enhances the total value of our product. We can still save our customers tremendous amounts of money on their wireless bill every month and give them more services than they are currently getting because we can package that with the products that we have. And back to what I started the conversation with Vijay was, our product bundle is superior in terms of its total capability to what others are providing in the marketplace. And so therefore, we simply can grow our business. And we look at our current mobile relationship, our MVNO as a way to do that. But that doesn't mean that there aren\u2019t opportunities going forward technologically that we will ultimately be able to take advantage of.","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Craig. Michelle we will take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. ","Benjamin Swinburne ","Going back to your prepared remarks where you talked about the integration having been disruptive to the business. And as you expect to quickly see benefits in customer growth and meaningful churn benefits, maybe you guys could just spend a minute talking about where that disruption showed up in the 2018 financials and customer metrics? And so it would help us think about the improvements you should see as we head into \u201819 and I don\u2019t know if it makes sense, but it also be worth hearing from you really when you think this company is operating sort of full steam ahead, for lack of a better phrase, without the complexity of this integration, is that literally January, is the phase-in over the course of the year. I just think helping without giving guidance we can hear your enthusiasm for the business coming around the turn of the calendar but putting a little more specifics about it would be helpful? ","Thomas Rutledge ","Sure, Ben. Look I think the biggest impact on the financials in 2018 of the integration was in capital spending. And that ties into disruption and the operations too, so let me explain. We\u2019ve spent a lot of money to upgrade the network to all-digital. When we purchased Time Warner cable and Bright House, which you\u2019ve got to remember too was 3 times the size, Charter is one-quarter size of the new company put together. And it had -- that new company in most of the acquisition footprint still had analog television on and analog television is very fat but doesn\u2019t require set-top box. And so it has two negative attributes to -- three negative attributes to our ultimate strategy. One, it eats up channel spectrum that we ultimately want to use for high-speed data and IP video. It is an inferior picture and without a -- and in order to fix it you have to put a set-top box on the customers\u2019 televisions, which in itself is very disruptive. So we decided that it was necessary to get the spectrum back for the long run benefit of the business, even though it meant that we were going to have to go out to millions of customers and put new set-top boxes on analog outlet so that we could recover the spectrum. That all-digital process is completely contrary to our operating strategy, which is to provide superior products packaged in an appropriate way that takes activity out of the business, so that the overall customer relationship is less transaction intensive and therefore longer life. And as a result of that virtue is from a consumer perspective meaning the consumer gets the price they want with less activity, they last longer, so there is more revenue per transaction and it's a much more satisfying form of business. Completely contrary to that is to go visit millions of customer houses and put the digital set-top boxes that the consumers don\u2019t necessarily want an outlet that they may not even know they have. ","So that was one -- that capital to buy the set-top boxes, to roll the trucks and the disruption in the operating business and the impact that has on phone traffic and service calls, and therefore the ability to focus on sales, all that impacted both 2017 and 2018. ","The other thing we did because of the changing marketplace, we thought it was necessary to take our speeds up. We have a superior infrastructure almost everywhere we operate, and we need to make that superior infrastructure available to our customers in terms of its capability. And so we did the 1 gig upgrade across the entire footprint in a very short period of time. That was also a very capital intensive. And as a result of that, also required a lot of activity in head-ins and hubs where we had to sort of replumb the architecture and reallocate the spectrum that we received back from all-digital project to our high speed data product. ","And if you think about the way Time Warner operated as independent divisions for years and years and Bright House, these were separately built companies that had separate architectures, in many cases 50 divisions at one point. And so all of that had to be re-architected electronically into a uniform environment. We did the same thing with our call centers, sales centers, stores. We had multiple systems, building systems throughout the footprint in a very decentralized way. And we built an infrastructure over top of all of that so that we could operate in a uniform way. That was also very disruptive because we were changing practices for our employees which required retraining the whole workforce. ","So essentially all of that activity related to integration and to take a very decentralized set of assets and put them into a uniform set of assets in a very customer disruptive way will be finished by the end of 2018. It doesn't mean there is no activity going forward in 2019. There is some but the bulk of it in terms of its financial impact is behind us by the end of this year. We still have to finish the all-digital project this quarter. We still have to finish the DOCSIS 3.1 gig rollout this quarter. ","We are still putting billing systems together this quarter. And we will -- and the billing system integration will follow out a little bit into 2019, but by and large most of it\u2019s behind, particularly the customer-facing disruption will be behind us by the end of this quarter. And so going forward, our ability to execute and just a pure financial impact of not having to spend all that capital on those projects will terminate. And so it\u2019s going to be a different operating model going forward, both financially and from a physical execution perspective.","Christopher Winfrey ","And what Tom was just describing, it feels like a year and half two years now I have been talking about non-linear choppier in a quarter-over-quarter. We have been turning a lot of knobs and making a lot of changes. Some of which have an immediate positive impact. As an example last year fourth quarter we started to rollout some of the streaming products which cost less. On the other hand at different stages through all the things that Tom just described that has an impact on service transactions and churn. ","On the Internet, that customer-facing should go away in Q1. Are we at full steam in Q1? No because the impact of what we have been doing over the past few years will stick for a little bit. But I don\u2019t think it will be Q1 but I think that incremental activity goes down in Q1 and starts to a look better through the year.","Thomas Rutledge ","Well, activity is going down already, yes, and churn is going down, as we would expect. So we see the metrics -- the operating metrics and have confidence that the strategy will do what we think it will do.","Benjamin Swinburne ","That\u2019s helpful. I think that the question from myself and others are all aiming at the same thing which is we are heading towards the payoff from this acquisition and people are wondering how much revenue growth benefits to CapEx? I think is pretty straightforward. But -- and it sounds like there has been enough in the system going on that has impacted net adds maybe then ARPU and we are sort of going to come out of that. So thank you for all that color. Appreciate it.","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Ben. Michelle, take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack","Yes, thanks. Tom, just a comment we heard obviously from AT&T this week, pretty weak results of DirecTV now and significant losses on the linear TV product. I suspect we will see some results from dish as well. But just maybe your view on the overall video landscape what you're seeing out there from the over-the-top guys. If that can become a slowing threat do you think? And then purely the losses of AT&T, is that an opportunity for you guys, have you taken some share there? Thanks. ","Thomas Rutledge ","Mike, I have said it all along that I thought that the shrinking of the satellite business would benefit our video business. But then you got these another trends as well. Including recently price increases in the virtual MVPD space which probably impacted their results too. We have had competitors in the virtual MVPD space who have been selling product below cost to the peers and even they had to admit that that was driven and raised some of the rates which will impact the overall competitive landscape. ","I mean if you step up above it all and look at the whole marketplace, you still have the requirement to sell most must-have programming in fat packages and the content companies ensure to their contracts that, that retailers like us carry that product in big bundles. Were not allowed to carry it without caring other services similarly situated in the same packages or unless we don't want carry it at all. And if you look at the products sets that most MVPDs have, it\u2019s the same, they are similar. ","So that price driver and the fact that content companies have been able to price through that, puts an enormous burden on a lot of people, don't -- can't really afford a television and that affects the propensity to use passwords and other things of that nature to get product without paying for it. And by the content companies going over-the-top without having an experience of being distributors, they\u2019ve done that in way without securing the content which any distributor would theoretically do, if they knew what they were doing, but that hasn\u2019t been the case. So you have free service all over the country through passwords and yes -- and it\u2019s not always that easy to deal with and you got to deal with television and so there are impediments to that as well but the reality is television can be had fairly easily without paying for it and that\u2019s true over the Internet TV as well. If you think about people charging retransmission fees for free over the air content, eventually that drives people to get antennas. So all those forces are still out there. On the other hand, satellite is very high priced single product with $100 kind of ARPUs in a world where the content is devalued and so I think you'll see continued erosion of that business and some of that will shift to us. And the question is when you look at all of that what\u2019s the portion of that comes to us?","Mike McCormack","We are fairly sure that concerns on the password stuff. But maybe just one follow-up just on the mobile stuff. I think there's been maybe some of a dismissive attitude on the wireless carrier side. What kind of customers -- I know it\u2019s early days but what kind of customers you\u2019re picking up, is it the value seekers, is it prepaid migrations or is it really very quality -- high quality customers? Thanks.","Thomas Rutledge ","I can\u2019t describe that yet. I don't have enough information about the individual sales that we have. But look this is a fully distributed product, mobile is. It\u2019s fully penetrated and like us everybody has one and everybody wants one. And so we think that mixing those products into our product set in the right proportions and the right prices that the whole marketplace is available to us. ","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Mike. Michelle, next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from Jason Bezenett with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Bezenett ","Just a question for Mr. Winfrey. You mentioned mobility would achieve profitability once it gets to scale. As you go through sort of all the variables, mix of customers and wholesale payments and handset revenue recognition, all that stuff, what's a reasonable bid ask in terms of the low high, in terms of how many subs you think you need before it does reach profitability? ","Christopher Winfrey ","Thanks, Jason. Look the question of breakeven is somewhat academic because it has to be in a context of your growth rate. But as to the additional growth cost, we expect the mobile business on a standalone basis without the benefit of cable which we think are a significant, we would expect new growth and new benefits to cable to reach financial breakeven around 2 million mobile lines which would be when you take customer relationships into account about 5% penetration of our Internet relationships. And I don\u2019t want that to be a guidance of where we're going to breakeven because the reality is we expect to be growing and continue to grow well beyond that. ","I also think there\u2019s meaningful benefit to cable. But as an academic or analytical framework that gives you a sense of where the business needs to be but it also hopefully shows our confidence around the NPV of mobile and frankly the level of risk that we are taking on of which I've expressed in the past either going to be widely profitable and very high NPV, or relatively low cost option for the company and we can think that\u2019s going to work really well both on a standalone basis as well as creating value for cable. ","Stefan Anninger ","Michelle next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Brett Feldman ","Hi, thanks. Another wireless question. You were talking about your interest in the CBRS spectrum some of which will be available on a license basis. I'm curious if that's your desire to actually use and own the license spectrum because actual case is obviously you have to show up in dollars to gain access to it. So do you anticipate that that could be significant enough of an outlay that it might disrupt your capital returns program? And then obviously a follow-up is, if you are going to gain access to more spectrums you have to build it out. How does that factor into your outlook for material improvement in your CapEx going forward? Thanks.","Thomas Rutledge ","So Brett. First of all we don\u2019t think that spectrum will be auctioned until 2020. And so from a timing perspective that's probably the case. And one of the nice things about the way that auction will work is that it will be done on a county-by-county basis which we\u2019re pleased to see so that in terms of the need for that spectrum, the ability to bid on it in footprints that make sense to us as conventional cable operators, makes a lot of sense. ","That said there's also a free spectrum available to us. And yes there would be capital, there would be cost if you\u2019ve got spectrum and there would be capital associated with it. And back to Craig's question, it's really a question about if you had an MVNO business and had a certain cost level and you had a technological solution that was more efficient than that, gave you a return so to speak because you had less MVNO cost as a result of putting the capital out. That would be a good business opportunity. ","And so when we evaluate whether we want to buy spectrum or whether we want to put capital or put radios and CBRS, our strand or however, we want to do the deployment or physically by some location we would look at the traffic and the cost of the MVNO and say to ourselves what would the capital do from a cost perspective. If it is more efficient to spend the capital and reduce our expenditures on the MVNO, that would be good return on investment. So we will look at that as it comes up.","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks, Brett. Michelle, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay. So your final question will come from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","First, you guys have been helpful talking about the decline in capital intensity we should see as we sort of come out of this integration tunnel. And then on the call here, I think the focus has been more on sort of the revenue impact. But if we could just talk a little bit about the margin side. You have seen some margin improvement but you still trail Comcast by about 300 bps. Should we see a corresponding sort of improving trend in terms of margin increases as we get through this integration cycle because we talked about the OpEx spending that goes along with all-digital and sort of duplicative cost. So if you could give us a little bit more color there, it\u2019s not as evident as it is in the sort of the CapEx line? And then over on the business side, Chris, your comments talking about the improving revenue trends as we start annualizing some of these -- the repricing of the Time Warner cable business segment. And I think you mentioned Navisite and cell backhaul there as playing a role in the deceleration we saw this year. Can you just give us a little color on sort of what's happening there and sort of how it looks coming out of this repricing?","Thomas Rutledge ","So I'll start John, with cost to serve and margin. As we come out of the integration we pick up -- we do -- our margins -- well all other things being equal, our margins would improve as a result of the fact that our churn is going to go down. And the reason our churn is going to go down is because our service is actually better. We are not visiting customers and creating more transactions that are necessary, our repeat service call activity will go down, which means that there are less physical transactions per dollar revenue or per customer relationship. If our churn goes down because our products work better and our relationship with our customer is better and more satisfying, the product mix is correct the pricing and packaging is correct, then our churn goes down because the satisfaction goes up. That means that for the same dollar of revenue with a lower churn rate or the same customer account with the lower churn rate you have a less connects and less disconnects which means you have less activity which means you have lower cost. So we have expectations that we will have significant reductions on cost to serve. And obviously going forward technological change too and the way we\u2019ve put the company together from a scale perspective and our service infrastructure from a scale perspective, our ability to handle more customers more efficiently gets better through time. So, we expect that we will be able to generate faster EBITDA growth tan revenue growth as a result of the satisfaction that we create through the asset deployments that we've done over the last couple of years.","John Hodulik","Not just in 2019 improvement but that carries through. ","Thomas Rutledge ","It\u2019s multiple years, yes.","Christopher Winfrey ","John the question regarding enterprise, so rough order of magnitude that\u2019s $3.5 billion business and well over $600 million of it is cell backhaul and Navisite, which are flattish. That\u2019s the only point that we\u2019re bringing out that. So there is a portion of it which naturally isn\u2019t growing at the same pace as the rest of the business and the remainder is growing faster from a relationship standpoint 15% PSU growth. But the same thing that we have done in residential, that we\u2019ve done at SMB, really past year we\u2019ve been going to market in more aggressive way on pricing, around whether it's fiber Internet access or Ethernet or Metro Ethernet or voice. We\u2019ve been more aggressive in the marketplace to grow and to try to compete and accelerate growth, which is worth. But we're doing that not only with better service but better pricing and that has an impact on your revenue growth rate as the existing base comes out of contract and there\u2019s new pricing and packaging on enterprise. So same story, just a little later start and it\u2019s going to be more prolonged or slow in terms of where it bottoms out and returns to growth just given the nature of the contracts that exist in enterprise. ","Thomas Rutledge ","So there is another thing I would say about revenue growth, so just to finish that off is that we\u2019re selling in -- we're going to be selling in mobile which does have a higher revenue component to it in packaging going forward and the consumer from a total cost to them perspective will be getting savings.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Charter\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings call. This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 6:00 A.M. Eastern Time detailing our results. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our Investor & News Center.

These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Please also note that on July 1, 2013 Charter completed its acquisition of Cablevision\u2019s Bresnan Broadband Holdings, and its subsidiaries, also known as Bresnan.

Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today\u2019s call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Rutledge","Thank you, Stefan. Obviously we\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time earlier this morning discussing the transactions we\u2019ve agreed to with Comcast. And this call including Q&A, we would like to focus on Charter\u2019s performance and the impact that our operating models have in our business and our first quarter results are noteworthy in their own right.","Nearly two years ago, we reorganized Charter. We assembled a new management team, and put in a highly centralized organizational structure in place that essentially changed every job in the company in terms of responsibilities, how we measure performance, and in many cases, physical locations.","At the same time, we changed our product structure to offer high quality and competitive projects with pricing and packaging designed to drive new customer relationships with more product and revenue per household. And we fundamentally restructured the way we sell into the marketplace.","We have seen positive effects from our operating strategy for at least a year now, with faster customer relationship growth, higher triple-play sell-in, lower service call rates and longer customer lives.","It is still early that Charter has become highly competitive service provider. We are winning market share across all our products including video. And customer satisfaction levels have increased substantially, and our employees take increasing pride in the quality, product and services we provide.","As you can see in today\u2019s release, our customer see the difference, which translates into strong financial performance as we improve the fundamental blocking and tackling in a high volume transaction and services environment. We also positioned our current product set to further distance ourselves from the competition. Before I get into that, a few comments on the first quarter.","Total customer residential relationships grew by 112,000 versus 61,000 last year, an improvement of over 80%. And over the last 12 months, our residential customer base has grown by 4.1% while revenue per household grew by 2.8%. Residential sales activity improved again this quarter, growing 11% year-over-year, a function of how we put our products together and go-to-market.","Triple-play sell-in to new video customers in our legacy systems was up 57% \u2013 was 57%, up from 48% one year ago. We also continued to see improving levels of customer churn, resulting from improved service delivery and higher customer satisfaction.","In the first quarter, we added 206,000 residential PSUs versus 140,000 a year ago. And each of our PSU categories grew this quarter including video. Over the last 12 months, our expanded video customer base has grown by over 30,000 customers. Our improving video product is enabling us to take back meaningful multichannel video market share from competitors. We\u2019ll continue to grow market share to our service, operation and superior products suite under the new Charter Spectrum brand.","Compared to last year, revenue grew 7.5% year-over-year and residential revenue grew 6.5%, 50% faster than one year ago. Commercial also continued to be strong with 20% growth. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.2% year-over-year, a significant uplift from top line growth and service investments.","Looking beyond the single quarter, a few words on our product set service operations. We\u2019re currently at 40% of our all-digital initiative, and we continue to target completion by year end. Over the last six weeks, we began introducing our new product suite, Charter Spectrum in a number of markets that we\u2019ve already taken all-digital including Dallas, Fort Worth and Greenville, South Carolina.","Customers inside these markets now have access to over 200 HD channels, with digital pictures and interactive programming guide and full video-on-demand capability on every single TV out there. Minimum internet speeds of 60 megabits for new and migrated internet customers, and in some markets like St. Louis, our minimum speed will be 100 megabits. And a fully featured voice product at all highly competitive price. We\u2019re offering superior products at superior price points whether on promotion or at full price.","Moving to all analog content, encrypting the signals and placing a two-way box on every outlet in the footprint, brings significant long-term benefits, but it also is a highly disruptive operational process. We have a solid plan in place and it\u2019s going very well. In fact, we continue to see a positive impact on our customer growth performance in all-digital markets. And each customer on our new pricing and packaging structure will receive the spectrum product suite when their market goes all-digital.","So we\u2019re selling more but we\u2019re also creating longer lived customers. We\u2019re doing that with superior product and better service. Our outdoor plan is now in good shape through our investments in call center infrastructure, including increasingly insourced work force and improvement towards we are seeing fewer calls per customer, faster time to resolution and higher customer satisfaction ratings through our post call survey process. As a result, we\u2019re reducing transaction cost per customer.","We also offer better service inside the home as we insource higher levels by our work force, improve their training and give them the right tool to do their job to maintain a higher focus on craftsmanship, all of which has led to significantly higher levels of customer satisfaction, fewer transactions and a better return on our growth investments.","We continue to move forward with our cloud-based user interface development. Our new GUI has been designed to run on every set-top box we have in the field offering advanced video navigation to all outlets. It has a consistent user experience on all screen and we\u2019ve been testing to guide in employee homes and it has worked as designed. We expect to expand the guide on the customer home in certain markets by the middle of this year to ensure the scales.","We also continue to develop Charter TV app with more live feeds, video-on-demand content and other features in the coming months. During the first quarter, Charter also independently certified its new Wi-Fi router, as providing the fastest wireless service in the country compared to any competitor. We\u2019ll be launching this next generation router to customers beginning this quarter.","So over the last 24 months, we transformed Charter into a company that offers superior servicing value across its core product lines of video, internet and voice. This quarter\u2019s results indicate that if execute properly, our strategy will win us additional customers and market share including video, leading a greater EBITDA for home passed and good cash flow for our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris to provide more details on the quarter.","Tom Rutledge","Thanks, Tom. As a reminder, unless otherwise stated, the results we\u2019re discussing and showing in today\u2019s slides are presented on a pro forma basis as if we had acquired Bresnan on January 1, 2012. Our first quarter operating and financial results clearly demonstrates that our business is performing well and as expected.","Turning to Slide 4 of today\u2019s presentation, residential PSU net adds grew by nearly 50% and commercial net adds were also up. We gained 18,000 residential video customers during the first quarter versus a loss of 25,000 last year, a 43,000 improvement.","Our first question residential video customer net adds, included approximately 16,000 bulk digital upgrades. These are existing Charter residential video customers in bulk sales arrangements that haven\u2019t had a set-top box or direct billing relationship with Charter in the past. As we transition to all-digital, these customers become included in our residential video customer accounts.","We have provided data on today\u2019s trending schedule that shows the impact of bulk digital upgrades on our quarterly video customer net adds. Excluding the impact of 16,000 bulk digital upgrades in the first quarter, and 5,000 last year, we gained 2,000 in regular residential video customers this quarter, as compared to loss of 30,000 on a similar basis during the first quarter of last year.","In internet, we added 136,000 residential customers, which is a 107,000 during the first quarter last year. And we added 52,000 residential voice customers versus 58,000 last year.","While our residential customer base grew by 4.1%, revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.8% year-over-year, driven by higher product sell-in, rate adjustments including retrans and box fees and higher average dollars step-ups and better retention at promotional roll-off for customers that we acquired approximately 12 months ago inside of our new pricing and packaging.","At the end of the first quarter, 75% of our customer base outside of Bresnan was in our new pricing and packaging.","And Slide 6 shows our accelerating customer growth combined with our continued ARPU growth resulted in residential revenue growth of 6.5% year-over-year. That compares to 1.3% just two years ago.","Looking at commercial, we added 14,000 PSUs versus 7,000 last year. Commercial revenue grew by 20%, driven primarily by small business, and excluding the lower growth video base commercial revenue grew by 24.5%.","Turning to expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. Programming expense grew by $60 million accounting for about 60% of the total increase in operating expense versus the prior year quarter. Programming costs grew by 11% on an absolute basis including 1% expanded video customer growth.","The expense growth was consistent with our expectations and driven by contractual rate increases, including a couple of large renewals, as well as the mix shift in expanded base of customers over the last 12 months and the lack of video losses generally.","Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, network operations and customer care costs, was flat year-over-year, as our deferred maintenance program is now complete and we start to see the benefits of insourcing investments in lower transactions.","On a market-by-market basis, as we go all-digital, we see higher activity in the transition month but in general, we\u2019re reducing transaction cost per dollar of revenue that we generate.","Marketing spend increased by $14 million, up 12% year-over-year, given continued sales channel development and consistent with the higher sales activity. Other costs grew by $24 million or 15% year-over-year, driven by higher labor cost to support commercial revenue, as well as the corporate expense. In total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $52 million or 7.3 % year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 8, first quarter capital expenditures totaled $539 million, about 60% of that spending was driven by CPE to support our all-digital initiative and new customer acquisition. Specifically $119 million were CapEx that was dedicated to our all-digital initiative, with most of that spend inside CPE. We also spent $59 million on commercial CapEx. That figures excludes any all-digital spend for commercial properties. In the full year 2014, we continue to expect approximately $2.2 billion in capital expenditures.","Let me put that spend in perspective. If you take $2.2 billion in the debt before $100 million one-time all digital spend, which makes us more competitive, it has discrete revenue attached to it. And then we deduct the $100 million of insourcing capital I mentioned on our last call, we\u2019re left with about $1.7 billion of spend.","Conventional 2013 capital expenditure for our commercial business, about $300 million last year and just used that as a proxy, we are now down to about $1.4 billion in capital expenditures for residential business with an expected high growth rate. So we\u2019re very comfortable with our level of spend relative to our current growth rates and one-time all-digital.","We generated $74 million free cash flow in the quarter compared to $118 million during the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by higher capital spending and the timing of cash paid for interest, partially offset by our higher adjusted EBITDA and the working capital benefit from the timing of CapEx payments.","We ended the quarter with $14 billion of net debt and our leverage ratio is 12x to 4.7x on an LTM basis. Just above our target leverage ratio of 4x to 4.5x. Our weighted average borrowing cost remains 5.6% and Slide 10 shows the weighted average life of our debt is now 7.2 years with over 95% of that debt maturing beyond 2016. We finished the quarter with $1.2 billion of available liquidity.","Turning to Slide 11. Our tax assets continue to offer us significant value. And as I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we\u2019ve actually grown not only from last year\u2019s Bresnan acquisition, but we also liquidated one of our tax partnerships resulted in a step-up of our tax basis of approximately $400 million and freed up some NOL. As a result, after M&A including what we discussed this morning, we do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer until after 2018, full year later than our previously disclosed estimate.","Today\u2019s transactions that we announced are expected to accelerate that utilization and the present value of our significant tax assets.","As we look towards the balance of the year, we remain well positioned to continue to execute on our operating plan. We also have a lot of listing in front of us to close and implement the transactions we announced with Comcast this morning. But as Tom mentioned at the outset, we\u2019d like to focus our Q&A here on Charter\u2019s first quarter operating and financial results and we will refrain from replicating the call that we had earlier today.","And so I\u2019m now happy to hand it over to the operator and open it up for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Wlodarczak \u2013 Pivotal Research Group","Good morning guys. I\u2019ll refrain from asking about the transaction although it\u2019s going to be tough. Tom, obviously second quarter is seasonally weak for you all, but do you believe we\u2019re near the point in your markets where you can sustainably begin growing your video sub base as you take back shift to satellite? I have a follow-up.","Tom Rutledge","Well, I guess I\u2019m not going to forecast our video growth for the rest of the year, since we haven\u2019t given guidance on it, but as a general proposition, yes, that there is seasonality in our numbers. And we\u2019re growing, but we are not growing that fast yet but our momentum is good. And so I have expectations that we can grow our video business on a year-over-year basis and \u2013 but with the recognition that there is still seasonality inside of our business.","Jeff Wlodarczak \u2013 Pivotal Research Group","Thanks. And then, both AT&T and Verizon had very weak first quarter results, especially relative to you and Comcast. Both have noted that they are going to give materially more aggressive to try to reaccelerate their growth. Has your competitive intensity changed recently, and any other color you can give us on trends in the second quarter would be helpful. Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","I haven\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t describe the market is different. It\u2019s a highly dependent marketplace and a variety of competitors in it, who are offering different promotions at different points in time, but we think in aggregate that we have a very good product that stands up competitively and that our service operation and ourselves bunching \u2013 put some pretty strong competitive posture and we think that gives us the ability to grow.","Jeff Wlodarczak \u2013 Pivotal Research Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vijay\u00a0Jayant with International Strategy and Investment Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay\u00a0Jayant \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. Looks like this is like the first quarter we\u2019ve seen where we\u2019ve started to see real operating leverage. Can you sort of give us some direction, is this the new path? I mean, have we sort of annualized or calendarize the step-ups and costs and this is the run rate. Obviously your marketing costs were higher, but costs of servicing customers seem to sort of normalize?","Chris Winfrey","Hi, Vijay. It\u2019s Chris. I think and maybe the first one that you\u2019re saying is that we\u2019ve been seeing it for quite some time. If you take a look at the amount of growth\u00a0rate that we\u2019ve had increasing for several quarters now. That drives additional one-time expenditure for that relative amounts of year-over-year growth. And marketing sales reaching at all that type of activity, all of which is investment that you\u2019re not happy to make happen. So it\u2019s not just in CapEx, it\u2019s in OpEx as well.","And we\u2019ve been describing that that\u2019s what\u2019s been taking place this past several quarters as we continue to have higher growth. We still have higher growth this quarter, but all of that growth momentum was inside the P&L. And yes, if you just look simplistically at the pace of it, we\u2019re starting to see that benefit. There is not any strange one-time effect taking place inside Q1 this year.","So it\u2019s faired representative of what we\u2019ve been doing for a long period of time. But it\u2019s also representing in the same areas, step-up with growth rates in the expenditures to drive that. So I think the underlying EBITDA as I mentioned over the last call is significantly stronger than anything what we show, given the amount of growth that we\u2019re investing in.","Vijay\u00a0Jayant \u2013 ISI Group","And in fact just to follow-up, programming costs of subs seems like 13%. Is that sort of the low double-digit number we should think about for the year, or was there some timing on that cost?","Chris Winfrey","Well, I am not exactly sure if you are looking at perhaps too simplistically. Programming costs year-over-year are up by 11%. Our standard basic customer relationships were up by 1%, which means our rate base increasing programming costs of around 10% which is consistent with what we said that we would expect for 2014 to look somewhat similar to our peers and competitors. So the key difference being that we\u2019re growing. And if you\u2019re growing, you\u2019re not only going have to rate increase, but you have volume increase. It\u2019s not something that we should be all pretty happy about.","Vijay\u00a0Jayant \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan\u00a0Chaplin \u2013 New Street Research","Thanks very much. Just to follow-up quickly on Jeff\u2019s question. It looks like your flow share this quarter must have \u2013 again to the AT&T and Verizon has improved quite nicely from last quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more context on what the shift was from last quarter to this quarter that drove better more effective share gains? Was it just the accumulation of all the things that you\u2019ve been doing in terms of improving the systems and customer care and the programming packages and the pricing that also showed up more definitively in one quarter, or were there some other specific issues that you can point to?","Tom Rutledge","Chaplin, I think that our competitive posture and our improvement and ability to sell has been not a quarter-to-quarter kind of outcome, but the result of a consistent approach to the marketplace that has been building for quite some time. And the results of improved satisfaction, reduced churn, less transactions per customer translate into financial performance as you move down the road. And so the financial performance actually lags the operating performance. And we\u2019ve been seeing the operating improvements for quite sometime.","In terms of flow shore, the only thing I would say is that the number of phone customers who have video inside of our footprint is a fairly small numbers. A vast majority of the video customers that we \u2013 that are competitive to us inside of our footprint are provided by satellite companies.","Jonathan\u00a0Chaplin \u2013 New Street Research","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason\u00a0Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason\u00a0Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup","Just a quick for Mr. Rutledge. You guys have talked a lot about the number of changes, the wide array of changes you have made. But I was wondering, within your footprint, if you look at the 40% that you said, it\u2019s all-digital, but is that portion of your footprint demonstrably different in terms of the operational or financial results versus the 60% that is you have to go all-digital? Thank you.","Tom Rutledge","It\u2019s different, but not hugely different. And the reason it\u2019s not hugely different is most of it is relatively recently transformed from the current operating model to an all-digital model. And so yes, we\u2019re getting better results inside the all-digital footprint, nice growth, but it\u2019s relatively recent. And we\u2019re getting growth across the entire footprint.","Jason\u00a0Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig\u00a0Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig\u00a0Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Hi. A question on CapEx for Tom and Chris. Tom, you said that your new IP guide will be available on all outlets. As far as I know that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve formally committed to that. Does that change your long-term CapEx expectations for the number of IP-enabled set-top boxes you might otherwise have needed? Chris, if I take your numbers for the $1.4 billion normal, that\u2019s about 15%, 16% CapEx to sales ratio. How well could that get, or is that kind of the long-term run rate?","Tom Rutledge","So let me take the first part of that, Craig. First of all, the ideas that every outlet that Charter has and involve digital footprint has a two-way interactive set-top box capable of video-on-demand and other interactive functions. All the new boxes we\u2019re buying have DOCSIS modems in them and can display an IP-based call-based guide.","We\u2019re also working though, i.e., backwardly compatible technology using active video and other software from other companies like Zodiac and others that allows already deployment MPEG boxes that don\u2019t have DOCSIS modems in them to have the interactive call-based guide using the MPEG platform.","And that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing. And if that works the way that we hope it does and the way so far the test indicated it will, we\u2019ll be able to put that user interface on all boxes without having to buy new boxes. So Chris?","Chris Winfrey","So the second question was around capital intensity. And look, we\u2019ve consistently said, there is nothing structurally different at Charter that will drive the different capital intensity measured as a percentage of revenue, other than all-digital, the insourcing activities that we\u2019re doing this year which is why we\u2019ve split those out and separated them. The difference I think between the percentage that you listed where have some others have gotten to that is growing.","And so the answer to your question is that, we can go a lot lower but I don\u2019t think we want to, because it would mean that we\u2019re not growing. And if we\u2019re going to be acquiring additional customers, triple-play customers, there is installation cost and CPE, and all of that has revenue, as I\u2019m sure, attached to it and its very good ROI. But absent that growth, yes, you can see it go lower but it\u2019s not to go.","Tom Rutledge","But as a general proposition, capital intensity is coming down for other factors like the cost of set-top boxes. And we continue to make improvements in our ability to buy boxes. We have a downloadable security system that we\u2019ve developed. We\u2019re buying integrated boxes currently. And as a result of that, both the volume and the technology platform that we\u2019re deploying, our cost per digitally deployed box is going down.","Craig\u00a0Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan\u00a0Kraft with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Bryan\u00a0Kraft \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi. Just want to ask on the insourcing effort, Chris. Can you just talk about how that impacts the P&L. And sort of you when you\u2019re absorbing the cost and when you\u2019ll start to see leverage from that? And also in which category or categories is the CapEx related to that effort being reported? And also want to see if I could ask one other one on churn. Just wondering if you can quantify, even if it\u2019s just a rough percentage terms, just how much you\u2019ve been able to bring the churn down since you started the turnaround effort? Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","So two questions you had on insourcing. One is the P&L impact. We\u2019ve been insourcing gradually for a long period of time, really since Q3 2012. And the net effect of that is you\u2019re increasing your cost from the P&L perspective as you have higher cost labor but the offset to that is overtime you reduce the number of transactions per customers, which means that you can have an expensive phone call that have less outcome [ph] and have less costs inside your P&L. And that takes time to build up capabilities and to have a swing from the investment to neutral, which is kind of where we\u2019re at today, to turn into benefit which is where we\u2019d like to go overtime.","The same philosophy exists as it relates to field operations and physical labor. And that\u2019s been taken place similarly since late 2012. Both of those categories are the major categories you asked, have increased the amount of the in-house labor activity that\u2019s been used as close to offshore or outsourced labor.","And so you can take a look at Q1 P&L, the cost of surge includes field operations, network operations and customer care. And that\u2019s been primarily \u2013 you can see the year-over-year flat, despite the fact that we\u2019ve had substantial customer revenue growth and that shows that the ever growing cost of service that\u2019s hitting the operating leverage, despite the ongoing investments that we\u2019re making to continue to insource.","In CapEx, its fleet tools, test, trucks, equipment and the real estate to house those people falling aside to support line inside of CapEx. And you\u2019ll see some chunkiness for lack of a better word, as we go along and see, how trucks are ordered and how buildings are built and those type of things, but it\u2019s that category that\u2019s incurring that $100 million spend. So that was on that.","And churns, actually we don\u2019t publish the churn number consistent with our peers. But it\u2019s safe to say that once the month has varies high single-digits to double-digit improvement in terms of trend reduction year-over-year. We get as you would expect in a blips in market-by-market as we grow all-digital. So really we\u2019re not talking about that impact, and we\u2019ve got the normalized effect absent the one time impact of taking a market all-digital, which has been offset by higher sales in growth coming out the other side.","Bryan\u00a0Kraft \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thanks very much, Chris.","Chris Winfrey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Amy\u00a0Yong with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong \u2013 Macquarie Research","Thanks. I have a question on pricing. Can you just lay out the roadmap for ARPU growth? At what point will ARPU exceed volume growth? And as you rollout Spectrum and all-digital, are you seeing up-selling within your customer base? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","When will pricing growth exceed volume growth? That\u2019s the fundamental question you had? I hope it\u2019s a long-winded way. So I don\u2019t think we want to forecast that, but our objective fundamentally is to create customer relationships and superior competitive product. And you can see already that we\u2019re growing relationships on an annual rate of 4%. And our actual volume growth is substantially less than from an ARPU perspective. And we like it that way. We take a market share driven strategy.","Chris Winfrey","And Amy your second question was on Spectrum. It\u2019s just been introduced. So it\u2019s far too early to make comments or speculate or give a measure. So we look forward to talking about it generally in future, but there is no data as of yet.","Amy Yong \u2013 Macquarie Research","Okay. Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. I have two. Chris, on the ARPU front, I think last quarter you talked about some modest headwinds from migrations of more a price sensitive customer, even though if that was material to the Q1 ARPU result. If you could help us think about that? And then I have a follow-up.","Chris Winfrey","The same trend exists. And so as I mentioned at the time, you have the barbells of transactions. One is, what\u2019s the ARPU that you\u2019re reporting at? The other one is that what\u2019s the ARPU those customers are disconnecting, but the vast majority \u2013 not the vast, but the majority of transactions taking place in the middle which is upgrades, downgrades and migrations. And we\u2019ve had a lot of that. I wouldn\u2019t try to read too much into one particular quarter\u2019s movement in those middle categories.","The key point is that more of our customers are on new pricing and packaging. They have a better product, they have a better service. They are more competitive in relative to other offers and they\u2019ll be longer lives. So even if they cost us a dollar or two for those migrations in a particular quarter, you\u2019re much better off in that. That was the point that we\u2019re making last quarter.","Some of those trends still continue. We\u2019re now at 75% excluding Bresnan and it should start to slow. And that\u2019s really benefited us both from churn as well as stabilizing better impact to ARPU overtime.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. That\u2019s what I was thinking. Okay. And then Tom, kind of a bigger picture question around over-the-top video in the context of what a lot of people are speculating Dish may do and you compete with Dish obviously quite a bit on the video side, but if they launched sort of this $30 skinny video over-the-top, bundle that with Disney contract, which as they may. I\u2019m curious from a Charter perspective, how you see that product versus what you offer? Is there a competitive response you think at the lower end of the market that you need to do? And then as an ISP which is this product would be great for your broadband business given how much traffic it would drive, how do you feel about the position of the ISP in the context of net neutrality and all those who buzz around ISP interconnect all that stuff, if you have a service coming over-the-top of your own network that drives a ton of capacity. So it\u2019s a linear video service. So I know it\u2019s a lot, but I was just curious. Love to get your thoughts on how do you think about those things?","Tom Rutledge","Okay. Here is a lot. First of all, I don\u2019t know what Dish is going to do but my understanding of their agreement with Disney is that it\u2019s contingent other services being available and they may or may not be. And I believe that we have similar opportunities to do the same kind of services with Disney that Dish has.","And with regard to over-the-top in general and the use of our network, no, that\u2019s a general issue, but we support net neutrality as a company, and we are able to use our network and to expand the capabilities, to make our internet service valuable to customers. And our general view is that while the video business may change through time and products may come in the traditional cable service and they may come from on-demand providers and service providers like Netflix and potentially Dish or anyone else who \u2013 we\u2019re comfortable with that, and the fact that we have a better ISP we think for a variety of reasons, including our plant capabilities and our service offering and our price, and things that there is an opportunity to grow our business, however the video business evolves.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Denis Kelleher \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hi. This is Denis Kelleher in for James. Two if I could. First, could you give us a sense for what subscriber trends in the 40% of your footprint is now digital, are you taking share here, and is there any way you can quantify payback to that on your video net add performance this quarter? And secondly, just any color around the ARPU pick-up you saw in telephony? Thanks very much.","Chris Winfrey","So look, we\u2019re not going to get into market-by-market specifics, but as we\u2019ve said that in our markets performance has improved year-over-year whether it\u2019s going all-digital or not and that the performance is even better were have gone all-digital despite the disruption that Tom talked about at the point of transition. So we think it\u2019s all positive.","Your second question related to what, telephony ARPU?","Denis Kelleher \u2013 Buckingham Research","Yes. Just a bit growth you saw this quarter.","Chris Winfrey","Growth in telephony ARPU?","Denis Kelleher \u2013 Buckingham Research","That\u2019s right.","Chris Winfrey","Okay. We\u2019re selling a triple-play package. And so in some sense, telephony; one, we don\u2019t report telephony ARPU. So that\u2019s going to be pretty compelling what we think of that, because we\u2019re selling the triple-play package, and depending on how we allocate technology \u2013 if you talk about growth in telephony ARPU or decline in telephony ARPU, in some sense it\u2019s irrelevant because it\u2019s just how we sell that product.","This existing customer is a very small portion of our base that actually pays telephony on a stand-alone basis. And so it\u2019s almost irrelevant. I think the right way to think about this is look at residential customer ARPU and watch the trends and how is that developing, what\u2019s the overall penetration by bundle.","Denis Kelleher \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","That was our last question. Thanks for joining us today. And operator, I\u2019ll pass it back to you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect."],"5163":["Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November  5, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Stefan Anninger - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thomas M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Charter's 2013 Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.","Stefan Anninger","Good morning, and welcome to Charter's 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our Investor & News Center. The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risks factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Please also note that on July 1, Charter completed its acquisition of Cablevision's Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, also known as Bresnan. Unless otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to on this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2011. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Stefan. Charter performed well again this quarter, and residential revenue growth continued to accelerate. Our total third quarter revenue grew by 5.4% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of advertising, revenue grew by 6.4%. Our residential revenue growth rate improved to 5.1% versus 1.6% last year.","We grew residential customer relationships by 46,000 this quarter, nearly double the growth that we saw last year, and we added 100,000 PSUs during the quarter versus 60,000 in last year's third quarter. Both video and Internet performed better, with a 44,000 improvement in video. Our commercial segment continues to perform well and again grew by over 20%. And finally, our adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.3% compared to just under 1% last year.","These results include Bresnan on a pro forma basis for the prior year comparison. The Bresnan asset is everything we expected. However, during the ownership transition, Bresnan lost some of its growth momentum and only grew by 3.9% in the quarter. We're stepping back up the effort across all sales channels and are already seeing better subscriber results and the asset will return to its growth potential. The combined effect of temporary lower growth and the expense to restart the growth at Bresnan means that our legacy system's performance during the quarter was slightly better than the pro forma numbers indicate.","The third quarter marked an important milestone for Charter, the anniversary of the launch of our new pricing and packaging. 62% of our legacy residential customers are now on our new pricing and packaging structure, meaning that over half of these customers are receiving the superior product set with far more value. One of our key goals is to produce higher-quality, long-term relationships with our customers by simplifying our pricing and by providing more value in our offers. It is working. At customers' 1-year anniversary under new product and pricing, we're seeing higher average dollar step-ups at promotional roll-off and better retention rates given an improved product set and customer experience. Better retention, higher step-ups, increasing sales and higher levels of product selling at point-of-sale are clearly driving revenue growth. And the higher year-over-year sales are increasingly triple-play. During the quarter, triple-play sell-in was 54% of video sales, 20% higher than last year, which all of what we sell now is expanded basic, which is 100% fully featured video product on a 2-way interactive plan and offers an interactive guide in over 10,000 Video On Demand choices.","Our Internet product is also performing well, and approximately 70% of our Internet customer base now receives data speeds 30 megabits or more. We will significantly increase that speed as we go all digital.","Our service levels and the efficiency of our core operation also continues to improve, and we're seeing that in our metrics. For instance, in the third quarter, service call truck rolls fell by 16% year-over-year, with repeat service rates falling by a similar amount. Ultimately, these improving service metrics mean fewer transactions resulting in lower cost and churn, driving higher market share with better margins.","During the quarter, we continued our all-digital initiative in a number of our markets, including portions of California and Michigan, and we now offer over 170 high-definition channels in these markets. We also initiated all-digital migration in other areas, including Greenville, South Carolina. We continue to see a positive impact on our performance in those markets. We're taking our plant all-digital, including better PSU growth.","Slide 3 details the benefits that all digital provides and graphically displays the plant capacity that this project frees up on our network.","Before I turn the call over to Chris, a few comments on our new products. Today, we launched our new Charter TV app, which acts as an IP user guide and allows for streaming of over 100 live channels inside the home. The application will first be available on Apple devices and will be later made available on Android devices. We anticipate adding more features to the application including VOD content that will be available to our video customers both inside and outside the home.","We're also testing our new cloud-based user interface for new and existing boxes. The new interface will move key product and service functionality out of the set-top box and into our network. The objective is to provide a consistent cloud-based user interface across all devices and avoid customer disruption by making existing equipment work without additional capital spend for replacement CPE.","We have a full slate of further product enhancements on the agenda for 2014, and we'll be spending more time discussing them as we get closer to rollouts. So I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the direction we're heading.","Now I'll turn it over to Chris to provide additional details on our third quarter results.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. As a reminder, unless otherwise stated, the results we are discussing and shown in today's slides are presented on a pro forma basis, as if we had acquired Bresnan on January 1, 2011. Bresnan represents approximately 6% of our revenue base, and we felt the pro forma presentation was the most transparent way to discuss our operating performance.","Our third quarter 10-Q, which we filed this morning, reports our results on an actual basis. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we've also posted trending schedules showing our results on both a pro forma and an actual basis.","Turning to Slide 4 of today's presentation. Total customer and PSU trends improved across our residential and commercial businesses during the third quarter compared to the prior year. Total residential connects improved year-over-year and sequentially. We lost 27,000 video customers during the quarter versus 71,000 last year, a 44,000 improvement.","Over the last 12 months, our base of residential expanded basic customers has been nearly flat on a pro forma basis and grew slightly, excluding Bresnan. Expanded customers now constitute 94% of our video customers with just 260,000 limited basic consumers remain, including Bresnan. We added 86,000 Internet customers this quarter versus 77,000 last year. And we added 41,000 phone customers during the quarter versus 54,000 in the third quarter of 2012, when our new triple-play offer was first launched.","Our residential customer relationships grew by 2.5% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.8%, reflecting our strategy. On a sequential basis, ARPU was flat due to back-to-school seasonality, which offset promotional roll-off benefits. The net result is that our residential revenue grew by 5.1%, including a lower 2.7% at Bresnan for the reasons Tom mentioned. Excluding Bresnan, Charter grew residential revenue by 5.3%, more than tripling last year's residential revenue growth.","So the revenue acceleration we expected is taking place. I think Slide 6 does a good job of showing the operating strategy impact on Charter systems, excluding Bresnan, for the past 7 quarters, whether you look at the results for total revenue, revenue excluding advertising or just residential revenue growth.","Clearly, growing customer relationships and turning the video business is the key driver, but we're growing market share across all of our products and expanding revenue per household.","Looking at commercial, we added 21,000 PSUs versus 20,000 a year ago, and commercial revenue grew by 20.4% and over 25% if you exclude the lower growth of video base in commercial. We expect continued success in the $9.5 million B2B communications market in our footprint when we offer more value to business customers.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA and expenses on Slide 7. Programming grew by $30 million and accounted for over 40% of the increase in total operating expense growth year-over-year. On a per expanded basic customer basis, programming cost grew by 5.8%. Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, network operations and customer care cost, grew by 4.2%. As expected, the expense growth in this category has begun to normalize as ongoing service quality investments are now offset by a reduction in the onetime deferred plant maintenance incurred in the previous quarters. The higher overall level of investment is designed to provide a better service. And in fact, by spending more per transaction, we can, as Tom mentioned, reduce the number of transactions, reduce churn, grow market share and revenue with a better margin over time. Higher reconnect expense tied to higher sales also picked up in this line item.","Similarly, marketing spend is higher during the quarter given the higher sales activities and channel development, which we see as good news. So in total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $37 million or 5.3% year-over-year on 5.4% revenue growth.","Looking at Slide 8, capital expenditures totaled $425 million during the quarter or roughly 20% of revenue. Approximately 45% of total CapEx was driven by CPE to support new customer acquisitions, upgrades and digital box migration of existing customers. And the onetime effect of digital migration will become an even larger driver of our CPE spend through 2014 when we expect the project to be complete.","The dollars we spend on CPE is an excellent indicator of future success, as this spending should drive higher revenue growth, longer customer lines and better customer ROIs, and we continue to achieve substantially better CPE unit pricing resulting in an even higher ROI. Commercial CapEx represented 17% of our total CapEx in the quarter. While we expect commercial services to continue to grow at its current rate, we anticipate its capital intensity to decline starting next year. A cell backhaul focuses more on second tenant spend versus new build. For the full year 2013, we continue to expect capital expenditures to total $1.8 billion, including the impact of Bresnan, which means we expect seasonality and all-digital spend inside Q4.","Free cash flow for the third quarter was $132 million compared to negative free cash flow of $17 million on an actual basis during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher EBITDA, a decrease in capital expenditures and higher contribution from trade working capital.","We ended the quarter with $14.3 billion in net debt and a leverage ratio of 4.9x on a 12-month basis. Our weighted average borrowing cost is now only 5.6%, and in Slide 10 shows the weighted average life of our debt to 7.7 years with over 95% maturing beyond 2016.","Our target leverage remains 4 to 4.5x, and we're willing to temporarily go above or below to pursue strategic opportunities as we have in the past with Bresnan, organic growth investments and targeted share buybacks.","I'm frequently asked how we determine our target leverage range. And while we look at the WACC curve at current market rates, we take a more holistic view relative to the overall business and capital structure. We include a number of other factors which are just as important, specifically our maturity profile, the cost of our debt and the expected organic growth rate of our business.","A further factor impacting our philosophy and tolerance for leverage is our significant tax assets where $1 of EBITDA Charter is not the same as $1 of EBITDA elsewhere given our significant loss carryforwards and our outsized tax basis. Our higher tax basis relative to our peers is effectively an embedded NOL as the depreciation and amortization shields Charter from cash tax liabilities in the same fashion as an NOL, acting as a direct offset to taxable income translating into more NOL and extending the useful life of existing NOLs.","Slide 11 shows our tax assets updated both for the Liberty transaction, which closed in May, and the Bresnan transaction, which closed on July 1. As we stated before, we don't expect the change in ownership as defined under Section 382 in the tax code and triggered by the Liberty transaction to impact the net present value of our tax assets.","Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Looks like you guys had some strong PSU results. Can you talk about, one, just how the price-ups of customers on the new pricing and packaging translated into churn or your conversion rate there? And then it doesn't look like you saw much competition from increasing speeds or the excess promotion that we're seeing from U-verse. But if you could talk about that, the impact that you might have seen there and if you expect any impact from their new $15 offer for high-speed data services going forward.","Thomas M. Rutledge","John, this is Tom. We started new pricing and product rollout a year ago, July, and began selling those customers promotional packages. And those packages have started to step up in the third quarter of this year. And we're seeing good results in terms of the kind of attention we expected and the kind of revenue step-ups we expected on that customer base. And so while I don't want to break out the specific churn rates of any segment of our customer base, we're getting the kind of results that we expected in the step-up process. With regard to U-verse, their footprint inside of our service area is still less than 30%, and we've seen a slight change in that, but not a significant change. And I didn't understand the last question about the offer, but I'm not aware of any specific offers that are having a significant impact on us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So the first question was on the allocation between telephone revenues and the other lines. Just wanted to understand how much the impact within -- with your line and the broadband line was because of the allocation. And secondly, purely in terms of the churn, when we look at expanded basic trend becoming bigger and even positive in terms of net adds, would that begin to have some kind of an impact on programming cost going forward?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So Kannan, the first question on allocation, it certainly is taking place. I mean, if you take a look at year-over-year, the phone subscriber development is significant, and at the same time that we've had significant amount of net adds both in the quarter. And over the past 12 months, you've seen revenue decline, and all of that, effectively, is coming out of revenue allocation and that moves into primarily video and also as well to Internet. We don't provide a breakout on it. I think the reality is that over time, you just need to start thinking about it as a residential revenue business as opposed to specific product lines. And one of the reasons that we ceased to provide product ARPU as a reporting stat and went to providing bundling statistics and overall residential ARPUs, that's how we're running the business. That's how we're thinking about the business and driving total revenue per home passed and we think that's a much better indicator of the success that we're having. So there's a significant amount of revenue that flows out just from an allocation standpoint, first, because it's the way it's presented on the bill for pricing and packaging, which now 62% of our customers are in that new pricing and packaging. And secondly, because GAAP applies, U.S. GAAP applies further formula for allocating revenue, none of which, frankly, is really helpful for the investor community and that's not how we're running the business internally. We think about it in terms of customer revenue and revenue per household. Hopefully, that's what the market can start looking to as well, particularly the Charter strategy. On the expanded basic side?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, your question about programming cost is correct. Expanded basic costs money but it also has revenue associated with it. And so if you grow, your per unit cost of programming will go up. There's no question about that, but so did your revenues and so is your opportunities to sell additional products.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just one follow-up, if I may. I mean, this is on the pricing architecture across your product. We have seen some new initiatives across the industry in terms of Comcast trying to bundle HBO with their Internet and so on. And there's been conversation about some of the over-the-top platforms like Netflix coming through the set-top box and so on. So are some of those pricing architecture something that you guys are considering as well?","Christopher L. Winfrey","We have no plans on changing our current go-to-market strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with International Strategy Investment Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to understand what kind of lift you're really seeing. You talked about positive PSUs in your all-digital market. Are you actually even adding video subs as you roll out your offers there? And just the same question I ask probably every quarter which is, your cost to service subscribers, that's the big cost structure step-up apart from programming. I mean, is there any way to give us any color on how much of that is certain onetime items that as you -- all your initiatives sort of play out, we could see the step-down? And any color on timing on that will be fantastic.","Thomas M. Rutledge","I think, if I understand your question with regard to video, do we expect to grow video and...","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The growth in video subs and your new all-digital markets, when you...","Thomas M. Rutledge","Oh, yes, yes. In fact, we are in the -- on average, in the places where we've gone all digital, we have been growing video customers, and we expect to, over time, grow video customers. Our video product has been challenged. And part of our strategy over the last 1.5 years has been to invest in our video product to make it superior to our competitors' products. And on the increment, it is. We still have existing customers though who have an inferior product set and we're in the process of upgrading them to all digital and to our price and packaging combination. As a result of that, we expect to begin to grow video, as well as broadband and voice. And with regard to costs in the business, we have had onetime costs throughout this P&L associated with the maintenance of the plant and the restaging of our service operation, and that is showing up in capital and it's showing up in operating expense. Service calls are coming down and service -- as they come down, costs come out of the business. So I look at the cost structures that we've deployed as being somewhat temporary in nature, and ultimately, we expect our margins to go up as a result of declining service costs.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You guys have continued to target year-end '14 to complete the all-digital initiative. And without talking about the dollar amount that's associated with that, is there any way you could share the percentage of that all-digital capital outlay that will still -- that will remain in 2014? In other words, what percentage of that capital outlay would you have completed by the end of '13?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I don't have the exact percentage, but the vast majority of it.","Christopher L. Winfrey","By 2014.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. It'll all be completed by the end of '14 in our current plan, and we are not -- we have more to spend next year in terms of volume than we have this year.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I guess, just in terms of the commentary that Chris made during the prepared remarks, you said the CPE will make up a bigger portion, a bigger percentage of this -- of the CapEx mix in '14 versus '13?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's because of all digital?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes. So Jason, just to give a little additional color there, I mean, it's going to be a minority of our footprint, a small minority of our footprint that'll be all digital this year, and the bulk of the work is going to take place inside 2014. The bulk of the traditional all-digital spend will be there. Having said that, I wouldn't discount the amount of all-digital embedded activity that's taking place really at the back half of 2012 and all-year 2013, as we've had customers migrate into new pricing and packaging. We've been placing more boxes on existing customers. And in addition to that, when we add new customers, we've been putting more boxes onto those accounts than we have in the past. And what that does is that it removes some of the spend that would otherwise have to take place anyway inside of 2014. Having said all that, the bulk of the CPE spend associated to the forced all digital is really going to be taking place in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I had a follow-up to an earlier question. Is it fair to say that the effects from the third quarter promotional price increases was heavily weighted towards September, given the lack of activity in July and August? If that's the case, shouldn't we see the majority of the benefits start to really show up in the fourth quarter?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Your question, Jeff, is a seasonality one. Yes, with the back-to-school and moving season, you tend to see more at the end of August and September. I think the bigger impact here is you're thinking about the ARPU effect inside the quarters. But because you do have the back-to-school seasonality, if you look at what happened in Q2, Q3 of last year, despite us being brand-new with new pricing and packaging for the more valuable offer in the marketplace, you do end up having a little bit more single and double-play digital back-to-school seasonality and that falls down at your selling rate that takes place during Q3. And so some of the roll-off benefits that have occurred were partially offset by the back-to-school seasonality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I know you're still very careful that things scale satisfactorily because you're still repairing the Charter brand to a certain extent. Can you talk about the CloudTV H5 platform of ActiveVideo and how tentative you'll be with that and how confident you are? And then if you can just provide us a generic comment on WiFis that some of your compadres at some other companies are having pretty good success. I know you've got a particular perspective on it.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Right. Look, we are standing up a test for a cloud-based user interface, and we're confident that a cloud-based user interface can work and add a lot of value. We've looked at the Comcast X1 guide, which we think is a really nice user interface and adds a lot of value to their product. That's a cloud-based user interface using IP and the DOCSIS modem in the box. And the cloud-based user interface that we're standing up is capable of doing that, as well as we're doing an experiment with ActiveVideo to try to take a cloud-based guide to our existing base of boxes using MPEG, which is the format that those boxes -- the digital format that those boxes can look at. And we're working with ActiveVideo, we're working with Zodiac and we've built software that we think can work on an existing set-top box with our DOCSIS modem in it and still provide a high-quality cloud-based user interface. We're going to test that beginning in Fort Worth in the next few days. We'll start those tests in our employee homes. By the end of the year, they'll be in customer homes. And assuming that our theory works, we'll begin to test that and deploy that sometime in the second quarter or late second quarter of '14. So that's our timeline of thinking on cloud-based user interfaces. I should note that a substantial portion of our legacy box inventory that's already been placed in the field have DOCSIS modems in them. So even if we want to do an X1-like all-IP user interface, we have a substantial base of boxes that today have set-top box base guides that can go to a cloud-based guide, even if the MPEG cloud guide didn't work, although we think there's a high probability it will work. With regard to WiFi, we -- I've been a proponent of WiFi for years, have deployed lots of it. We have not done that at Charter because our fundamental issues at Charter were fundamental. They were about taking care of our customers and providing high-quality video products and data products and voice products. Those products have been stood up and we have a strategy employed to deploy those products across our footprint. And we're confident that with high-quality products, we'll be able to grow our business. WiFi is an addition to that, and we think that WiFi makes sense. We want to start putting it out in our commercial customer base next year and begin to offer our customers an opportunity to use dual SSIDs in commercial applications. And so while we don't have a complete rollout plan yet, we're working on beginning to deploy WiFi at Charter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Tom, back in your prior management role at that other firm, my impression was always that you were sort of lukewarm on the topic of usage-based pricing for broadband. John Malone at Liberty has spoken strongly in favor of it. Could you just update us on what your current views are? And if you were to get bigger in the industry through consolidation, would that give you a venue for advancing a different view on usage-based pricing in the way broadband is priced?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, my view has been that if you were to -- if broadband were the primary deliver -- service delivery platform for video as opposed to the current model, that those people who watch a lot of videos should pay more than those people who don't. That said -- so I agree with John Malone that the customer who's subscribing to service levels needs to compensate for the service level they've subscribed to. I'm lukewarm to the idea of having ratable billing in the sense that my experience with AOL, which is another prior company, was that AOL's enormous breakthrough in terms of valuation and consumer experience was going from usage-based pricing to all you can eat. And I think that there is a usage issue with the way you bill. And I think finding the right mix of making consumers pay for what they use and having billing that's consistent and regular and predictable for the customer are both important notions to hold at the same time. So I think you have to hold both thoughts in your head at the same time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Want to follow up on 2 of the prior questions. Tom, you talked a bit about drivers of upside to margins longer term. Can you just give us a sense of how much margin upside there might be longer term?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I think if you look at the cable industry and if you look at the various margins between the various companies, I think there's a substantial gap. And so I think that gap can be closed. And obviously, it's a function of mix and product mix and what the margin overall is. I mean, obviously, I think it's more important to drive for return on investment and growth as opposed to margin, but I think that Charter's margin can be significantly higher than it is. I think that Cablevision, in my experience, ran at 40% margins. Comcast runs at plus 40% margins. I think that's a reasonable kind of margin to shoot for in today's product mix. But it can change through time.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then the other question I wanted to follow up was around CapEx with all-digital CapEx being larger in 2014. Does that suggest that CapEx will be similar or higher in 2014 versus '13?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we haven't -- we're not ready to say yet, but we will spend more on CPE in '14 than we did in '13. There are other factors that are going the other way, for instance, commercial but we left cellular tower deployment. And so we don't have our '14 plan completely baked yet, so I don't want to give you that information yet.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And the last follow-up was on the cell deployment, CapEx coming down a little bit. Does that suggest any change in the growth curve for SMB? Or do you think 20%-ish is still a good place to think about as you look forward?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I think our growth curve is not changing, and it's just a mix of products. I think small business, real small business, coaxially served small business continues to accelerate. And in the tower service business, we have additional tenant opportunities, and we have speed opportunities. So I think our business there is not changing in terms of its revenue growth profile and maybe it's becoming less capital intensive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, I wanted to ask you about, if you look back over the last couple of years and this precedes your time at Charter, the company has added a lot of non-video customers, I think about 0.5 million in the last 11 quarters up to about 1\/4 of your customer base. And obviously, those are very -- those are probably all or mostly broadband-only customers, high-return customers. But what do you think those customers are doing with video? Do you think the pay TV penetration in that base is declining? Or do you think those are mostly satellite TV customers still? And are there any implications for Charter as you think about that piece of your business, which is large, growing, highly profitable but maybe not necessarily exactly what you're targeting with your triple-play promotion activity?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. I would say that the one thing that surprised me -- has surprised me about Charter is that our broadband-only growth has been greater than I thought it would be. And part of that, I think, is some change in the world that is going on with consumers. But the bigger part of it is that Charter's video product was inferior, and we had brand issues around that. And so I think while you can see some of these trends occurring throughout the whole industry, it's more exaggerated at Charter, I think, because of the way we let our video product deteriorate, and we've turned that around. And I see the 1.3 million broadband-only customers as a real selling opportunity for us from a video perspective. And obviously, we have to have a better video product. Part of our capital deployment is to do that and to rebuild the service infrastructure. And I think you'll see us start to rebuild our brand as well and take a more aggressive position with our brand. One of the things we found is that our customer perception has come up from the worst in the industry to above average. I think we need to be more than above average. Our new customers have very high opinions of their service levels with us. So the time has come, I think, for us to begin to rebrand Charter and to go forward with a more aggressive push into the marketplace with our video product and our triple-play. But it has what -- the broadband-only base has been a surprise, to some extent, but I also see it as an opportunity.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if I could just follow up on an unrelated topic for Chris. Thank you again for the tax slide that you give us. I'm just comparing it to the year-end '12 one prior to the shift. A lot of moving pieces, but generally speaking, Chris, would it be fair to say that you start to see significant access to carryforwards both at the end of this year with $1.1 billion, but then starting in 2014 in size with the additional $4.4 billion? And is this shift somewhat of a proxy if you had a second shift? So for those of us trying to think what would happen if there was another shift in the next, I don't know, 12 months, can we use what happened here as a way to think about what might happen in the second shift?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So thanks for recognizing the slide, that's one of our favorite ones. And the answer is yes, we've updated these for 2 things: one is the 382 shift that you talked about, ownership shifts that's taken place with Liberty; and the other one is the tax basis that relates to the Bresnan acquisition. The thing that I would highlight about the tax basis first is that's the one that receives the least amount of attention. The NOL receives a lot of attention. I think it's fairly well understood. But if you compare our tax basis relative to our peers or industry norms, I think you'd see that about half of it is excess tax basis and you really need to think about that excess tax basis in a similar vein as the NOLs. So before you start talking about usability of the loss carryforwards, which we scheduled out on that Page 11, we need to think about that tax basis and how that translates -- that tax basis translates into excess depreciation and amortization such that you don't need to access your NOLs as quickly, which means that it's effectively NOL that acts as tax basis. So then on your other question, as it's related to the schedule of the NOLs themselves, even without the benefit of that excess tax basis amortization, yes, I think if you have a subsequent third ownership shift, depending on the timing of when that were to take place, the schedule would look somewhat similar to that as we stand today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to touch on another theme out of the Analyst Day when you spoke, Tom, at Liberty about lowering number of transactions. Kind of walk us through that process and where are you on that voyage trying to lower the transaction volume, where do you think it should be. And then on the interactive guide, would you consider licensing something like X1 from Comcast? I mean, everyone seems to want to reinvent the wheel and do it themselves, but if someone's already developed a platform, is that something you would consider? And why or why not?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Right. Well, when I was talking about lowering transactions, ultimately, lowering transactions is the greatest cost opportunity you have in this business. And the way you lower transactions is to, one, have less service calls. So you maintain design and service your plant in such a way that it doesn't break down as often, and therefore, you have less call. Another way you do it is by managing your product and pricing so that you have as many transactions or as many units per transaction as you can so that you have less physical activity in the sales process. And finally, what you want to do, if you do all of that well and have really good products, is extend your subscriber life. And if your average subscriber life goes up, it means that per dollar of revenue generated by 2 similar cable systems with different subscriber lives average, you end up with lower cost in the longer-lived cable system. So the ultimate objective in lowering transaction costs is to -- is the inverse of great service. And if you have great service, good products, you have less transactions and lower costs and higher margins. With regard to the guide, yes, we'd be interested in licensing it and we currently license IP from other companies for guides, and Comcast has built a very nice application. I do think that guides are ultimately an aesthetic kind of question, meaning the platform is one thing, how they look and how they feel is another. And I think that as we move through time, consumers' experiences will change on average and what their expectations are will change. And it's nice to have that in your own control rather than dealing with third parties. So there's value to licensing someone else's work, and particularly if you can change it at will. So we don't have those discussions with Comcast, but it certainly built a nice piece of art, and we certainly respect it and we respect them, and who knows what could happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Chris, if you were to merge with a larger operator, a question on the tax assets, is it fair to assume that you'd be able to structure a transaction that would result in the net income of the new assets being sheltered by the basis step-up in the NOLs similar to the way Charter's net income is sheltered today? Or would the new asset be treated differently? And then also, you mentioned your leverage target is somewhat driven by Charter's tax position and the future growth rate. In an M&A scenario, the tax benefits are probably not going to be as large relative to the asset base being acquired and the debt, and the growth outlook might also be lower structurally. So does this mean that the leverage ratio would be lower for hypothetical pro forma merged company?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So we're not going to get into anything specific as it relates to M&A today. But as I said before, we have tax assets that are significant, both on the tax asset basis as well as the loss carryforwards, and that puts Charter in a pretty unique position to look at acquisitions, swaps and theory dispositions, and it can be a value-creative element of an M&A strategy. It's not the reason to do M&A, and Tom and I both have spoken extensively about that. The reason to do M&A is because you think you can grow things faster and make money that way. Tax is a little bit like cost synergies. It's a onetime benefit. It's a way of buying down your multiple. But yes, I think -- we think about all different M&A alternatives and ways to use our tax assets. Beyond that, I'd really not -- I'd rather not get into specifics around ways that it can be done in different -- a whole variety of different transactions. On the leverage ratio, remember what I said, is that we look at a whole variety of factors and it can change in the course of time based on where you are from a cost of capital perspective. That's kind of the most simplistic way of looking at it. But the other big factor is what you think your growth profile is. And if you're -- as a business, with or without M&A, you have strong belief that you're going to be mechanically deleveraged and you can either be at a higher steady-state of leverage or temporarily take on lower leverage as a result of strategic opportunities and have confidence in doing so. It only works in the context of having a lower -- a low interest cost, which we have 5.6% interest expense today, and it only works when you have a long maturity, which we have today as well. So when you put all those different pieces together, it says that you can either -- you can temporarily increase your leverage to take advantage of strategic opportunities and you can have more confidence in staying at a higher leverage ratio, which, for us, is that 4 to 4.5x range steady state because of the organic growth profile of the business. If you didn't have confidence in the growth profile of the business, then we would start to modify that and bring it down over time to reflect a risk inherent with the expected cash flows. But where we stand today, we're very comfortable with the target leverage range that we have for Charter today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","First, Chris, can you talk about how your channel mix has evolved in the past year since you launched a new initiative and how we expect that to impact marketing expenses going forward?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So we have significantly changed all of our sales channels the way we go to market. Each of those has different levels of cost. The reality is that there are a variety of different ones you have online, which is now roughly 30% of our total sales are coming through online that's relatively cheap, and we have other channels which are also increasing -- or increasing across all sales channels, some of those are more expensive. So the sales channel mix isn't going to be the biggest driver. The biggest driver is going to be the amount of sales and we're increasing sales and we're increasing our marketing and sales cost, and that's all a good thing. You can see that. When you take a look at the Q3-on-Q3, the uptick there as it relates really to success, which, when you think about margin as in any cable business, you need think about the growth-adjusted EBITDA and the growth-adjusted CapEx and what's really happening to the underlying performance of the cash flows. When we grow, we have the lower margin and we spend more CapEx. When we get to a plateau, the margins rise and the CapEx comes down. And you don't see that take place through marketing the expense line, and we hope to be spending more in that expense line as that would indicate better success.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","That's helpful. And for Tom, regarding the TV app, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you've taken the view that this is primarily a defensive weapon. So I'd be curious to know your content plans for that offering, particularly in the out-of-home side and what you view as the gating factors to perhaps launch in a more robust offering that could allow you perhaps to monetize that app and have it -- have a much more profound impact on your operations.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. Well, the TV app is the beginning of a lot of things, and it may ultimately be monetizable in ways that are different than we currently envision it. What it really is, is it's an IPTV cable TV system that's available in the home and controls your screens in the home initially. In addition to it, it's all the mobile rights that TV Everywhere gives you, and those rights are variable between programming vendors and have different natures to them in terms of what content is available for how long, whether it's a streaming or whether it's on demand. But essentially, it's the creation of a singular unit task network that allows you to stream to any kind of device any place, any time. And the only thing that constrains it from a technical perspective is the contracts that you enter into with content providers. There is no -- there are no technical constraints to where the signals can go. So as our content rights evolve through time, we may find different ways of pricing and packaging content. We may sell download-to-go services. We may sell Video On Demand everywhere. We may sell subscriptions everywhere. But right now, our primary business and our primary objective is to enhance our service offering and to make the total value of what we sell more valuable to the consumer. And ultimately, that gives us more satisfaction, which translates into longer subscriber life, which translates into margins and money.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay, and that's very helpful. And lastly, on the all-digital, as you get closer to completion, as you indicated, can you perhaps talk about how you expect that to affect your data tiering strategy and the potential impact on your standard and premium products, if you have any plans there? And I guess, do you think that gets you closer to the usage-based pricing strategy? Any comments there would be helpful.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Sure. Well, the biggest thing that going all digital will help us do is clear out our cable system in terms of spectrum, and we'll be able to use that spectrum a lot more efficiently in an all-digital environment. And the biggest singular opportunity that, that presents immediately is to take our speeds up on our data product. Right now, we have a DOCSIS 3.0 platform primarily deployed across our footprint and almost 70% of our customers are in that kind of infrastructure today. As a result of that, we can add more channels to that platform and ultimately up to 24 channels, which gives you a capacity of about 500 megabits of capability on the existing design. We have a new platform coming down the road called 3.1. It should be available to the marketplace by the end of '16, and that will allow us to go up as far as 10 gigabits of capacity through our network for data speeds. So we have enormous power at our disposal coming down the pipe in terms of what freed-up networks allow you to do. And the all-digital strategy really kills 2 birds with 1 stone. It gets you a better video product, a more reliable video product and it gets you capacity to take your data speeds up dramatically.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue.","Christopher L.

The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q.

Unless otherwise specified, 2014 growth rates referred to on this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Rutledge","Thanks Stefan. Our strategy to deliver superior products at attractive prices continues to resonate with consumers. Charter\u2019s Spectrum products are now in over 85% of our customers\u2019 households. The continued strength in our customer relationship revenue and cash flow growth reflects the success of our product. And our service metrics, customer satisfaction and churn rates are all improving.","And we will launch new products that leverage the superiority of our network and that will translate into more revenue and even up our home passed. Charter remains in an excellent position to grow its business organically, by additional market share gains, with or without M&A.","During the first quarter, we added 86,000 new residential customer relationships, and over the last 12 months, we've grown our residential customer base by 4.5%. Residential PSUs grew by 160,000 during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've grown expanded basic video relationships and we still expect to add video relationships for the full-year.","In the first quarter, we lost 7,000 video customers, and we added 125,000 broadband customers. Our broadband penetration is now at over 40% of homes passed, and today at about 85% of our residential internet customers subscribe to tiers that provide 60 megabits or more.","During the first quarter, revenue grew by 7.3%. Excluding advertising revenue, total revenue grew by 7.6%, faster than last year's first quarter. Residential revenue growth also improved year-over-year, growing 6.7%. And we\u2019re going faster, with less reliance on annual price reasons. And adjusted EBITDA grew by 7% when excluding Comcast transaction transition expenses.","Our first quarter results continue to demonstrate the sustainable growth profile of our operating strategy. It also demonstrates Charter\u2019s cash flow potential with all-digital behind us, excluding transaction-related expenses. EBITDA less capital expenditures increased by more than $250 million versus last year's first quarter.","Looking specifically at video, during the first quarter we made a few operational changes, including a tightened credit policy. And we didn't have the prior year benefit of all-digital, which drove bulk upgrades and a reduction in unauthorized customers last year. In the coming months, we'll be launching our new cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide, in markets like Reno and St. Louis. Spectrum Guide works on nearly all of our boxes and makes content search and discovery easier and fully enables our on-demand offering.","Results in the test market have been positive. Over the coming months, we'll increase the number of on-demand titles we have on our set-top boxes and on the Charter TV app by a fact of three. The coming months will also see the wider rollout of our Worldbox, our new more advanced and less expensive downloadable security infrastructure in several markets. So our video product, which is fully competitive today, continues to improve. And with Spectrum Guide and other features, it will get even better throughout the year, offering a rich, fully-featured video package that is superior to the competition at a highly attractive price.","We believe that most consumers want fully-featured video products. Those fully-featured video products are at the heart of our video business today, and we believe they\u2019ll be at the core of our video business well into the future. And we expect growth in video in 2015, despite the continued pressure on pay-TV customer growth. That pressure is coming from weak household formation, higher content costs and other entertainment diversions.","Given all the reporting on a possible \u00e0 la carte services and smaller package offering, we've been considering ways to provide compelling services and packages at lower retail price points, with a lower content cost structure, and with the inclusion of direct-to-consumer services, all then offering to satisfy the un-served marketplace.","If we can create a new video product that offers real value to this segment we target and the customers will stick with, that also gives us an opportunity to upgrade customers to our fully-featured video product, this consumer needs change. And obviously we'll do it if we can. We haven't found that product mix yet and we don't think anyone else has either. Therefore we remain focused on the opportunity to provide high-quality television service with a modern user interface to all our passings and grow our video business further.","Turning to commercial. In early March, we reorganized and the re-branded our commercial services under the Spectrum brand and launched a new pricing and packaging structure for the small and medium business segments. That structure is intended to provide better products and greater value to small and medium business customers and to drive deeper product penetration at the point of connect with manageable price step-ups over time, very similar to what we've done in the residential marketplace. We\u2019re already selling more and we expect this new pricing and packaging to reaccelerate the financial growth of our commercial services unit as it has our residential business. The entire business telecom market footprint remains a very significant growth opportunity for Charter.","I'd like to make a few comments on our recently terminated transaction with Comcast. As a company, we put a significant amount of time and effort and money into completing our transaction with Comcast. Obviously, we\u2019re disappointed that our transactions did not close, but I'm pleased that we continue to grow our core business and we've put ourselves in a better position to acquire the $6.5 million un-served passings in our footprint and to acquire other passings in a disciplined manner, consistent with our goal of delivering competitive products and high-quality service at attractive price points to drive market share, cash flow and shareholder value.","Our agreement with Advance\/Newhouse requires that we negotiate in good faith on the termination with Comcast transactions and we're doing that. There isn't more that I'll say beyond that, except I want to compliment the quality of the Bright House assets and the management team, as we already have.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 3 of today's presentation, as Tom mentioned, we grew residential PSUs by 160,000 during the quarter. In the video, we lost 7,000 residential customers compared to 2,000 non-bulk video customer net-adds in the prior period. This slight decline was related to the factors Tom described and has not dampened our full-year outlook for video.","In residential internet, we added 125,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 42,000. Over the last year, our residential customer base grew by 254,000 or 4.5% for the last year. And at the same time, first quarter residential ARPU rose by 1.8% year-over-year driven by sell-in, step-ups and a lower level of annual rate increases for the reasons I mentioned on the last quarterly call.","Despite good triple-play selling, we continued to have a fair amount of single-play internet which pulls on the average ARPU. Despite five shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 6.7% compared to 6.5% one year ago, again with lower rate increases this year.","Looking at commercial, we added 21,000 PSUs. Commercial revenue grew by approximately 15%, driven primarily by small and medium businesses. Excluding the lower growth hospitality video business, telecom revenue grew by 17%.","As Tom mentioned, we recently re-branded our commercial services unit to Spectrum some associated cost in the quarter and we launched new pricing and packaging to the small and medium business segment. We\u2019re already seeing a significant sales uplift at the new price points.","Our advertising revenue declined by about 2% year-over-year, and in total, revenue was up by 7.3% in the first quarter. And excluding advertising revenue, total revenue grew by 7.6%.","Turning to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 6. Total operating expenses grew by $127 million or 8.9% year-over-year. And transition costs related to our transactions with Comcast accounted for about $21 million of that $127 million. Excluding transition cost, total expenses grew 7.4% year-on-year, with total programming expense growing by $60 million and that accounted for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 10% increase in programming is driven by contractual rate increases, about 1% growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year and higher penetration of our tiers, broader carriage in the launch of new channels.","Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operations cost, grew by 5% year-over-year, driven by similar and larger cost of customer base. Other costs grew by $23 million or 12.6% year-over-year, driven by higher labor cost to support commercial, some additional administrative labor expense and an increased bad debt. Excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by $54 million in the quarter or 7% year-over-year with a lower level of rate increases. So our first quarter operating results were solid, generally as we expected.","Moving to Slide 8. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $351 million or 15% of revenue, including $14 million, which was related to Comcast transactions. Much of the transition capital we\u2019ve spent won't in fact be lost, as we needed to accelerate the platform investments that would have incurred over the next couple of years anyway. Either way, the significant year-over-year decline in CapEx was driven by the completion of all-digital during the fourth quarter of last year and we continue to expect approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures in 2015, excluding spending related to acquisitions.","If you just look at EBITDA in CapEx, excluding transition expenses, the increased contribution to cash flow was $256 million in the quarter. That said, we generated $101 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, compared to $74 million last year. Our free cash flow, as I mentioned, was offset by $35 million of transition expenses in CapEx I mentioned a moment ago, M&A expenses which are included below adjusted EBITDA and other expenses, and $36 million of cash interest paid during the quarter for the $7 billion of escorted Comcast transaction debt.","But the biggest driver was first quarter trade working capital, as we saw a significant decline in accruals and payables for CapEx year-over-year, which was a one-time reversal for the all-digital build. So absent that roughly $80 million impact in the quarter, which was $150 million year-over-year working capital swing, our business trend should provide us with a slight working capital benefit on a 12-month rolling basis going forward, as they normally do, with a lot of seasonality in the quarters between.","Turning to our balance sheet. Our current leverage ratio was 4.4x on an LTM basis, within our target leverage range. And including the impact of our recent debt refinancings, our current weighted average volume cost is now 5.2%. I won't go through all of our tax assets again, but we believe we've constructed an very attractive capital structure profile that supports our operating strategy.","And with that, operator we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. The first question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Bazinet","Thanks. I just had two quick questions. In your prepared remarks, Mr. Rutledge, you talked about direct-to-consumer offerings that you were explaining. I just never heard that phrase. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on what that is? And then second on the CapEx front. I'm just - can you just provide may be a little bit of color in terms of why the $1.7 billion is still the correct number for the full-year, given the sharp drop-off in the first quarter? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","All right, Jason. Well, the direct-to-consumer notion in my script was really about a provider of over-the-top services like Netflix, or now in the case of HBO or Hulu or others like that, where the payer of the content has a direct relationship with the customer. And so what I was saying was that our view is that we can mix those products into products that we sell to satisfy the entire customers\u2019 video needs.","Jason Bazinet","And does that - when you say direct-to-consumer, does that imply outside your footprint as well, or you're envisioning DTC within your footprint?","Tom Rutledge","I can't hear him.","Jason Bazinet","Are you talking about - yes, go ahead.","Chris Winfrey","The question was whether direct-to-consumer implies inside of our print or outside of our footprint?","Tom Rutledge","No, I'm assuming that products can be built which would be sold by us inside our footprint, but would also contain products that are sold outside our footprint, delivered by the internet.","Jason Bazinet","Understood, okay.","Tom Rutledge","Generally, but not necessarily.","Jason Bazinet","Understood.","Chris Winfrey","And Jason on CapEx, the $1.7 billion Q1 in cable tends to be a little bit light and seasonal. That's no different here. We also benefited inside of Q1 coming off of all-digital with higher inventory levels. But we think the $1.7 billion is still a fair estimate for the full-year. And when you take a look around, Q1 always tends to be a little bit light than usual.","Jason Bazinet","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik","Thanks. Maybe, we could just explore the video subscriber trends a little bit here in the first quarter. It sounds like churn is coming down, so if you guys were little lighted [ph] on the new connects. And you mentioned a couple of things, but if you could maybe sort of give us an indication of, sort of, the weightings of each, but you said tighter credit standards may be incremental competition from non-traditional guys because with the all-digital transition, and I would say less competition with AT&T, are we expected somewhat higher numbers? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","So John, it's Tom. I think there are several factors when you got to understand where we were and what our planning was. We were getting ready for a big integration. We also had come off the all-digital project, which has - while it has benefits to consumers and even benefits to us in prior quarters, like for instance, unauthorized customers get cut-off when you digitize and they become your customers in many case, although their churn rates grades are higher than the average customer base.","At the same time, the all-digital project is very disruptive. We had to put out six million boxes in a year versus 10 million televisions in a single one-year period. And that's actually - well, it ultimately benefits the consumer to have that, all-digital product, because it frees up our network to increase the data speeds and it frees up our network to put on more HD channels. The whole process is quite disruptive from a consumer perspective and it creates a lot of service transaction.","So we\u2019re slowing down the business in the first quarter to manage our service cost. And they you have dropped off, as we expected they would. So we actually had a fairly modest video budget because of all of that activity anyway.","And finally, I guess when you think about our incentives as a company, our biggest opportunity was the transaction that was in front of us. We were about to divest 40% of our business. And so, our focus was somewhat distracted. But all in all, the operational issues of changing - credit policies changing year-over-year, outcomes as a result of the termination of the all-digital project and the management of the service issues around the all-digital project, we\u2019re comfortable with where we are, and we are comfortable with our growth prospects for the year, which is why we\u2019re saying we plan to go video throughout the year.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks, Tom. It makes sense.","Operator","The next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. Chris, can you - will you give us the - quantify the level of rate increase now that the first quarter is behind you, so we can speak about it versus prior year? I know it was lower. But if you could put any numbers around it, that would be very helpful. And then just, Tom, could you talk about the set-top platform today and where it\u2019s going? So Worldbox, I imagine it's less expensive than what you've been deploying. Can you give us a sense for maybe how much and what else it might do for you? And then on that Netflix OTT integration idea you brought up, how many of your set-tops today could you deploy a product like that in terms of integrating those services into your core video platform?","Chris Winfrey","So on rates, it's a little more complicated because you don't have - it's just not a Q1. In both years, you had different timing season inside the month. What we did this year was extremely - it\u2019s very minimal. But we also benefit from the retrans pass-through that came through inside of Q4. And so you have to look to those two effects cumulatively. One is what was in place in Q4, and therefore the run rate already in January of this year plus the very minimal increases around the edges that we took this year, as compared to the timing of when larger rate increases, not only just for Q1 but cumulative margin rate increases took place last year.","The net effect of all of which is the cumulative Q4 and Q1 increases that we took this year were substantially lower on a percentage and dollar revenue basis than what we had done last year. And without getting in total, the complexities - I think the easier way to take a look at it is, if you look at the quarterly - quarter-over-quarter residential customer ARPU growth, this quarter we are at 1.8% more of a stepping out that we have lot less annual rate increases and if look at Q4 of last year, it was up at 3.1%. We really did go out of our way last quarter to explain that to people as what the Q4 impact was and how we were intentionally not going to take the same level of rate increases this year for the reasons we mentioned last quarter, some of which Tom just touched on, frankly.","So it's a roundabout way of saying it's a large difference when you take the cumulative Q4 and Q1, and largely lower than what we did last year.","Tom Rutledge","So then your question on the set-top type on Worldbox and price and integration of other products into our product offering. There are really two platforms that we are currently rolling out that increase and change the nature of our video product dramatically. One is our new cloud-based user interface, our Spectrum Guide. And that's are backward compatible user interface that state-of-the-art and looks like any kind of guy that can be rendered on any kind of device today, it is completely modern and useful and can be changed with very little development time because all of the activity is done centrally in a server-based architecture.","The breakthrough that we've achieved in our strategy is that this cloud-based user interface also speaks multiple languages of digital. So it can talk to DOCSIS boxes. It can talk to any device, both in the home or outside the home. And it can talk to historically placed digital boxes in the language of MPEG as opposed to IP, which can be either cable or internet language.","And so we can render this user interface on every set-top box that's been historically deployed. So as I said earlier, we now have 10 million deployed set-top boxes, many of them which can\u2019t receive DOCSIS signals, many of which can. And we\u2019re going to deliver this new user interface in both DOCSIS and in MPEG. We\u2019re using the active video platform and other software platforms that we have. And we\u2019re also going to leave a small resident guide on the set-top boxes, so that if the boxes ever lose connectivity to the server, that customer still has user interface.","Our view is that, that won't be needed, but we\u2019ve built belt-and-suspenders around it. On that platform, because it's streamed, we can put any other services as well onto very television or outlet we have. Those can be services that we sell directly. They can be services that other companies sell directly. And we can include those in the UI if we want to or not. So it's a open architecture that gives us a tremendous capability depending on which way the television marketplace evolves.","Worldbox is a better set-top box and it uses a downloadable security that is under our control as opposed to the box vendor\u2019s control. And it allows us therefore to buy boxes from any vendor anywhere and the reason we call it a Worldbox, it just means we can buy from any world vendor. And we don't have a particular vendor in mind when we think about Worldbox, although we've done deals with Cisco and ARRIS and others to build these boxes and deploy these boxes.","It's primarily - it's a very sophisticated box, but it\u2019s inexpensive because, one, the conditional access isn't part of the box price. And two, we\u2019re sort of writing Moore\u2019s Law. And three, we\u2019re getting the effect of having a competitive world marketplace in front of us and people offering their product at competitive prices to us.","Interestingly, the all-digital project that we just did was positively impacted by the fact that we built Worldbox. Our traditional box vendors became very accommodating to us and developed Worldbox with us, so all the writing on the wall and proceeded to go where technology takes them. And we actually got very good pricing on the traditional boxes that we deployed and we also worked with the FCC and got waiver, so that we could put out boxes that didn't have cable cords, that waiver since been negated by a change in law. But we took advantage of our rollout strategy and our architectural strategy throughout the period. But going forward, we expect CPE to continue to come down, and that ultimately takes capital intensity out of the business.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","The next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with NSR.","Jonathan Chaplin","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to go back to your comments on how you're looking at the video market, and get a sense the opportunity we - one of the opportunities we are excited about at Charter is your ability to take video penetration up fairly significantly from where it is at the moment. Is it your view that the market has changed and you need to come in - you need to put a lower price to offer into the market with the direct-to-consumer products in order to get to penetration levels that we might have thought you could get to before, or is that entirely additive to the original business plan?","Tom Rutledge","Well, I'd say this way, the multi-channel video universe is very highly penetrated. And there is a slight loss of video penetration in aggregate. That said, there is a tremendous opportunity for us to shift share to us to our better platform. So we see lots of video growth in front of us in a market that is mature but not shrinking dramatically.","So the whole over-the-top issue or cord-cutting I guess is a better way of describing it, issue, is the fact - it is occurring and its occurring for a variety of reasons that I stated earlier, household formation, income levels, particularly the price of the full package is expensive. And we do have the internet now and people are using the internet for both, video entertainment but other kinds of diversionary entertainment, all of which have - which you see affecting the ratings of video product in a negative way, but which puts more pressure on the price side of the video product from a licensing perspective.","All of those factors are real, but it's also reality that people do like the full service and people want the full service. It's just that it\u2019s not that inexpensive. And so we see growth. We\u2019d love to be able to serve people with products that are less than a full package, if their income or light viewer limited in terms of their desire for that product. I mean the elasticity of demand for the product changes by what the alternatives are.","And frankly, if you sell people products that they think are cable or the full product and they are not that product, the churn rates go very high. And Philippe Dauman yesterday said something about family packages in the video space, which I think is right. People have played around with packaging in the past. And the reality is that most people want the whole thing, even though that it's true that they don't watch that many channels, they have access to a lot of servers, and the quality is quite good.","So when you think about packaging and targeting people, it's not that easy to find niches, and it's not that easy to make the model work without a full service package of product. That said, we are looking at all the alternatives. We see what's going on in the marketplace. We see the maturity of the marketplace. But fundamentally, our growth strategy is driven by high-quality full-service products.","Jonathan Chaplin","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Tom just continuing on your prior comments, obviously FiOS is trying to take creative view on how they can do this. Do you believe that that kind of structure of a consumer proposition is what the market needs and one can you do that? And then for Chris, just of quickly, just the pulse of the higher market today. Is there obviously been borrowing money over the last few months as part of the Comcast transaction, but to get tens of billions of dollars of financing. Is the market fully available, the big banks, will it provide bridge loans broadly speaking. So just want to see if you can give us some sense of how the spread market is? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","With regard to FiOS package. I think those kinds of products have been tried in the past. And I don't know what\u2019s in FiOS\u2019s contracts with ESPN, but generally there are tiering requirements and there are penetration requirements for service levels that are quite - they have been historic in the industry. Because people have tried these tiers previously, family packages. In fact at one point, the FCC was promoting that idea with the family tier in their last administration.","So it is it's not a new concept. Products have been launched even decades ago. HBO light festival and other services like that, they were designed to appeal to niches. But all of them have ended up migrating back into a full package kind of world. And so it's hard to actually given the way that business is structured when you are buying programming to build products that actually satisfy people and - but would I be rather be able to sell lots of smaller tiers? Yes, I would. But I still think the majority of households would buy most of them.","Chris Winfrey","And Vijay on the capital markets question, there is some of that that\u2019s in embedded M&A question that I'd like to steer away little bit. But generally I'd say, it feels to us that the capital markets remains healthy and receptive for good credits and for good operating strategies. And that's what is on our hands is to have a good operating strategy. And beyond that, it\u2019s difficult to say.","Vijay Jayant","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett","Hi, thank you. So I want to return to the trajectory of ARPU for a second, separate and apart from the mix of single-plays and triple-plays which sort of clouds it. Can you just give us a little bit of insight into how you're tracking with respect to the step-ups in pricing, and is that flowing through at the rate that you had come to expect it? And if you could just an update us on how much of that is still to come as we look forward?","Chris Winfrey","Craig, yes, it is as we expected and our model is working. I think the mix is slightly different than I might have talked a couple of years ago in terms of triple-play to single data play and that kind of thing. But it is essentially - those people that price into packages are stepping up as we expected and the retention rates are what we\u2019ve forecasted and planned all along. And so the trajectory of the ARPU is consistent with our model.","Tom Rutledge","And Craig, I'd add onto that. It\u2019s a healthy development. So it's an ARPU development that\u2019s supported by delivering the customer of what they want with the fastest internet speed, the lowest cost voice, the most fully-featured video product at an attractive price, which is what gives you the step-up power to began with, but even more that steps up that\u2019s still at a better price point for all the services with better service than the customer could receive elsewhere, which is really what makes it sustainable, at the same time you're delivering 4.5%, 5% customer growth at the same time.","Craig Moffett","And so how should we think about the growth of ARPU going forward? I know you can't give precise guidance, but can you give us general guidance for how you would expect the ARPU to track over the next year or so?","Chris Winfrey","Sure. I'm not going to give forward guidance, but I think I can direct you to - in our investor presentation that we produce every quarter, you can see the year-over-year growth rates and you can see where point in time where we\u2019ve had some annual rate flowing through and you can see when there is essentially not been that effect flowing through, which is why I was making the healthy ARPU increase is based on the business development.","And you have a lot more transactions that are taking place in VCI [ph]. You don\u2019t only have gross connects. You have migrations. You have upgrades. You have downgrades. And you have bundling of those customers and the pricing of the bundle of those customers that are disconnecting. It's a really complex model.","Tom Rutledge","It is.","Chris Winfrey","And I think it\u2019d be wrong to try to oversimplify it, but when you have an operating strategy that has the product pricing and packaging that we have, you can be in an environment where you have steady price increases that are based on the value that you're providing and you can do it in a way that despite the higher input costs that your overall gross margin and EBITDA margin per customer and your EBITDA margin per passing can increase substantially in some cases, despite the fact that some of your input costs are growing up at a higher rate. And that's what puts cable generally and Charter I think in a unique position relative to others, as long as you provide the right pricing packaging.","Craig Moffett","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. You noted in your comments and in your release that there was an increase in bad debt expense year-over-[year and one of your peers had a similar disclosure. I'm just curious, is that coming from the commercial side or the residential side? And then just as a follow-on, could you talk a little more broadly about what you're seeing in the economy and how it\u2019s affecting your business?","Chris Winfrey","Yes, I don't think it's much from an economic development. I think it ties into what Tom was describing before. It's coming out on the back-end of all-digital. We had some uplift from unauthorized customers becoming paying customers, and sometimes you see some of that coming up at back-end as well. We also did make some changes to both our collection and credit policies that weigh into that that has a one-time effect. So it's a combination of those two factors. I would call it more self-inflicted intentionally for good reasons as opposed to broader macroeconomic or cable industry challenges.","Tom Rutledge","Yes, the broader economic situation is actually slightly improving. There\u2019s more housing construction than there has been. Not much, but more.","Brett Feldman","Great. And just as a follow-up, I mean, should we expect the bad debt expense will improve going forward from this point?","Chris Winfrey","That's our goal.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham research.","James Ratcliffe","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I could. First of all, on the business services side, you talked about free packaging and on that front. How much of an issue you're finding the lack of availability of a bundled wireless product to be, and how much interest are you seeing customers for that? And secondly, just from a staffing perspective. Do you have any replacements or rebuilds needed, particularly the systems you're planning on divesting of folks who decided to depart for that happened? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","So with business packaging, your question was, do we need a wireless component to that product?","James Ratcliffe","Are you seeing any meaningful number of customers who are looking for to roll wireless into it, or are people mainly making those decisions separately?","Tom Rutledge","Well, we currently - our wireless product in the small business space is a Wi-Fi router, where the business and for the public spaces in the business as part of the product mix. And we see that as highly attractive from a product point of view, and we see increased market share shift to us in that area.","With regard to mobile wireless phones, we are not in that business, don't have a product today for small business to do that. And so all of the business that we\u2019re creating is wireline and Wi-Fi. But our fundamental strategy there is to - like it is in the residential space, to stand up a better product than our competitors and to sell it at reasonably attractive promotional pricing and to drive a market share strategy and to - we've reorganized our operations, so that we can actually handle the speed of a higher activity level, which has an effect in our cost structure by the way also, initially.","But we're very pleased with the results we\u2019re getting already and our expectations there are proving out. So we expect to have an accelerating small business growth prospect.","With regard to staffing, Charter maybe got a little ahead of itself in some staffing areas in hiring people as a result of the proposed transaction, probably aren't reflected in all the transaction cost. But in general, because of the way our operations are structured, the divested areas are not - they\u2019re fully staffed and the people who were planning on going to Comcast and working for Comcast, we really haven't lost people in those areas. And they are all - obviously they were confused and their lives were disrupted and all of that, but they\u2019re with us and their prospects with us are bright and he don't have any deficits in terms of our ability to execute in those areas.","James Ratcliffe","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Then next question will be from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank Louthan","Great, thank you. Can you give us an update on your prospects for fiber-to-the-tower and small-cell builds in your territories? Are you seeing any meaningful business there, and what do you think your outlook is for getting those kind of contracts?","Tom Rutledge","Fiber-to-the-tower and small cell.","Chris Winfrey","Yes. Well, cell backhaul prospects.","Tom Rutledge","I'm sorry we\u2019re having hard time hearing you. I am anyway. Our fiber-to-the-tower business is still a good business and it\u2019s still growing. It's not as growing as fast because we've covered a lot of the towers in our footprint. With regard to small-cells, we don't have any small-cell arrangements with anybody and haven't done any. We've looked at that, and we\u2019ve looked at the opportunities with combine licensed and unlicensed spectrum in small-cells, but we don't have any business plans to announce.","Chris Winfrey","Frank, what I would tell you is a lot of the capital has been spent on that. And so we're seeing the benefit of the existing contracts through revenue, which is always by design is capital intensive. We are seeing tenants connect to the existing capital that we\u2019ve deployed which was always our hope and not part of the ROI of business case when we built it. So it's an attractive business.","Frank Louthan","Can you give us an update on maybe how many towers you have wired up or the value of the revenue stream?","Chris Winfrey","I don't have that in front of me. And so I could give you a number, but I want to make sure that if I did run the risk of mixing fiber sites and cell backhaul together, I'd rather not do that and have to correct it afterwards. But it's still growing and it\u2019s growing well but it's not growing at the pace of newbuild that it did probably a year ago.","Tom Rutledge","But upgrades are going faster than the pace they were.","Chris Winfrey","Yes, that's exactly right.","Frank Louthan","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies.","Mike McCormack","Hi guys, thanks. Tom maybe if you can make a quick comment on just the regulatory environment title two and obviously your consolidation was top of mind, but we don't have to get delve too deeply into it. But just your thoughts on what the environment is from regulatory standpoint, whether or not it's sort of friendly to cable or not. It seems sort of not. And then commenting maybe on the voice side with respect to the pricing strategy there and maybe cost per month per sub and how that's trending? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","Okay. Well, look on the regulatory side, I mean I think every situation is different. Title two was a - it's actually a long standing issue. The issue of net neutrality has been around for a long time and companies have been agitating. It\u2019s been part of the President\u2019s agenda all along, and he campaigned on it initially. So it's not surprising that the forces that prevailed there did. Although I wish it were structured differently and I thought that the outcome was less than ideal. I don't think that is particularly related to being friendly or not friendly to cable in general. And I think every company is different. Every transaction is different. And they\u2019re really independent structural questions from a regulatory perspective.","Chris Winfrey","And on voice pricing, it's going down.","Tom Rutledge","Yes, our view in the long run is that it has to go down. We price - our permanent pricing at $19.95 all taxes and fees included. And the cost of providing voice is going down and we're still growing voice fairly nicely, because it's worth at that price today. Will it be five years from now? Probably not. But I think having a fully-featured wireline voice product with high quality service is worth something. And so in the package, I think we'll continue to sell it well.","Mike McCormack","I guess I was just trying to get a sense for how that margin trends over time and does it approach sub-overall business type margin?","Chris Winfrey","Yes, the issue that you have seen in our P&L that voice revenues have been coming down, a lot of that\u2019s just allocation in the bundles that we knew from new pricing and packaging despite the fact that we've been growing up. So instead of selling it at $40, it's been priced in on the rack rate of $20. So that's just an allocation issue. But we are in a position now that despite that allocation, you can start to say gross margin despite moving dollars out of that piece of the bundle, gross margin can be increasing. And I believe that started to do so already.","Tom Rutledge","Yes, that's right. Because of the way we transition the pricing, we finally hit the place where we started to grow total revenue.","Chris Winfrey","Yes, I want to be clear that's not how we look at it. And we look at it on per home basis in terms of EBITDA and cash flow that we can get out of their home, because I could price and I'm not saying we\u2019d do this, but you could price and I wouldn't do it anyway big time [ph]. But we could price at zero and you could talk about margin on the product, so you can price it $35. The reality is most people aren\u2019t buying phone on a standalone basis. They are buying it together with their other services. And so what you have to focus is the value that you're providing inside the home, what you should price it at and what's the margin that you have for the whole bundle of service.","Mike McCormack","Sure, understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","And the final question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks. Chris you mentioned, I think, previously that when your new programming contracts came up, you're going to negotiate as a larger company. And I guess with the transactions now being called off, does anything change with upcoming programming negotiations?","Tom Rutledge","I\u2019ll answer that, probably. But I don't think that the arc of our programming expense will change significantly as a result of this. I think there are synergies that occur in transactions that come from scale or existing contracts attributing to another company. But in terms of Charter as a standalone business, I don't think it materially affects what our costs will be, relative to what they were historically.","Chris Winfrey","The only thing I\u2019d add to that just purely from a financial perspective what we knew was there, and we knew we would get it. We never put it inside of any of our plans because you didn\u2019t forecast exactly where and when it would come from. So we took the conservative approach and when we put things together for acquisitions that ended up publicly disclosed places but didn\u2019t reflect those type of synergies.","Marci Ryvicker","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.","Tom Rutledge","Thank you."],"4641":["Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  8, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Robin Gutzler - ","Thomas M.

We won't review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect the management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. ","In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma results for 2011. The pro forma results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011, as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011, unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thank you, Robin. In the first quarter, we saw significant improvement in customer trends, and overall results were as planned. First quarter revenue was up nearly 3%, while adjusted EBITDA was down approximately 2% year-over-year. The change in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the costs associated with accelerated customer growth. Free cash flow was $102 million this quarter versus $74 million in Q1 of last year. We gained 274,000 RGUs, more than double the net gain last year. We grew 20,000 video customers for the first quarterly video growth in 5 years. Internet customer additions grew by more than 50% year-over-year. And we added nearly 100,000 new relationships in the quarter, more than triple the gain 1 year ago.","Given the higher level of customer acquisition, we have an excellent opportunity to upgrade the level of service we provide those customers. In evaluating the key levers to drive further growth, my focus in the first 3 months has been on revising our pricing, packaging and selling structure and accelerating our path to an improved product set, particularly our video product.","The goals are to have higher ARPU per connect, lower transaction cost per customer, better retention by improving the value relationship with our customers and increasing operating cash flow across the 12 million homes we pass. Our Internet product is superior across virtually our entire footprint. The company has been smart in using this Internet advantage to gain new customer relationships and will continue to press this competitive advantage. ","In the video, we've improved the quality of the product we offer today, and we will accelerate that. For example, Charter's goal was to have 100 HD channels by the end of this year. Today, we're on a path to reach that by midyear. Above and beyond HD channels, we will also employ a number of tactics to achieve higher digital sell-in in HD\/DVR takeup. We have the necessary products and network capabilities today to create a compelling digital offer for existing customers and successfully compete for new video relationships by having a better video product than our competitors can replicate.","Our voice product will be more fully featured and priced more favorably than our competitors. And our commercial business is rapidly growing with a strong competitive position and a superior product offering. The company is underpenetrated in the marketplace, both in residential and commercial, and has a significant opportunity for growth. We have a powerful network and capabilities, and we are ramping our strategy and accelerating activities, which we believe will deliver results. ","I'll now turn it over to Chris to give more details on the results for the quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Before I begin, I'd like to point out 2 reporting changes we made this past quarter. We moved revenue and customers related to bulk residential agreements from commercial to residential. In addition, we're not including residential customer relationships related to these agreements on an equivalent bulk unit or EBU basis. Both of these changes are reflected in our financial results and trending schedules, including historically, and more details can be found in the footnotes to those schedules.","Turning to Slide 4. First quarter revenue grew 2.8% year-on-year. Residential Internet grew 9%, driven by share gains and growth in home networking, partially offset by the impact of promotional offers. As we discussed in the fourth quarter call, our focus is on driving penetration and using Internet to create customer relationships, increasingly bundled relationships as our video product improves. ","Phone revenue was up 2%, reflecting customer growth and also slightly lower ARPU, consistent with our strategy to use attractively priced offers to drive deeper product penetration in homes we serve. Video revenue was down 3% year-on-year. In video, while we did significantly better with our basic customer base in Q1, we still have a year of net losses that impact the top line. As we start to do better in video, it will take several periods to see the full benefit in revenue. ","In addition, we saw a $12 million decline in premium and VOD over the prior year. We expect to get greater benefit from premium as part of the pricing and packaging strategies Tom discussed. And while free VOD usage is up substantially, pay VOD usage has declined. In addition, Q1 was a poor quarter for events.","As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we continue to offer promotions to -- that drive share gains during the first quarter. We were able to achieve the significant volume growth, with little impact on total ARPU per residential customer relationship, which declined $0.78 from Q4 2011 to Q1, and reflected a higher mix of lower ARPU non-video relationships.","We also rolled through price adjustments towards the end of Q1, which included increases to certain Internet gears and basic and digital video. April will be the first month of those increases -- the first full month of those increases, so these had little impact on Q1, but will have a positive impact on revenue in Q2.","Turning to Slide 6. Commercial business continues to accelerate, incurring revenues over 20% compared to the first quarter of last year. Our cell backhaul pipeline is stronger than ever, but we had few reactivations in Q1, driving less in cell revenue. And ad sales were up 6.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by the accounting change we have discussed in the previous quarters, though we also saw price increases in volume in political and automotive spend.","Moving to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. We saw margin pressure in the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA was down 2% year-on-year. There were 3 big drivers impacting earnings and margin in the quarter. First, our video margin. I already mentioned the revenue pressures for video. Stabilizing or returning the video category to growth would be a significant top line and bottom line driver for us down the road, but our emphasis on growth will likely result in both the OpEx and CPE investment in the near term. ","On the expense side, we recognized programming and retrans cost increases of $22 million. But these were not matched by price adjustments in Q1, and therefore, impact the year-over-year comparison. We expect improvement in Q2 related to the rate adjustments.","The second large driver was the impact on margin from accelerated customer growth. We estimate the higher expense to drive the accelerated growth inside the quarter relative to the same quarter last year as approximately $17 million, driven by marketing, sales and reconnect expenses. We'd like to see more of this and hope it continues. As Tom mentioned, we'll look to further improve the ROI of that spend by including more value into what we sell, resulting in higher revenue per connect and greater customer lifetime value.","And the third main driver of lower EBITDA was our customer experience investment, which totaled approximately $9 million in Q1. This was driven by increased contract labor and higher levels of preventative maintenance. This is likely to continue in the near term, but should pay off in the form of lower churn and better cash flow.","Importantly, in areas outside of customer experience and growth-related cost, we remain disciplined on nonrevenue-generating expenses. For example, first quarter bad debt expense was 12% lower than the prior year, even as we grew sales.","Turning to Slide 8. In CapEx, recall that we estimated 2012 CapEx at $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion on the Q4 call. As we mentioned, this will likely give an update in Q2 as we finalize and implement the strategies Tom highlighted. ","Spending in Q1 totaled $340 million, which was $16 million lower than last year due to timing of our scalable infrastructure spend, which was partially offset by higher CPE spend to fund the customer growth.","As you can see on Slide 9, we had another quarter of positive free cash flow, which was $28 million higher than Q1 of last year driven by working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash interest payments. Since March 31, we continue to refinance our debt obligations to opportunistically improve our maturity profile and to amend certain provisions of the credit agreement to bring them in line with other parts of our capital structure. ","Slide 19 contains our pro forma and maturity profile for all transactions completed since quarter end. We expect our annualized interest expense, pro forma for all refinancing activities to date, to be approximately $860 million. And our leverage was 4.8x at quarter end.","In closing, I'd like to remind everyone about our tax assets highlighted on Slide 10, which are equally important for debt and equity holders. As of 12\/31, we had $9.3 billion of tax basis and $7.4 billion of NOLs, and we don't expect to be a significant taxpayer until after 2017. Simply put, $1 of EBITDA from Charter is not the same as $1 of EBITDA elsewhere, given our NOLs and outsize tax basis. With positive free cash flow, a moderate leverage target and valuable tax assets, we have a unique financial profile to drive Triple Play growth. ","Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first audio question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm wondering if Mr. Rutledge could maybe discuss in a bit greater detail what some of the changes to your pricing and packaging you may be considering. Would you consider ever moving away from the focus on offering, for example, your single-play HSD product, which you have been doing since, I think, the back half of 2010? And then I do have one follow-up question.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, the most significant thing that we're doing from a packaging perspective and from a pricing perspective is improving our video product and adding value to our video product. Charter has a superior network infrastructure, and it hasn't been fully taking advantage of it because of the legacy of its analog subscriber base. And what we're doing is improving the digital product we go to market with in video. So the most significant impact from a consumer perspective will be that when they buy video from Charter going forward, they're going to get a much richer package in terms of the kind of quality of picture they get and the amount of channels they get. And they're going to get offered that in a way that, combined with the data and voice, make to the compelling offer from a competitive point of view. And it'll be a superior product to Satellite, superior product to U-verse. In the video space, it'll be obviously a better data product, already is a better data product than our wireline competitors and the voice product will be more fully featured and less expensive. So combined, it'll be actually sold at a higher ARPU than we currently sell, but the value proposition for the customer will be much greater. We'll be taking advantage of our network assets.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess the follow-up question, I'll just go back to the original question. Would you -- are you still as focused -- do you think, going forward, will you still be as focused on pushing the single-play HSD product that you had priced at about the same price as it was as part of the bundle back at the end of 2010? Or do you think you might steer clear of doing that going forward?","Thomas M. Rutledge","We continue to have great success with our high-speed data product, and we'll continue to support that in the marketplace as a standalone product. But we'll be also enhancing that market posture with additional packages.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of Bishop Cheen with Wells Fargo.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Your leverage continues to improve, although it seems to be at this -- inside 5x. As you look out with all of the other projects you have going on for capital allocation, where do you think you can take your leverage 1 year from now? Or for a little wider look, say, by the beginning of 2014, where would you like to have it as a stable place?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Well, I think absent providing -- this is Chris, absent providing EBITDA guidance, we remain focused on getting into our target leverage range of 4x to 4.5x. Frankly, the timing for us getting there depends on the level of success that we're having in driving some of the initiatives that Tom was describing and the strategic opportunities that present themselves along the way. So in the meantime, our first and largest priority is to protect the long-term EBITDA and cash flow generation capability of the business, and that may mean investing more in OpEx and capital to go drive that kind of grow that puts you in a better, steady-state cash flow position, which ultimately delevers you significantly through -- mechanically through EBITDA growth. So the timing of that depends not only on the long-term success, but also the upfront organic opportunities that present themselves to go invest for growth. So I don't want to provide a guidance as to when we're going to be hitting that. It's the function of the growth opportunities and other strategic opportunities that come, but it's safe to say that we still believe that 4x to 4.5x, plus or minus a half turn periodically to enable strategic opportunities, that 4x to 4.5x is the right place to be for us. I hope that's helpful.","Operator","Your next audio question comes from the line of David Joyce with Miller Tabak.","David Carl Joyce - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment a little more broadly on the strength that we're seeing in the video product. Does it seem like there's more consumers coming back into the pay TV environment, granted you do break out residential and commercial video subs? But the residential was a nice surprise. If there's more color you could provide on that'd be great.","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'm not sure I can tell you what the exact macro trend is, but it's certainly -- there's a couple of favorable wins at our back which are -- certainly, the economy isn't getting worse. I'm not sure it's getting better from a housing perspective, but it's not getting worse. And the amount of telco overbuild, as a percentage of passings [ph] activity has declined year-over-year, and it looks like that's a longer-term trend as well. So that's having a somewhat of a favorable impact on growth opportunities.","David Carl Joyce - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","And where are you generally on the evolution of the TV Everywhere product becoming more available?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Our plan -- we have it in our product roadmap for this year. And our plan is to roll it out or upgrade, I should say, TV Everywhere, but a tablet-based video product, some elements of which will be TV Everywhere, but parts of it will be cable television as well inside the house.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have two. Chris, I wanted to ask you or Tom about the incremental spending in the quarter. I think you said $17 million related to customer growth and it includes marketing?","Christopher L. Winfrey","That's correct.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So, I mean, you look at -- you added 100,000-plus incremental PSUs. You guys talked about the RGU increase. If I strip out the marketing increase, and I'd love for you guys to comment on the marketing spend in the quarter, whether that -- where that was aimed, if that was brand or kind of a more direct marketing or variable with customer growth. I mean you're spending -- you're not spending much money to add a lot of incremental services, so I'm wondering if that's how you guys think about it. The backup marketing was like $5 million increase or $50 a -- incremental PSU, which is a pretty fabulous return. So I'm wondering if you could talk about the marketing spend, how much that was brand versus sort of directly related to customer growth, and then if that's the right way to think about your sort of return on investment on subs going forward. And then just on the pricing increase in April, Chris, would you be willing to comment on EBITDA growing in the second quarter or not at this point? I know you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but obviously, you're investing quite a bit, but you also have some help on the ARPU front 2Q, which you talked about.","Christopher L. Winfrey","So maybe I'll take the second one first, which is we're not going to provide Q2 guidance for revenue or EBITDA. But it's safe to say that given the dynamic of having the bulk of your programming increases flow through in Q1 and at the same time, not taking a rate increase until effectively Q2, it certainly will be beneficial to the top line, much of which or all of which will go to the bottom line, so it should be an improvement relative to Q2. On the second one, as related to...","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, I was going to say we're not going to break out our marketing spend by brand and by acquisition, but marketing costs are a factor, obviously, in growth, but so are transaction costs. Our objective is to create more valuable products that have longer subscriber lives, which means that the ROI or the cash flow per transaction goes up on a lifetime basis. And that's our primary objective. And we already have a good transaction process, meaning that the cost of a transaction for us is positive from an ROI perspective, and that includes the fact cost or the marketing cost, and we think that we can improve it.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And, Tom, do -- you mentioned the video product getting better and talked about high-def and adding more programming. What about the guide? That's been an area where customers, I think, have probably had some negative experiences, and particularly, on some of the legacy boxes. What's the plan for the guide at Charter over time? Are you happy with the product today?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we have an issue with the product and our legacy boxes and how to deal with that. And as part of our -- my prior answer about TV Everywhere, what we're contemplating is putting out IP products in the home and out of the home that give you control over your existing set-top boxes. So the ability to program a DVR to do search and to do other kinds of -- even to change channels have been deployed in other parts of the cable industry as applications on tablets, smartphones and PCs. And I think that, that opportunity allows us to take our legacy boxes and make those legacy boxes work better from a user interface perspective and allow functions like search and discovery to appear on all of our existing set tops. So I'm actually fairly positive on the situation we have in terms of the way that the consumer electronics industry has evolved. It actually creates an opportunity for us to take our existing capital base of deployed boxes and make them really work a lot better without having to replace all those boxes with a new, more powerful box that has a capability of carrying a more robust guide. And I think that has long-run implications for the kind of money that we're going to have to invest in the CPE. I think it means that we can have thinner client CPE going forward, which means that it should cost less on an incremental basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question for Mr. Rutledge. There's a perception in the marketplace, and I don't if you agree with this, that the video product is still very much the anchor product for cable and that once that relationship is lost, it's very difficult to sell in other services. I guess my question is twofold. Do you agree with that as a general premise, or do you see that sort of changing as data becomes more important? And given that, is there -- is it fair to say that your top priority is to sort of get the video customers as a percent of all the passings [ph] up as sort of a prerequisite to drive other products?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I wouldn't say it's a prerequisite. Video is a great business as a standalone business, and it's a very powerful medium and it allows you to advertise effectively and sell other products across your platform. So having -- when you're a multiproduct company, having a video relationship is a real competitive advantage. That said, it doesn't mean that all of the products that the network is capable of providing shouldn't be sold to the market niches that exist. So for instance, commercial is not particularly video-centric in terms of the opportunity and yet, it's a big piece of the business. So at the residential level, we are underpenetrated from a video point of view. It's a good business from a return on investment perspective. It allows you to sell other products, and so I think it's a essential part of our product mix and we ought to take advantage of it, because our network's capable of doing it. But that doesn't mean that in places where video doesn't work as a driver that we shouldn't use other aspects of our network like high-speed data and voice, WiFi to create additional opportunity. So I don't look at it as a prerequisite, but just as a significant opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","First, on the video side, could you talk a little bit about where you are seeing disconnects? How much of that is losing subscribers to Satellite? How much is losing subscribers over the top? How much is just losing households, people moving in with one another and so forth, given the economy?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we actually gained subscribers in the first quarter and...","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Right. But -- on a net basis, but certainly you had disconnects, and if we were to think about those disconnects, just would love to get a little sense of where you think those guys are going.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, essentially, I mean, to speak in generalities, there's very little over-the-top substitution going on, almost -- and the whole multichannel universe is highly competitive. The biggest competitor that Charter has is Satellite, and so a lot of activity is the result of moves and other commercial activity. But in the end, the subscriber base is subscribing to multichannel television generally at very high penetrations. And the biggest competitor we have in the video space is Satellite.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on -- with respect to the programming costs, do you see, when you look out -- I mean, do you see any easing on the horizon, or should we expect kind of continued unit cost increases that we've been seeing over the past several quarters?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I think that the programming cost is a -- there's nothing changing the current trends in programming, except that it's become a very big number. There's some regulatory pressure on programmers, the retrans issue has the potential of creating additional regulatory pressure. And so whether that will cause programmers to moderate their rate of increase, it's hard to say. But right now it's a difficult part of the business to manage from a cost perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry if you said this in prepared remarks, we got dropped off the call for a little bit. But I'm just wondering if you could just update us on where you are with the TiVo rollout. I think that it was originally scheduled for second half and then that was going to be delayed. And then also, I just wanted to see if you could comment on the gross ad versus the churn trends. I know gross ads obviously accelerated with the increase in marketing spend, but I was wondering what you're also seeing on the churn side.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Do you want to talk about churn?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes. So the bulk of our performance inside of Q1 and Q4 really came from improved acquisition. We did see improved retention levels as well, and so year-over-year improvements and we continued to do well as the customer experience investment has taken hold. But the bulk of the net gains improvement still remains from an acquisition side.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. And we continue to work integrating the TiVo product. We have a complicated VOD infrastructure, and we're continuing to work on getting that product developed.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you have any kind of update on the time frame for the commercial rollout or...","Thomas M. Rutledge","We do have some customers in place in Texas, but we haven't announced the general rollout as of yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","So as I look at the penetration for Charter, one of the things that strikes me that you guys have the -- among the highest digital penetration in the industry, and yet that seems to not translate into some of the other potential drivers that some of your peers have been able to leverage. So, Tom, speaking to perhaps your experience at Cablevision, what is it that strikes you here as the potential anomaly in terms of actually leveraging this very high digital penetration? And how should we think about that going forward? The video penetration overall is still far below the industry average and yet the digital is very high, and it seems to me, as you alluded to, that the plant is as good as anyone else's. So any thoughts on that -- addressing that would be helpful.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Sure. Just because you have a high penetration of digital boxes doesn't mean your entire product is in digital. And what we are doing is removing analog signals and increasing the amount of total digital signals in the product mix, so that all incremental customers going forward are 100% digital. And that's different than the digital set-top penetration, which is publicly reported. So the actual customer experience taking advantage of the network capability will be a greater experience going forward. They'll have more digital signals, more HD signals, more two-way interactive signals. And the product will be better than what competitive satellite companies can replicate.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, that's helpful. Just a follow-up question for Chris on the liquidity situation. It seems like working capital was a potential contributor this quarter. I'm wondering how you think about that in the context of the full year with respect to working capital to be a positive contributor? And how does that kind of fit into your overall liquidity management? I know you have about $1 billion avail on the facility, yet cash seems to be relatively precariously low. So I'm just kind of wondering whether you view this as a potential constraint to liquidity management and how you tend to address that?","Christopher L. Winfrey","'","I think there's a distinction there between cash being low, and that's just good treasury and good debt management to make sure you're paying down in your revolver and not sitting flush with cash when you don't need to. As to the working capital, it was a good working capital quarter inside of Q1. It's highly seasonal, and you'll see it pop up and down during the course of the year. But from an annual perspective, there's nothing inside the business that makes you the significant user or contributor of cash and we tend to be somewhat working capital neutralized in the past and nothing's fundamentally changed. But there will be seasonality between the quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of question. Chris, can you sort of talk about what was your rate increase, specifically on video? And also on the broadband side, on whether it's also for the service and the hardware component on broadband? And second, more on the strategic side, given your assets are, across, I think 25 states, is there still an aggressive strategy to rationalize and make them more contiguous on doing swaps? And is that market still active right now? Any color on that will be appreciated.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Want to talk about the rate increase?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Sure. So the rate increases for both basic and digital customers as well as Internet range anywhere from $2 to $5, and so roughly 40% of our base got a 3% increase. And that was the -- affected the rate increase. And March was not a full month, and so the first full month will really begin in Q2.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And while there is an opportunity to rationalize assets, we don't discuss M&A activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Alexander Sklar","This is Alex Sklar here for Frank. So you talked about the wireless backhaul backlog being significant. I'm wondering if you could provide any more color on how many fiber-to-the-tower deals you've signed to date and what the total opportunity is there. And then the follow-up on the TiVo question, given what you were saying earlier on finding ways to improve existing boxes rather than spend on new equipment, does TiVo -- is TiVo still going to fit into the long-term plan, or can you go all IP without it?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Maybe on the first question, I'll hand that over to Don Detampel, who heads up our commercial business.","Donald F. Detampel","Thanks, Chris. So as you mentioned, our cell tower pipeline remains very strong. So we reported 2,600 cell towers either in service or under contract, so you can do the math on it. We had a very strong first quarter. I do see that continuing into the near future as carriers continue their push -- their wireless carriers to drive their 4G networks. And these carriers started in largely the Tier 1 markets, and as you know, we serve as primarily Tier 2, Tier 3 markets. So now this bandwidth demand to the towers and their deployment of 4G is kind of moving into our realm and we're very well-positioned with our network to take advantage of it.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And your question about going all IP in terms of set-top boxes, there aren't TVs that are coming on market that are all IP or can take an IP feed, I guess, is a better way of saying it because they can take the regular feed as well. It creates an opportunity to have a cable system that both feeds IPTV and MPEG TV. And there are multiple variations of MPEG as well, which actually, from a technical perspective, are more efficient than IP from a total data throughput perspective. And our network, because of the server-based architecture that we've constructed, can serve multiple kinds of devices. So we can serve legacy set-top boxes with MPEG-2. We can create new hybrid boxes that are IP and MPEG using more efficient MPEG standards for server-based programming. And we can mix and match all of that in the same cable system, and there's enough channel capacity to serve all of those functions. So as I look forward, I think our CPE evolution will result in a world where our incremental cost of CPE per customer will go down as we buy world-class CPE -- world vendor class CPE, and buy that in multiple formats. And so how that'll all evolve, I'm not sure, but the architecture that we've constructed allows us to follow the marketplace to its most efficient place.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company.","Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you remind us how many channels were added in the first quarter?","Thomas M. Rutledge","In terms of HD?","Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Look, there's the multi-market...","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, by market, it's multiple systems, so I think the keys that you want to be thinking about is that at the end of 2010, we were at 43 average HD channels. At the end of 2011, we were at 75, and then we'll be over 100 in -- by midyear.","Thomas M. Rutledge","That's right.","Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And was the lower video-on-demand usage a function of consumers and the economy or more of a function of just the video calendar with not a lot of big movies out?","Thomas M. Rutledge","It's hard to say. The transactional video-on-demand went down, meaning video-on-demand that people pay for it, but the amount of the total product that's available in video-on-demand, including free video-on-demand, is increasing dramatically and usage is increasing dramatically, so that the overall cable platform infrastructure from a VOD perspective is increasingly being used and increasingly being valued by customers.","Robin Gutzler","Great.

My name is Jessa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Charter\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Investor Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. You may begin your conference.","Stefan Anninger","Good morning and welcome to Charter\u2019s third quarter 2019 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","On today\u2019s call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Rutledge","Good morning. Our product and service strategy is working well across all our service areas, and the benefits of the recently completed large integration are being realized through accelerated customer relationship growth, lower service transactions per customer, declining capital, cable CapEx intensity and significant free cash flow generation.","Although our product mix is different today than it was several years ago, we're driving customer relationship growth given our superior products, pricing and network, combined with execution capabilities that continue to improve.","In the third quarter, we had a net gain of 310,000 customer relationships with customer growth of 4% over the last 12 months. We also added 380,000 Internet customers in the quarter, and 1.4 million Internet customers over the last year. And we added 276,000 mobile lines up from 280,000 additions last quarter.","We grew cable adjusted EBITDA by 5% which combined with our lower cable capital expenditures yielded strong year-over-year cable free cash flow growth of nearly $850 million or 125% in the third quarter. Our consolidated free cash flow was up nearly $750 million even including our investment in spectrum mobile.","We offer high quality products packaged with good service and attractive pricing, which is our core operating strategy. That approach works with customers and leads to improving relationship, growth rates, profitability and cash flow over long periods of time.","We continue to improve our products and service, and as a result of our pricing migration strategy, 85% of our residential Internet customers receive 100 megabits and higher speeds and over the past two months, we raised our minimum spectrum internet speed from 100 megabits to 200 megabits in a number of additional markets. We now offer minimum speeds of 200 megabits in approximately 60% of our footprint up from 40% previously.","We continue to offer 400 megabit, our ultra-product and our gigabit speed tiers across our entire footprint. Demand for speed, throughput and low latency uniquely offered through our network today continues to increase. That demand will continue to grow as more devices attached to our network, more IP video is consumed, online gaming continues to grow and new technologies and applications emerge.","Our network will evolve from an already low latency DOCSIS 3.1 to 10 gig symmetrical on an upgrade path we control and at relatively low incremental capital cost.","Monthly data usage continues to rise rapidly. Our non-non video Internet customers use over 450 gigabytes per month, which compares to average mobile usage of well under 10 gigabits per month. That translates to a 50 times price per gig value advantage with truly unlimited service, high throughput, and reliability to all devices in the home in business.","In mid-October, we launched our advanced in-home Wi-Fi in Austin, Texas. Given our network, software operating platform and top rated subs support tool, we\u2019re in a unique position to provide enhanced security privacy and control over all IP devices in our customers home, easily managed by customers in a single app, while simultaneously delivering a superior customer experience through better in-home Wi-Fi coverage, and managed Wi-Fi solutions through dynamic bands switching and channel optimization within the bands. And overtime, we plan to roll this product out to our entire footprint, starting with additional markets in late 2019. Our self-installation program continues to ramp quickly, with customers self-installations now representing 50% of our sales volume.","Turning briefly to video. Over 90% percent of the time when we sell video, it is packaged with internet and it's an important attribute to our selling proposition for fixed and mobile connectivity services. And yet pricing, and lack of security continues to be the main problems contributing to the challenges of paid video growth.","Turning a mobile, our spectrum mobile products continue to perform well and our accelerating mobile line net ads are very encouraging. In the third quarter, Bring Your Own Device capabilities became fully available across all of our sales channels, and Own Devices.","And we recently launched Spectrum Mobile services to small and medium business customers in all channels. Mobile remains a key area of our focus for China going forward and we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of wireline and wireless network convergence overtime with our fully distributed wireline network. Ultimately positioning us for long term growth under the operating strategy I mentioned at the beginning of today's call, superior products, good service and attractive pricing.","Now I'll turn it over to Chris.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks. Tom. Before covering our results, one administrative item. On September 6, we closed the sale of Navisite and managed cloud services business within the spectrum enterprise. We've not prepared [Indiscernible] financials and for the next few quarters I'll discuss enterprise revenue growth, including and excluding Navisite.","On an annual basis, Navisite generated roughly $150 million in revenue and its impact on their EBITDA and CapEx was not material.","Turning to our results on slide five, we grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.1 million in the last 12 months and by 310,000 in the third quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 380,000 in the quarter and by 1.4 million or 5.6% over the last twelve months.","Video declined by 75,000, wireline voice declined by 190,000 and we added 276,000 higher ARPU mobile lines.","84% of our residential customers, including legacy charter were in spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the third quarter. And residential customer relationship growth accelerated to 3.7% year-over-year driven primarily by higher growth at Legacy TWC and Legacy Charter with Legacy Bright House remaining the fastest growing.","In residential internet, we added a total of 351,000 customers in the quarter, better than last year's third quarter, resulting in residential internet customer growth of 5.4% year-over-year driven by continued lower churn and improved connect [ph] performance.","Over the last year, our residential video customers declined by 2.6%. Similar to Internet and overall relationship churn, we benefited from a decline in total video churn, year-over-year, but that was more than offset by lower video gross additions.","In wireline voice, we lost 213,000 residential customers in the quarter, driven by lower sell-in following our transition to selling mobile in the bundle and continued fixed and mobile substitution in the market generally.","Turning to mobile. We added 276,000 mobile lines in the quarter, versus 208,000 in the second quarter, a nice acceleration. As of September 30th, we had 794,000 lines with a healthy mix of both unlimited and by gig lines.","So we're pleased with the trajectory of spectrum mobile, with less EBITDA the loss per line as the business scales to the expected standalone profitability, even at an accelerating net addition rate.","So more importantly, the cable connectivity service benefits and converged platform objectives we've laid out. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 974,000 or 3.7%. Residential revenue for customer relationship grew by 0.8% year-over-year given a lower rate of SPP migration and promotional campaign roll-off in previous rate adjustments.","Those are true benefits were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, higher mix of choice and stream customers, within our video base and $30 million lower pay-per-view revenue year-over-year.","Slide six shows our cable customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth resulted in accelerating year-over-year residential revenue growth of 4.4%. Keep in mind that our cable ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue today.","During the commercial, SMB revenue grew by 5.7% faster than last quarter as the revenue effect from the repricing of our SMB products and Legacy TWC and Bright House continues to slow.","SMB customer relationships grew by 7.7% year-over-year, still healthy growth, but we're increasing speeds and modifying some promotions to re-accelerate SMB relationship growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 1.8% year-over-year or 4.4% excluding Navisite from both quarters given the divestiture.","Excluding both cell backhaul and Navisite, enterprise grew by 7.1%, with nearly 9% PSU growth year-over-year. And so while our re-sell products and enterprise are growing fast, our wholesale business including cell tower backhaul is not, but just factoring into the relative growth rate.","Third quarter advertising revenue declined by 10.6% year-over-year due to less political revenue in 2019. Non-political revenue grew by over 5% year-over-year primarily due to our advanced advertising capabilities and our recent abilities to efficiently sell highly viewed long tailed inventory using our own anonymized much more detailed viewing data.","Other revenue declined by 5.6% year-over-year driven by lower home shopping revenues related to video subscriber declines, and lower late fees, driven by lower non-pay churn, partly offset by video CPE sold to customers.","Mobile revenue totaled $192 million with $123 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 5.1% year-over-year or 5.3% when excluding Navisite. Cable revenue growth was 3.5% or 4.3% when excluding Navisite and advertising.","Moving to operating expenses on slide seven, in the third quarter, total operating expenses grew by $423 million or 6.1% year-over-year. Excluding mobile, operating expenses increased 2.6%. Programming increased 0.4% year-over-year due to higher rates, and that was offset by a higher video subscriber decline or video to subscriber decline of 2.3% resi and SMB year-over-year.","It is also offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages such as Choice and Stream, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the $30 million lower pay-per-view revenue that I mentioned.","Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 12.3% driven by franchise and regulatory fees, original programming cost, and cost of video CPE sold to customers in that order.","Cost to service customers grew by 2.2% year-over-year compared to 4% customer relationship growth. Excluding bad debt, cost-to-service customers were essentially flat. The elevated amount of bad debt in the quarter relates to billing simplification changes we made earlier this year, which pushed out the timing of previous cash collections and resulted in a higher account balance for disconnects and higher bad debt provision in the third quarter.","So we're meaningfully lowering our per relationship service cost, through a number of operating, quality and efficiency improvements which is core to our strategy. Key metrics, like calls for customer, truck rolls per customer, and churn all continue to move in the right direction.","And as Tom mentioned, customer self-installations represented 50% of our sales volume in the third quarter. Cable marketing expenses increased by 0.4% year-over-year and other cable expenses were up 6.7% driven by software cost, enterprise labor cost, and insurance.","Mobile expenses, totaled $337 million and were comprised of mobile device costs, tied to the device revenue, subscriber acquisition and usage cost, and operating expenses to stand up and operate the business, including our own personnel and overhead cost, and our portion of the JV with Comcast.","When including the mobile EBITDA startup loss of $145 million total adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.4% in the quarter. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 5% in the third quarter, including a roughly 1.7% negative growth rate impact from advertising revenue, net of its associated expense in both periods.","Similarly, cable margin expansion year-over-year would have been 90 basis points versus the 60 basis points we're showing today excluding the effect of advertising sales.","Turning to net income on slide eight, we generated $387 million in net income attributable to chartered shareholders in the third quarter versus $493 million last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a non-cash pension [ph] measurement gain in the prior year period, and higher interest expense, partly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization expense.","Turning to slide nine and capital expenditures totaled $1.65 billion in the third quarter, with our Cable CapEx declining by over $500 million year-over-year, driven by lower CPE and installation CapEx due to fewer SPP migrations year-over-year and the completion of all digital in 2018.","There's also the positive capital effect of increasing self-installations, lower video sales and a higher mix of boxless video outlets. Scalable infrastructure also declined, driven by the completion of DOCSIS 3.1 last year and the associated benefit, bandwidth benefit in 2019.","Supports spending for cable was also lower, driven by declining investments related to insourcing and integration. We did spend $100 million in mobile related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital, and was driven by retail footprint upgrades for mobile and software some of which is related to our JV with Comcast.","Despite likely spending a bit less than the $7 billion of total Cable CapEx in 2019, we expect our Cable CapEx intensity to continue to decline next year. As a percentage of revenue, we're becoming very efficient with capital expenditures, despite our continued products, network and service quality investments.","Slide 10 shows; we generated nearly $1.3 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, including just over $250 million in investment in the launch of mobile. Excluding mobile, we generated over $1.5 billion of cable free cash flow, up nearly $850 million versus just last year\u2019s third quarter.","We finished the third quarter at $74.2 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate, annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in October is $3.9 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our net-debt to last twelve months adjusted EBITDA was 4.47 times. We intend to stay at\/or just below the high end of our 4 times to four and a half times leverage range. And when calculating our leverage, we include the upfront investment in mobile to be more conservative than looking at capable only leverage, which was 4.34 times at the end of Q3.","During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million in charter shares, and charter holdings common units, totaling $3.1 billion at an average price of $398 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased $25 billion or 23% of Charter\u2019s equity at an average price of $337 per share.","As I've said before, our operating model, network capabilities, now in the future, and our balance sheet strategy all work together over long periods of time. We expect our results to reflect the growing infrastructure assets with a lot of ancillary products to use for and so on top of our core connectivity services, with good value and service to our customers to grow cash flow with tax advantaged levered equity returns.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Please go ahead","Jonathan Chaplin","Thank you. I'm wondering if you can contextualize the pace of wireless growth we're seeing at the moment. Chris, there was obviously a phenomenal acceleration quarter-over-quarter. Is that driven by the new iPhone cycle or is this sort of a run rate of growth that you think can continue, or can you even continue to accelerate from here?","Tom Rutledge","Jonathan, its Tom. I'll answer the question. You know we, I guess the short answer is we expect it to accelerate. And the reason that is as we've really just got all of our marketing and operating tools available across all the platforms that we operate in, and as we look at the yield that we're taking out of each sales channel we have, and we look at things like Bring Your Own Device and its implementation and its effect on sales, we think that will continue to accelerate the growth rate.","And things like store build out, and other kinds of activities are not complete. So in terms of our marketing footprint, it's not completely deployed yet. And when we look at the kinds of yields we're getting in those channels, our expectation is that our mobile yield will continue to accelerate.","Jonathan Chaplin","And Tom, how much of a pull through is that having on the broadband business at the moment?","Tom Rutledge","It's hard to say, but we think it is having an effect. And we -- our hope is that that that will accelerate broadband growth as well.","Jonathan Chaplin","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Tom, you you've been talking for many quarters now about mitigating piracy and you brought that up again today with some of your carriage deals talk about working together especially with the Disney and the Fox deals on addressing that. Can you sort of talk about what can be done? When is it getting done? Is it something we should expect improving video trends?","And second, obviously you've seen some of your competitors of your peer group launch products that enable your broadband customer like the Flex product at Comcast. Is that something that you guys are considering too? Thank you.","Tom Rutledge","Yes. So I feel like I'm beating my head against the wall talking about privacy or piracy and the password sharing and the pricing, but they're all inter-related issues. I think that there is some recognition in the programming industry that they're now distributors, and as a result of being distributors that they need to know where their content is going, and that has not been part of their DNA. And so, streaming products have been sold with five streams and with no location based kind of security. Most households in the United States have two or less people in them. And as a result of that, there are more streams than there are households available for free.","And by sharing passwords and by not having location based or subscriber based relationships with those streams, and the fact that TV everywhere allows for massive numbers of streams replicated through virtual MVPDs and so forth. There are -- it's just too easy to get the product without paying for it. And when we look at data consumption, we can see that video consumption isn't going down even when people disconnect their paid video. And as a result of that, it makes the price value relationship really difficult when it's free.","And so what can be done? You know the people that own content are going to have to come up with standards of security and they're going to need to implement them and they're needed to -- and they're going to need to know where their services are being viewed and then and they need to have a business model, that works for them. And so that requires some effort and some collaboration. And we'll continue to push for it, but it's a slow process.","Vijay Jayant","Second question is for Flex.","Tom Rutledge","Flex. Yes, I'm sorry. We have discussed that with Comcast and it's an interesting idea, and so I would say that, if we were considering it and it has advantages. We have a significant number of app based relationships that we've developed on multiple devices, and that strategy is working for us. And but putting inexpensive devices out with your service makes some sense to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Supino from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","PeterSupino","Good morning. Could you all please talk about how you're measuring and analyzing the benefit of the large investments that you've made in customer facing personnel in the acquired systems? In particular, I wonder if the results in the Legacy Charter footprint tell us anything, whether it's the level or the trend of profitability and productivity about the future for the acquired system? Thank you.","Tom Rutledge","Yes, Peter. We \u2013 as you know our strategy is to have high quality, well-paid workers with high skills who can interact with the customers in a way that satisfies the customer the first time they deal with the customer. And as a result of that you end up with less transactions, you end up with less repeat service calls, you end up with longer tenured customers with more satisfaction and as result of that you have less disconnects and connects churn and your cost to serve goes down and even though your cost per transaction goes up. And that's been our strategy since Legacy Charter and that's been the strategy across the whole integration of the company.","And that is successful in our -- if you look at our cost to serve trends, they're coming down. What that really means is that our activity levels are coming down. And as a result of our activity levels coming down our customers are more satisfied in their average life or the cash flow per customer is going up is another way of saying it. And that \u2013 so we do see a continued growth in Legacy Charter and we expect that kind of continued growth and when I say growth, I mean, in customer satisfaction and in customer growth and in the increasing margins and lower cost to serve in that environment. And we're seeing it across our entire footprint now because we've been at this integration for a while and we did implement this strategy.","We have brought almost all of the transactions that we're going offshore, back onshore. We rebuilt call centers. There was a period where we had capital intensity and operating intensity as a result of the duplication that was required to stand up a new workforce in the United States, but that has been largely accomplished and we expect to reap the benefits.","Chris Winfrey","Peter, one thing I'd add to that. We've virtualized our entire call center and the field operations service infrastructure, but we still have visibility obviously into the Legacy Charter franchise areas and DMAs. And so what you can see is that Legacy Charter metrics, operating metrics whether it's calls for customer, billing calls for customer, retention calls for customer, truckloads for customer, all remained significantly below Legacy, TWC and Bright House despite Legacy, TWC and Bright House having significant improvements. Part of that is because of the previous investments in the Legacy Charter, Infrastructure, a part of that is Legacy Charter has continued to get better and better every year and quarter-over-quarter continues to make pretty significant improvements.","So it\u2019s a moving target, which just means that when you make that upfront investment in service, it\u2019s a virtuous cycle of continuing to get better and better and while we don't report or track the P&L of Legacy Charter because the service is virtualized, if it had one at our cost to serve there would have been continuing throughout the cycle. They continue to go down dramatically on it per relationship basis and we expect the same for the rest of\u2026","Tom Rutledge","Yes. It bodes well for the long term. We've had continuous improvement in charter over seven or eight years and we expect similar kinds of results throughout the infrastructure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. Tom, you talked a lot about the advantage, the cable, infrastructure and architecture brings to your charter and cable companies you run in the past. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the next several years of network evolution for the business. You've been throwing more speed at customers. You talk a lot about 100 and 200 megabit minimums. How are you thinking both from a kind of a network architecture perspective that would help us think about kind of product opportunities and also capital intensity? I think there's a debate in the market about DOCSIS 4.0 versus deep fiber.","I'm just wondering where do you take the network and therefore the product offering on the broadband side over the next couple years and what might that mean for capital intensity? And I just quick one for Chris, just more short-term, you guys had some rate adjustments in the fourth quarter that a lot of folks have focused on. I'm just wondering how you would describe those in the grand scheme of charter's philosophy and whether there sort of incremental enough that we should be thinking about incremental ARPU and incremental churn in Q4 maybe in Q1 next year since obviously there's been a lot of press coverage and sort of interest in those changes. Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","So, Ben, I think if we look over the next couple of years the best place is start with the last couple of years. And we did the DOCSIS 3.1 rollout over two-year period which took our capability from a couple of 100 megabits per customer up to one gig per customer everywhere we operate. And there's still more upside out of that infrastructure deployment that we made with DOCSIS 3.1 in terms of both speed and things that we can offer from a product perspective, but one of the great thing that's coming out of that, that we didn't really talk about as we did was our ability to manage traffic in the network and therefore reduce network investment associated with increased consumption. And we've had a regular budget item associated with network consumption in our capital planning and related to the growth in overall average consumption of data per customer and 3.1 has allowed us to manage that less capital intensive way.","So you have that project. And if you look at it, it was taking a massive speed increase on a legacy infrastructure at a capital cost of about $9 for home passed, a fairly small investment for home passed with a massive output. And that's the fundamental notion behind our 10 gig strategy, DOCSIS 4.0 strategy, which allows multiple pathways for development depending on how deep you want to take fiber or whether you want to improve your bandwidth in your legacy coaxial network. Both options are available in that specification to upgrade your network as products evolve and in a way that's very capital efficient and strategic to the assets you deployed.","So what would we need to do over the next couple of years? We're still \u2013 we just completed DOCSIS 3.1, so we've got a lot of headroom inside of the asset at the moment in terms of product. But things we're thinking about continuing to do that we're experimenting with. We're obviously experimenting with convergence and we've done a bunch of radio and mobile experiments this year testing, switching dual SIM technology. We've also continue to work on the DOCSIS 4.0 strategy.","We talk to with gaming companies about putting compute power deeper in the network. When you look at real estate footprint we have lots of hubs throughout our architecture that have space in them as a result of the compression of electronic through time. And as a result of that we are able to stand up high compute, low latency networks that are hard to replicate. And we think that there is a product development cycle that'll occur there and give us an upside opportunity. But the fundamental position we're in at the moment is we still have lots of headroom from the last investment cycle we made, which was quite efficient.","We also have been launching as I mentioned the product of in-home Wi-Fi management which allows customers to manage their privacy, their security and to know what is connected in their house and what its connected to and to be able to manage that in an efficient way to not only privacy but for parental control and quality of the network itself throughout the home. So, we're continuing to invest in the customer experience in the product set itself.","Ben Swinburne","That's helpful. Thank you, Chris.","Tom Rutledge","Then you asked about rate, and so maybe some thoughts. Our third quarter, I think you mentioned fourth quarter, so just to clarify, third quarter residential ARPU does not reflect any of the recent rate increases that we have implemented. Those are beginning really at the start \u2013 after the start of Q4, so it won't be a full fourth quarter. And they're being applied in video which reflects higher input of programming cost and some non-promotional rates on Internet. So if you take a look, I know there were some questions around it. You look at our Q3 result results it shows -- we believe we have a long runway for Internet and customer relationship growth. So there shouldn't be too much of a read through that.","We've always believed that creating more customer relationships is the most valuable way to grow long-term cash flow. And through the integration we'd been careful about driving additional billing calls or service transactions from rate increases. And then, I guess another read through as well, manage the profitability of our overall customer relationship when we're using video to enhance it, but that being said, they were rate increases not that materially difference than what we'd had in the past.","We have a lot of customers in year one and year two promotional rates that aren't subject to some of the increases. And for video, we increasingly have a higher mix of customers in wider packages without boxes which won't have the same increases. So our goal is to maintain our competitiveness across all products and their preference or strategy, optimism for growing by volume is opposed to just by rate that remains unchanged. You asked about in the fourth quarter impacts similar to past increases and because it's not that material, some might have feared or hope, and we don't anticipate any meaningful negative impact on the fourth quarter net additions as result of the rate increase.","But I would highlight to you and others just keep in mind, the fourth quarter last year was a pretty good quarter for charter and we expect the back half of this year inclusive of Q3 and Q4 so that things we've said in the past to be better as it relates to Internet and customer relationships. That doesn't mean that we don't expect a good fourth quarter and this year as well. Just keep in mind we had a pretty good one last year too.","Chris Winfrey","So I would say, just to sum that up, our strategy with regard to growth with rates and customers is unchanged. We believe the majority of the revenue growth that we'll produce will be through growth and new customer relationships and our pricing and packaging is designed to give consumers a better value than they can get with the individual products priced as they are in the marketplace. If you look at how much money we're saving people from a mobile perspective, it's significant. Our products are valuable products and they're designed to drive customer relationships.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, guys.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Thanks. Two questions if I could. There's been a lot written recently about your potential interest in CBRS Spectrum and an offload strategy for your wireless business. Could you just put some meat on the bones about that and just talk about what your latest thoughts are about traffic offload and what that network deployment might look like over the next few years?","And then, a second more practical question. We -- the business services lines, you've been engaged in the repricing of the Legacy Time Warner Cable customers for a long time now. When do you think we might be through the process of repricing those customers so that we can start to see business services revenue growth start to normalize a bit relative to where others are and what I suspect your volume growth looks like?","Tom Rutledge","Well, I'll answer the last part of that first which is \u2013 you were already getting the growth in business services where the revenue growth and rate of customer creation are converging and that was not true when we initially started the pricing and packaging, but it is true now if we look at our quarter over quarter change you'll see the revenue growth is occurring and its not because of rate, it's occurring because the customer growth -- they are not new customers at that growth rate that \u2013 and less customers at the historic pricing such that those two numbers are converging growth and revenue growth, customer growth equals revenue growth at some point.","So, in terms of CBRS, the interesting thing about that, and we talked about dual SIM technology opportunities and the testing that we've done and we're quite optimistic about the capability of that strategy and we're quite optimistic about the ability to make select investments in areas where traffic dictates in such a way as to move services that we pay rent for on to our own platform and that opportunity already exists with Wi-Fi and a significant number of our customers -- well the majority of our customers are using Wi-Fi most of the time and Wi-Fi is highly efficient. And the bulk of data, 80% of all data on mobile platforms are being delivered through the Wi-Fi network.","So we think there's continued opportunity to move traffic that way and we've experimented with a bunch of methodologies to do that and CBRS does work very well. And as you know there's a significant amount of free CBRS spectrum available which we've been using. We've also done some experiments with that spectrum with fixed wireless connectivity. We've got an experiment going with that too and actual live customers going in rural low density areas. So it's a pretty valuable piece of spectrum. There's some private spectrum of CBRS that's going to be auction next year. The question we're evaluating is should we be involved in that. But we haven't determined that yet but we're looking at it closely. And but I would say this, but there's a significant amount of spectrum available already. And the more cells you have the less spectrum you need.","Craig Moffett","Thanks Tom.","Tom Rutledge","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hey guys. Thanks. I wonder if we can unpack a little bit the broadband some momentum improvement. Is that being driven mostly by better churn as you had forecasts or by better connect volumes as well? And have there been any changes in the promotional pricing that are being offered to those customers. Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","So you know the churn improvements that we've talked about in the past, they continue on the year-over-year basis for Internet with also an improvement in Connect as service provider, what you said it was a combination of both. There been no major or dramatic change in the pricing or go-to-market as it relates to broadband. And we have a generally now 60% of our footprint, footprint to now 200 megabits per second minimum speed. We also go-to-market with Ultra which is 400 and as a headline with availability, but not that much take up as a one-gig service and that's the 400 and the one-gig or nationwide. So there's been no dramatic change to promotional pricing beyond what we've typically done in the past.","Philip Cusick","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Good morning. Thanks for the question. If we look at the footprint expansion it was about 2% across the different products in the quarter which is above average rate of household growth in the country. So, how important is that growth at driving some of the strength in broadband? And how long can it continue at this elevated pace? And the final part of that is if it were to slow down, does that significantly help your capital spend? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","Yes. So Michael it's a good question. Passings, and it's not unique for Charter rates across the board is really estimated marketable homes, and it's not a direct correlation one-to-one as it relates to new build. And so as we go through the integration of three different companies in the systems and the definitions and even our go to marketable home passed is, we're adding stuff into the builder as potentially marketable and sometimes that rate is not always and you'd only find out once you go and actually market are trying to sell.","So there's a lot of cleanup, that's still going on in that and we're not alone. So I wouldn't take that as 100% new build or household formation, but it's true and it's directionally still right. It may not be completely correct, but it's directionally correct. And we've been building more particularly into rural areas and our new build there you can see that through the CapEx line extension line item that's grown over the past couple of years and accelerated as we meet our commitments. And we have good ROIs to developing a broadband footprint in these more rural areas.","New household formation is helpful to the overall growth rate. There's been a lot of work done around that. We think that our growth is not just a function of new household formation that we are gaining significant share not only in Legacy DSL but as some of the U-verse and U-verse like whether it's AT&T or CenturyLink. There's some of the previous U-verse's speeds turned into looking more and more like DSL as our speeds increase over time. So we're taking significant share and that tends to be the bulk of where we're adding as opposed to just new household formation.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Tom Rutledge","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks. Two questions, first for Tom. You've mentioned 10 gigs quite a bit. Can you just talk about when this might be available and what kind of boost to ARPU? You might be expecting, is this another step up at some point in time. And then second for Chris, is there anything which we should be thinking about in terms of programming expenses for Q4 or 2020 as we update our models? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","Look, 10g 10 gig is a set of specifications that we've developed for our networks that allow us to get to 10 gigabit symmetrical. There aren't products today at the residential level that demand that kind of capability and one -- so it's a long term evolution capability of our network that allows us to in a very efficient way from a capital perspective get to those kinds of capabilities.","If we look at historic trends of data use it'll show you that unless the trends of the last 20 years significantly change at some point we're going to need that capability and products will be develop there, virtual reality products and high capacity, low latency content which would include games and entertainment, education will ultimately be developed including light field products, holograms that will change the very nature of all communications and that our networks capable from an investment perspective of providing those products at the most effective investment rate.","And when we would actually do that or deploy that is really a function of how the market develops. There is no immediate capital requirement for us to do anything with regard to 10G. We can use elements of that as different opportunities arise. We still have a lot of capability in our 3.1 deployment which is a prior DOCSIS deployment specification to 10G which we're now calling DOCSIS 4.0 because we're branders. That's a joke. But it's really just an opportunity and a way of showing the kinds of historic capital investments we've been able to make to upgrade our network will continue into the future.","Chris Winfrey","Marci on and on programming, we've been low this year relative to our expectations on year-over-year growth and part of that is maybe we've done okay on some of our renewals. But the bigger piece is that we've had a subscriber decline of Resi and SMB of 2.3%. There's been a mixed shift as it relates to Stream and Choice products, which just have less channels inside of them. And then on top of that the pay-per-view environment particularly the past two quarters has not been particularly good on the revenue side, which means that your costs are going down year-over-year for pay-per-view and all of that is packing into a current 0.4% year-over-year growth in programming.","But your actual unit cost has expanded cost per customer relationship. It's kind of been what it's been for many years in the mid single digit range. And we've had some pretty big renewals as publicly announced tied to some of the security and password sharing collective efforts, so you know which those are. So there will be some step-up associated with that. But I think as you look out through next year there's nothing we see today that causes there to be a dramatic change from where the overall marketplace has been for the type of rate increases that we expect to see on that product. And as we've talked about before, historically we've not passed all that through to and to our customers and we're evaluating our ability to continue to do that even as we use the video product to drive connectivity services. And we've just spoken about some of that as it relates to the most recent rate increases.","So, I don't expect any big dramatic changes other than growth is a big factor, mix is a big factor, the pay-per-view market has been under some challenge past two quarters which is lower than programming expense, it's unclear how much that'll continue. But absent the volume and mix issues, so I don't see anything dramatic changes.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Hey guys. Thanks. Maybe Tom just a quick comment on the Stream product, what you're seeing there as far as perhaps cannibalization of traditional linear. And then why not use that as a more aggressive tool because the pricing for that double play is a lot more attractive than some of these synthetic bundles out there with offerings. Then, sorry if I missed this, but on the wireless side any comments on the Altice's pricing. And then I guess thinking about the pacing of ads obviously a big ramp up. How should we think about that as we go into 4Q? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","I guess in terms of Stream, we've been selling that to people who are financially constrained mostly in a very selective way. And that's a big problem in the whole video space in that the traditional bundled product is very expensive and the rate -- actual unit rate of that product continues to rise and that's priced a lot of people out of the market. And as I said earlier it's free to a lot of consumers who have friends with passwords.","And so our ability to sell that product is ultimately constrained by our relationship with content. And we have to manage that in terms of the kinds of power that the content companies have in terms of what we can do with bundling and not. And so, it's really a limited solution for us in terms of video. And the bulk of our customer relationships long term and video will continue to be big packaged, expensive bundles of content because that's where it's sold to us and dictated that we provide it in that form.","In terms about Altice's pricing, it's good. And our pricing is quite valuable to consumers and saves them an enormous amount of money on an annual basis. And we think that our pricing is good in terms of driving growth and they want to sell their product at$20, so I think that's great. Its attractive pricing, it's a different MVNO with a different operator and over a different timeframe. But I think it's generally good for cable that they're out there driving and pushing that type of an aggressive product as well.","Mike McCormack","Great. Chris just on the phasing of wireless subs?","Chris Winfrey","Yes. And I think Tom was asked a question by Jonathan early on the pace of growth. We did -- we're still hitting our full stride. And you'd said that all of our BYOD was fully implemented through the end of the quarter, SMB had just barely started to launch, actually hadn't really launched in earnest by the end of the quarter. And our store footprint is going to continue to expand. And so\u2026.","Tom Rutledge","All of our sales channels continue to perform better\u2026","Chris Winfrey","To get better our yield continues to get better. So I'd say, it's still a relatively news upstart business and so there's some risk in saying what we're saying, but we don't see any reason that it shouldn't continue to get better and to have more sales and more yield and more net additions over time and add more value to cable.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Great. Chris, I just want to follow up on your on your comments that the company is getting more efficient in its use of capital. A, does that suggest a sort of another step down in capital intensive as we look out to 2020? Can you give us some examples of how that that's the case and is that your view that the business model in general is getting more capital efficient as we move more towards a connectivity model and then less from \u2013 and away from a video centric model?","Chris Winfrey","Yes. John, you're trying to dupe me into 2020 guidance on capital when we told you we'll do that some time in 2019. So and -- now look I'm not going to talk about a dollar amount for 2020. It's way too early for that, and I'm not sure that we're going to anyway. But what I did say today and we feel strongly about is that our cable capital intensity, so cable capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is going to continue to decline into 2020 for all the reasons that we've mentioned before.","Just the mere fact that integration spend continues to decline is essentially be gone next year, and also the amount of DOCSIS 3.1 headroom that Tom talked about before. The point that you just raised that increasingly video is more and more boxless, and as it becomes tied to the IP Internet product anyway, it's becoming less capital intensive. And I think there's a lot of factors inside the business that are driving us to be much lower capital intensity. I could go down less more self-installation and the head room inside the network, the lack of CPE per connect, and the use of box was connect. The average age of our existing boxes meaning they can be replaced one for one, as opposed to new boxes being purchased to replace old boxes.","It's just -- you know the amount of churn inside the business. If you think about churn coming down that also takes down your capital significantly. So there's a lot of momentum in the business to not only remove your cost or lower your costs to serve for customer relationship on OpEx than related to the same thing on a CapEx basis. And ultimately a lot of that CapEx is fixed, CapEx for the network, and to the extent you have higher penetration, they were probably the fastest growing cable company at least in the western world.","And when you have that type of growth, and that type of penetration expansion, image become more efficient on your capital as well as your OpEx. And so we're seeing the benefit of all of that.","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks guys.","Tom Rutledge","All right. Thank you everyone. We look forward to doing the same next quarter. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"4940":["Charter Communications, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Charter's First Quarter 2017 Investor Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger, you may begin your conference, sir.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to Charter's first quarter 2017 investor call. Presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filing including our most recent proxy statement and forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures as defined by Charter may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. We will also refer to pro forma results.

Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Stefan. As we near the first anniversary of the close of our transactions, we're successfully integrating Time Warner Cable and Bright House, and our operating and strategic plans are on track. By the end of the first quarter, we have launched our pricing and packaging everywhere but Hawaii where we will also launch shortly. As a result, we've finally turned the corner, and we are seeing higher year-over-year customer and PSU connect volumes with nearly all of our video connects purchasing are expanded basic video product. And our minimum Internet speeds are either 60 megabits or 100 megabits depending on the market.","And although churn and downgrade activity from the legacy TWC low-value product set remains elevated, we expected that to be the case, that the low-value product churn and downgrade activity will improve as more customers connect to our new pricing and packaging.","As of the end of the first quarter, 17% of Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers were in our new pricing and packaging. And in areas where we had the Spectrum in place for at least two quarters, 32% of our residential customers have had the Spectrum product set. That result is slightly ahead of our expectation and where we were at Legacy Charter at this point in our plan.","Legacy Bright House is performing extremely well. Our Spectrum pricing and packaging, combined with a better starting point in terms of its service reputation, has allowed us to accelerate growth within that footprint more quickly.","Legacy Charter also continues to perform. Customer relationships grew nearly 6% year-over-year, even though our focus was on integration. We remain very confident that there is a large and long-term customer and financial growth opportunity across all three Legacy companies.","This quarter, we will restart our all digital project in the 40% of Time Warner Cable and 60% of Bright House that is not yet all digital by putting two-way interactive boxes on every outlet and freeing up capacity to increase data speeds. That project should last through early 2019. The integration of our field operations, customer operations and network operations is well underway and progressing as planned.","We have been able to avoid customer disruption and we're increasingly in-sourcing our field operations and call center employees in Legacy Time Warner Cable and Legacy Bright House markets in order to improve our craftsmanship, plant, and service delivery. And we're already reducing reliance on third-party call centers and contractors.","Our product development efforts also continue to move forward. We're working toward launching a wireless service in 2018 under our MVNO agreement with Verizon. We're also testing the capacities of our network with 5G-like services in a number of Spectrum bands and in a number of locations. We intend to use these field trials to provide us with better insight into the capabilities of our wireline network when using high-frequency licensed and unlicensed spectrum, and how our various wireless network building blocks can be used in conjunction with one another to offer services that were developed over time.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to provide more details on the quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. During the first quarter, total customer relationships grew by 4.3% year-over-year on a pro forma basis with 3.4% at TWC, 5.8% at Legacy Charter and 6.3% at Bright House.","Slide 6 shows we grew residential PSUs by 365,000 versus 757,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was primarily driven by elevated customer and product churn from the Legacy customer base at TWC.","As Tom mentioned, at the end of the first quarter, 17% of TWC and Bright House customers are now in Charter's pricing and packaging. This is available everywhere for residential customers except Hawaii which launches next month.","Bright House markets were completed first back in November, and together with a better value and service proposition in the Legacy base, you can see the positive effects of our new pricing and packaging already. And those TWC markets that had launched Spectrum as at December 31, relationship and video connects were up versus last year's quarter with better quality product and sales as Tom mentioned.","At the same time, Legacy TWC promotional offers in the past have been rolling to high rates on lower value legacy products, which is why TWC billing and retention call rates have been 50% to 60% higher than Charter's. And as we've implemented consistent retention policies nationwide, we're managing through higher churn at TWC in the short term. As we migrate and replace the legacy base through a disciplined approach, legacy TWC churn will improve.","Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by 3.2%. Pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 0.5%. And Bright House lost 1.1% of its residential video customers but continues to significantly improve its year-over-year video results.","TWC's video net loss was 129,000 worse than last year, with over 90% of legacy TWC's 108,000 net video losses driven by churn from lower-value limited basic packages. Legacy Charter lost 13,000 video customers versus a gain of 10,000 a year ago. Bright House added 21,000 video customers in the quarter versus a loss of 7,000 last year. In total, we lost 100,000 residential video customers in the quarter, primarily driven by the losses at TWC.","In residential Internet, we added a total of 428,000 customers during the quarter versus 520,000 last year. And over the last 12 months, our total residential Internet customer base grew by close to 1.4 million customers or close to 7%, with over 8% growth at pre-deal Charter and over 9% at Bright House. In voice, we grew customers by 37,000 in Q1 versus 213,000 last year, the lower growth largely driven by higher churn at TWC, in part driven by a low-price promotional voice offer in TWC markets in prior-year quarters.","Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 951,000 or by 3.9%. Residential revenue per customer was virtually flat year-over-year given much smaller price increases this year versus last and continued standalone Internet sell-in.","Legacy Charter's customer ARPU declined year-over-year primarily driven by the continued strength of Internet single play sell-in and the lack of meaningful rate increases year-over-year.","As slide seven shows, our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 4.2% with a different mix of rate and volume across the Legacy entities. Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined, grew by 10.8%. SMB revenue grew by 11.3% and enterprise grew by 10.1%. Excluding cell backhaul and NaviSite, enterprise grew by 15%. Enterprise launched the new national pricing structure at the end of last year designed to drive higher customer growth, and we'll do the same with SMB at Legacy TWC and Bright House in the middle of the year.","First quarter advertising revenue declined by 7.7% year-over-year, driven by political advertising in the prior year. Excluding political and barter, advertising revenue was down about 2% year-over-year. In total, first quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 4.3% year-over-year and up 4.8% when excluding advertising.","Looking at total revenue growth at each of the Legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 4.1%, driven by a mix of customer and ARPU growth. Pre-deal Charter grew by 4.4% driven exclusively by customer growth. And Bright House revenue grew by 5.4% with improving unit growth and little reliance on rate.","Before moving on to expense, I wanted to note two items which impacted our revenue growth in the quarter. In March, we decided to provide bill credits to certain TWC residential customers. And in last year's first quarter, TWC and Bright House revenue benefited from a contractual settlement. Excluding the impact of those items, total revenue growth would have been 4.7% of consolidated Charter or 5.2% excluding advertising.","Moving to operating expense, in the first quarter total operating expenses grew by $201 million or 3.2% year-over-year with transition expense accounting for $51 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Excluding programming and transition, operating costs were essentially flat given the realization of transaction synergies and continued operating efficiencies at Legacy Charter.","Programming increased 8.2% year-over-year driven by contractual rate increases and renewals and a higher expanded mix, partially offset by transaction synergies. Regulatory connectivity and produced content expense declined 1.5% year-over-year as we start combining the company's networks and contracts.","Cost to service customers was essentially flat year-over-year despite 4.3% total customer relationship growth, reflecting financial benefits from the combination of three companies and lower service transactions per customer and churn Legacy Charter.","Marketing expense declined by 1.5% year-over-year as we continue to drive synergies from our transactions, and other expenses were also down year-over-year driven by elimination of duplicate costs.","Taking a step back on expense, the full elimination of duplicate costs will take another two years as we fully integrate the platforms of three companies and multiple billing, provisioning and network environments. And in areas of the business with labor and third-party costs tied to systems, we've actually been temporarily adding cost as we maintain legacy systems and processes and prepare for back-office integration.","That's all according to plan, and so similar to subscriber, revenue and cost to service trends, our expense development will not be linear. But our views on the long-term growth and profitability potential for Charter remain the same. In fact, our confidence has grown. Same applies to the transaction synergies I outlined on the last call.","Adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.4% in the first quarter, and excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.3%. If you further exclude the two revenue items I mentioned, both in 2016 and 2017, EBITDA would've grown by over 8%.","Turning to net income on slide nine, we generated $155 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter, versus net income of $179 million on a pro forma basis last year. This higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter this year more than offset by higher depreciation and amortization, driven by purchase accounting and last year's CapEx and other below the line operating expenses, including transaction-related severance costs.","Turning to slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $1.56 billion in the first quarter, including $76 million of transition spend. First quarter capital intensity as a percentage of revenue of 15.3% should not be straight lined as we had timing delays on some big network projects, facilities and truck spend, as well as vendor delays and staging CPE. Excluding transition CapEx, first quarter CapEx declined by $302 million year-over-year or 17% with lower spending on scalable infrastructures, CPE and support capital, mainly driven by timing.","As slide 11 shows, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter versus negative $61 million of actual, not pro forma, of free cash flow in the first quarter last year. And that growth was largely driven by cash flow from acquired systems. Working capital did not have a meaningful impact on our free cash flow this quarter and they're often large quarterly swings. But for the full year 2017, I'd expect working capital to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on our free cash flow.","We finished the quarter with $61.3 billion in debt principal. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense is currently $3.4 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggested $2.9 billion annual run rate. That difference is due to purchase accounting.","At the end of the first quarter, our net debt the last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.0 times and our long-term leverage remains at 4 times to 4.5 times. In February and March, we issued a total of $2 billion of 10-year 5.125% notes at CCOH with the proceeds being used to call $750 million of CCOH 6.625% notes and repay $2 billion of 5.85% TWC notes.","On March 30, we concurrently offered and priced $1.25 billion of notes in the high yield market and at the same time $1.25 billion of notes in the investment grade market for a total of $2.5 billion. The proceeds from those notes will be used for general corporate purposes including potential buybacks.","Our weighted average cost of debt is now 5.4%. The weighted average life of 11.6 years with 90% of our debt repayable after 2019. And our hybrid debt structure gives us access to the bank, investment grade, and high yield markets providing us significant operating, financing, and strategic flexibility.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares in Charter Holding common units totaling approximately $826 million at an average price of about $324 per share. I mentioned on our last call that from late in the fourth quarter through Q4 earnings in February, we were not buying shares due to parameters set in an earlier 10b5-1 program. Share repurchase activity will continue to depend on other potential uses of capital and market conditions.","Turning to our tax assets on slide 13, we estimate the total value of those assets is approximately $6 billion, and we don't expect \u2013 we don't currently expect to be in the general cash income tax payer until 2019 at the earliest.","So, getting ahead of next quarter's reporting, I wanted to note that we have now aligned Bright House's seasonal customer program with that of Legacy Charter and Time Warner Cable, which provides a reduced monthly charge instead of onetime suspend and restart fees historically at Bright House. As a result, seasonal customers at Bright House will now remain as reported customers throughout the year which will reduce both the negative net adds impact in Q2 and the positive net adds impact in Q4 when comparing to historicals.","In the second quarter of 2016, there were approximately 60,000 seasonal customer disconnects with most of the seasonal reconnected volume are currently in Q4. We'll do our best to quantify the year-over-year onetime reporting effect at Bright House when we report Q2 and Q4.","With that, operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Maybe if we could just talk about the Legacy Charter markets. You guys saw a 13,000 sub-decline in the quarter, and I guess it's driving the ARPU, sort of accelerating decline. Any color on sort of what's going on in the market? Is it cord cutting? Are you seeing some sort of economic weakness or \u2013 it doesn't seem like it's competitive issues. But maybe how you expect that \u2013 those sub-trends to develop over the course of the year and have we seen the worst in terms of the ARPU decline? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","It's Tom. Look, I think given all the integration activity that the year-over-year Charter Legacy would've been positive if we weren't doing all this activity. We moved a lot of assets around it at different management structures during the period, and a slight change in the direction of the video customer growth. The subscriber growth in general is still performing well in the marketplace as we expected, and I think you'll see that accelerate in the future. So, I think the \u2013 I don't think it's a significant issue, but I also think it is an effect of our integration process more than anything else or any specific change in the market.","Our opportunity with regard to video, I think there's market share shift from satellite to us. I do think there is a general decline in MVPD marketplace that is mostly price-driven, and I think that those trends are unlikely to change in the near term but not to particularly accelerate. And so I think that the Charter opportunity in video and subscriber growth in general in Legacy and in new footprint continues to improve.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","From an ARPU perspective, the big driver there really isn't anything that's happening systemically in the market. It's really just about the amount of single-play Internet sell-ins. So, if you take a look at the percentage of the non-video customer relationship base and the percentage growth in the next \u2013 in the new, compare that to total customer relationship growth, there are ways that you can mathematically get to figure out what the full effect of that mix shift is. And that's really what the big driver there is on ARPU.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I think the other thing about ARPU that's significant and in the way our numbers work is that there is virtually no rate in these ARPU numbers. So, it's all driven by subscriber growth. And we want it that way. And we think in this environment of integrating three companies and introducing ourselves to lots of new customers and customer relationships that that's the appropriate approach.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Tom, maybe just a comment. We've seen a lot of over-the-top launches. We saw this report yesterday obviously, and we know what the mix is. But just thinking about the threat of that and how much of an impact you're seeing from that. And then maybe secondly, your thoughts on the Charter plans. There's been a lot of discussion around 5G deployments and how you guys sort of see yourselves playing it out over time. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Right. Well, as I said, I think obviously we sell more than video, and we're creating lots of customer relationships. And we expect to continue to do that. We expect to be able to continue to create video customer relationships too because we think that our two-way interactive footprint and our capability of providing SVOD in an appropriate user interface, along with the kind of linear channels we've historically provided and other on-demand services, makes us a more compelling product than our competitors. And so we expect to grow video.","What the overall share of over-the-top providers will be over the next five years, I don't really know. But none of them have a product that is better than ours that we can see in the marketplace. So, we expect to succeed in the marketplace going forward.","With regard to 5G, we've been experimenting with frequencies. But basically, our view of it is that small cell connectivity to our high capacity network is our future and our current state of wireless. We have Wi-Fi devices in almost every home. The speeds that you can get out of our current Wi-Fi routers incrementally is in the range of a gigabit, and we expect that to accelerate with the addition of additional frequencies in the millimeter waves type spectrum that 5G is proposed in and other spectrum that will become available in the future.","So, we think that speeds will continue to increase in the home and in the workplace. And if we need to put that into a mobile environment that our plant in and of itself that as well in the long run. So, at this point, those kinds of 5G opportunities are still a number of years away, and they're certainly even farther away from a market-wide deployment perspective. But we are using experimental licenses to test our capabilities across the spectrum.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks a lot. Because I'm wondering if you could just expand on your ARPU comment from M&A (25:27), I'm wondering specifically what the growth in broadband ARPU is in the Legacy Charter footprint. And I understand not wanting to take rates while you're going through the integration and seeding a new base with new packages and pricing. When do you think you'll be in a position to start pushing up rate again and accelerating ARPU growth?","And then my last question will be, not that we're sort of one year- we'd sort of lapped the one-year mark on the integration. But we're at the sort of the most difficult part at this point in shifting subscribers over to the new pricing and packaging such that we should start to see an improvement in the back half of the year or is that still a quarter or two away?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","That was a mouthful. Let me start to answer the broadband ARPU question. My comment earlier was more about total customer relationship ARPU.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Right.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And the impacts that multiple PSUs per relationship have on that. And so to the extent that you have a higher mix of Internet stand-alone or non-video bundles, then it has the impact of artificially pulling down your customer relationship ARPU. It wasn't so much about that ARPU per PSU. We actually don't manage the business that way. Our goal is to get as much ARPU per household by providing high-value products as possible.","And so we haven't done anything to materially impact at Legacy Charter, the broadband ARPU, other than having a slightly higher amount of single play which if you were to look at as stand-alone PSU ARPU would suggest that the broadband ARPU is increasing slightly. The fallacy of that is that we sell, for the most part, broadband inside of a bundle, and at that point it's just an allocation of revenue across the different products that's on the bill. And it's really, from our perspective, more about pricing all the services in the household and putting as many of those services in as we can.","Pricing, I think if you can take a look back to what Charter's historically been able to do is with very minimal price increases be able to grow total customer relationships by 6% and residential customer relationships by 5%. And if you see the opportunity to go get that type of growth and to have that type of market share shift, introducing pricing can stunt that growth. And it doesn't mean that you've lost pricing power or rate power over time. In fact, one might argue that it's actually increased because of the larger base.","And if you have the opportunity to grow, we think it's much better to grow. And if you stop growing and you need to get revenue growth, you always have the ability to take rate. But that's not really Charter's strategy and we see the opportunity to grow, and I think that's the better path.","Tom, I don't know if you would add anything to that but...","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","No. I think that it's been our strategy to create high value, high quality products that improve the life of the customer. And that results in not necessarily ARPU growth that comes from rate, but ARPU growth that comes from the creation of customers. It also reduces costs and so increases EBITDA relative to ARPU at a better rate if your customer service experience adds to average customer lifetime length. What that does is it reduces transaction volume, which means that for the same amount of revenue, you have a higher EBITDA because your costs, connects or servicing the customer go down.","So, our view of the model is that it's much more virtuous to have high-quality, high-value products that last in the marketplace, meaning customers like the products, think they're fairly priced and continue to subscribe to without looking around and trying other competitors and increasing your cost of operation.","So, while we expect to grow our ARPU and we expect to grow our customer base, we expect most of that to occur because the quality of our products stand in the marketplace and people want to subscribe to us as opposed to trying to use temporary friction in the marketplace to get a rate.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","And at the one-year mark?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, we had one year-- we have a multiyear strategy. And as I said in our \u2013 in my remarks, we have turned the corner in terms of year-over-year growth in connects. And that's a good sign and it's the first sign that you expect after you change every price and package and process involved in the selling of a business with 26 million customers and growing at 4%.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","The more customer relationships that we have in Spectrum pricing and packaging, the more protected we are for all the reasons that Tom mentioned, and that's why we read out that statistic. And it's line with what we had at Legacy Charter at this stage. And in fact it's actually slightly above. So, we're pleased. But until you either migrate or churn the legacy base that has low-value, high-priced products, you're going to have a little bit of volatility from one quarter to the next. But that number's increasing. It's growing well, and I agree with Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, you're really looking at what is the EBITDA per customer you're gaining on the increment and are you piling those up one after another in an appropriate way so that your long-term outcome is good. And we believe that we're doing that and we've turned the corner on that, which is what our plan was.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jonathan. Kim, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Tom, now that the incentive auction is over and Comcast bought Spectrum and its footprint not nationally, that leaves you without a sort of coverage layer of low frequency. Can you talk about that at all? Was that part of your plans, or is it still -- or is it part of your plans to think about a coverage layer to augment the MVNO, or is the MVNO a satisfactory full solution to wireless beyond your Wi-Fi network?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","As you know that that low frequency opportunity is still from a practical point of view a number of years away. So, it has no impact on sort of a short midterm opportunity in the marketplace. We think that the MVNO does have that potential. And so we're happy with our MVNO. We're happy with going forward with it and don't feel today that we have any need for that kind of spectrum. And we think that if we ever do have such a need that opportunities will be available and get it.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. Kim, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. So, two questions. First, on the video product. Tom, you talked about how video trend should accelerate. Can you talk about some of the initiatives that you're working on, perhaps the programming, exclusive agreements with AMC, maybe Netflix or YouTube into the box? Just some of the things that you're working on in the pipeline that we should be thinking about.","My second question is on cost. Can you just give us an update, Chris, on kind of the synergies and where we are in that $1 billion mark? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So, Amy, in terms of things we're doing with the product and AMC, the AMC opportunities and experiment to see if we can create some high-value product for our customers for a period of time, and we think it's an interesting opportunity to put original programming to our customers and still allow the market place realities in terms of the cost of amortizing programming to work over a bigger market place over time. And so we're interested in finding ways to improve our video product and we have lots of thoughts about those. AMC is one step in that direction.","Netflix is being integrated into our user interface and we plan to launch it. We've had similar discussions with YouTube. Our view is that the user interface that we're deploying across our footprint will allow a seamless integration of content. Fundamentally, we expect customers to subscribe to services like Netflix, Hulu and other over the top products in combination with our MVPD products and maybe over the top products that we also provide.","And we think having a common user interface that allows that to work on all the devices in the house makes a lot of sense. Our fundamental obligation to our customer is to make that customer's life easy in terms of using video. And so, when we look at our whole relationship to content and the customer, we come out toward the customer side of the equation, meaning, while we'd love to creative new content, we'd even more love to have happy subscribers who have access to all the content that they can get. And that's what our user interface is designed to do.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And on the synergies, on the last call I mentioned after the first year we expected to be over $700 million and that after a three-year period we expected to be a over $1 billion. That three-year period is really what I was highlighting about the time it takes to combine network provisioning, billing activities which takes time, so that's the driver for that . We're not going to report quarter-by-quarter how much is in the number because frankly, once we go out to January 1, it became a little more challenging for two reasons. One is that, one, in order to hit those synergies, a lot of times it requires operating investment to combine platforms, systems, people. And then secondly, the programming side, you have to take an estimate of what you think your renewals \u2013 your contractual rate increases for renewals would have been without the deal. So, it becomes a little bit more art than science. And so we wanted to get away from that and provide our best view at that time.","But there's nothing that's impacted our optimism as it relates to the transaction synergies And as I mentioned, programming was one of the harder ones. Since I know that will be the next question, I'll try to hit that one head-on, which is we don't comment on the details on programming agreements, but we are generating the synergies we expected. Sometimes that can be obscured by escalators and existing agreements and renewals. But those renewals, they generally include better starting points, better CAGRs or growth rates they have longer terms when we want them. And we're getting better rights than we believe Charter, TWC or Bright House would receive previously.","And that you're going to see it from one quarter to the next, accounting for the economics of these deals including what some \u2013 one party may see as past or future. It can be complicated and at times, payment streams can be lumpy along the way. But we're focused on the overall economics over a longer term, and we are getting the strategic and financial benefits of the transactions as we laid out.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Kim, we're ready to take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. As you guys think about the rest of this year, I think you mentioned that connect volumes are up year-on-year. Well, you've rolled out Spectrum pricing and packaging which is almost done. So, with that, are you able to look at the churn which are on the pool of Time Warner Cable legacy customers that you would argue or on sort of the wrong package or low-value services. And how much \u2013 how big that pool is and how long it will take to churn them out or get them into the right place? Because if the connects are growing and that churn issue is sort of finite in length then it would help us think about when we might see PSUs start to improve on a year-over-year basis. I don't know if you'd want to talk to some of those puts and takes, but we'd be interested in any comment.","And I just wanted to ask, Chris, if the expectation that CapEx is up year-on-year pro forma is still the right one? I know you mentioned before not the run rate Q1. But just want to throw that out too.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Well, it's the same issue that we faced with Legacy Charter beginning late 2012. Right now, at the end of Q1, 17% of the TWC and Bright House was in Spectrum pricing and packaging, which means we're in a much better position to that 17%.","Flip side is we've got 83% of the base that continues to be in legacy pricing and packaging offers. And that has elevated churn and it's going to, as long as that number remains high. But it'll decrease the amount of customer's Spectrum pricing and packaging with a better term profile will increase. The real question is when you get a tipping point, that's already started to get better from here on out. And so I think right now it looks like it will follow a very similar path as to what we saw at Legacy Charter in terms of subscriber development.","Second question was \u2013 Ben, what was your second question? I think we've lost Ben. Did you make a note of it, Stephanie? (40:28)","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Oh, CapEx.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, year-over-year \u2013 are we still up year over year (40:34).","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","So much passion on the first topic. Everything I said about CapEx last quarter still remains the case. I mean, we're a little bit behind in terms of where we'd like to be on spending on CapEx just because it's timing-related issues. So, in a weird sense, it's going to be tough to hid the plan that we have for CapEx this year. But our intent is still to be able to be in a position to spend more than we did last year. I don't think from the capital intensity it'll be that different from where it was last year just because of revenue growth, but nothing's changed. And since we want to spend the capital so we can grow faster and quicker, our goal is to spend as much as we can this year.","But just on the CapEx issue just to give the speech again, the customer life and the less activity ultimately related to servicing and base of more high-quality customers with high-quality products is, if you have a high-quality service organization, you ultimately end up spending less capital as well, as well as less operating costs and your capital intensity comes down. It comes down due to operational efficiency, but it also comes down due to our ability to go all digital and once that project is completed, to have a lower capital intensity and less activity that is also capitalizable, associated with (42:10).","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Ben. Kim, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a quick one, and then not so quick one. On the quick side, can you quantify just the TWC credits? We're trying to isolate the revenue and ARPU impact. And also talk about if these will continue.","And then, the second question is, with customers migrating to the single-play offering, do you notice behavior differing among the Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets? We can act if maybe the streaming bundles are taking advantage of the disruption in TWC markets. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","The amounts of the credits, we didn't provide it in the Q. So, I don't want to provide preferential disclosure here. But I think if you take the comments we had about the amounts of revenue growth absent those two items, the two items being the credits in 2017 and the onetime contractual settlement in 2016, you can solve for the combination of the two. You also have, if you wanted to go back and take a look, I'm pretty sure that TWC would've disclosed the amounts of the contractual settlement with the programmer that resulted in higher revenue in Q1 2016. So, I'm laying you out a very convoluted map to get there.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Wish you luck. The two items combined is what drove that differential revenue growth that I highlighted in the prepared remarks. I didn't follow the second question, which was more about customer analysis market by market.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","The idea that we're being ticked off in certain places where we have operating issues, we've seen no evidence to that fact. And at this point, we have a fully featured product set in every market we will other than Hawaii, which we'll have shortly priced and packaged the way we want it. So, we're in the right competitive posture, but we're in the posture we want to be anyway.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Marci. Kim, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Two questions. Can you go back to some comments you made earlier about SMB and setting national pricing for the enterprise business? Can you give us some color on where you see the potential upside from your perspective, what the margins could be in that business and how we can measure success or the milestones that we should look for?","And the second question is just on programming cost, can you give us an idea of what to expect for programming cost for the full year versus the 8% in the first quarter?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","On programming cost, I knew it would come up, which is why I said what I did. It's going to be lumpy throughout the year. So, we don't provide guidance generally. And so, I think providing it on one single line item would be somewhat strange to not provide an overall revenue EBITDA or CapEx guidance and then start 200 (45:20) on the single expense line. But we're seeing synergies in the programming side. We are seeing renewals as well. We're getting longer terms, better rights. Longer-terms where we want them, shorter terms where we want them and getting better rights along the way. So, beyond that it's not something we're going to go into a great detail on.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Jessica, with regard to SMB, we have a similar strategy with SMB, to what we have with residential in many ways, which is to create high-value, high-volume opportunities in the market place. And we price and package our SMB product in such a way that we've accelerated unit growth significantly and the revenue growth and ARPU growth catch up with that. And that we expect to have happen just like we do in our residential base.","We've also done that in a new way going forward in the new company with our enterprise business as well. And we \u2013 which is the market above small business. And we are \u2013 we've gone to a lower-priced, higher-volume, higher-quality product mix with a service infrastructure to reduce installation times for all fiber products to businesses. And so we've developed a construction infrastructure, meaning personnel that are able to build fiber infrastructure to new business customers in a rapid way. And by creating more high-value, high-volume products with the capability of getting them installed in a short period of time, we think we can start to move some of that share which we have a very miniscule piece of today. So we're very excited about the future of both SMB but also of enterprise as well.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And the PSUs is the way that you'll see that manifest itself through accelerated net adds growth. And over time, as the volume catches up to the pricing, you'll see it come through revenue.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can you comment on margin potential?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","We don't break out margin.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","We do not, except that the margins act like residential margins in the sense that if you improve your activity levels per dollar of revenue, your margins improve.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jessica. Kim, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. A couple of bigger picture questions. Tom, obviously, you have an IP-only product that I don't think you really market. But we've seen Comcast talk about probably doing something there and you have the satellite guys doing it. Is that something that we should sort of see as a product set in the next few months or you're happy with the current strategy?","And just a question that we get and to sort of understand this Time Warner Cable churn that we're seeing and, obviously, over time you will have the gross adds with the pricing and promotion at Spectrum. Why can't there be a more seamless transition? Are these customers so poor in quality that you wouldn't want to save them, so let them churn, then have gross adds? Again, I'm just trying to understand why do we have that sort of a disconnect rather than a seamless transition? Any...","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Let me take the first one \u2013 the second one first. The TWC churn, somebody was given a $10 unlimited video basic package, where can you move them? And they have an exploding offer. It was promotional offer. Where can you move them that's a satisfactory place relative to what they were given before? Same thing exists across voice. And so we've spoken at length about that before. Now, that we have Spectrum pricing in packaging in place across the entire footprint, is there a better path to migrate them into that pricing and packaging? Yes. But can we completely solve the issues that were installed in the base? Maybe; maybe not.","Your first question was \u2013 and I think more directed at Tom, but I didn't capture which product you were talking about.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Security?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","We don't actively market.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","No. An IP-only TV product.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Oh, IP-only video product?","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Yes. I guess the question is that you have these virtual level UPDs (49:57) out there and some of the incumbent distributors are also looking to launch their versions of it. Just from your perspective, is that something \u2013 is this style on (50:05) IP-only product, is that something you could see in the not-too-distant future?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Look, we do have an IP-only video product. Our entire cable service is IP-only delivered if customers want to receive it that way. So, IP is a format. All of our product can be delivered on any device, in the home, all of our TV Everywhere product can be delivered outside the home anywhere depending on the service relationship and the contractual relationship with the provider. And our \u2013 to the extent we want to sell over-the-top products inside our footprint \u2013 or outside -- in some cases, we have those rights. We haven't done that because we don't really see any opportunity to create new customer relationships out of that that have a high value to us, but we certainly have the capability of doing that.","So, when you say IP, all of our app-based products are IP. All of our products are now service, including our video on demand infrastructure, 50,000 titles are capable of being delivered in IP to any device. And the real question is what's the footprint of the service area. And that depends on the right structure. TV Everywhere obviously can be delivered nationally, and is. The story from the programmer since some of the virtual MVPD operators was that this was going to grow the market, and then the programmers had thought the same as well. I think you should take a look at the evidence so far.","The current OTT offerings that are out there right now just seem to be cannibalizing the same satellite providers and base. And so it's just a shift in what's the base as opposed to actually growing the market. Charter has all the rights and has all the technical capabilities and it has the programming. And if we can put together packages that will generate incremental customers, I think we're uniquely positioned to go to do that over time.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a quick question from Mr. Winfrey. You mentioned all your synergies are on track including programming synergies. And I was just wondering if you could remind us on Fox. If I remember, there was sort of a little bit of a debate around who is the surviving entity, and I just didn't know where that stood and what I really care about is sort of how are you booking it now and is there any risk of sort of an adverse outcome where things get recast adversely, I guess?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I understand the interest, but we're in the middle of a litigation with a few different programmers right now, so I don't think it behooves us to go \u2013 we never have gone to a data programmer-by-programmer detail and I think even more so now that doesn't really \u2013 it's not really in our interest to do that. We're confident that we'll have successful programming relationships for years to come, and we're taking all the appropriate stuffs we needed to from an accounting perspective.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you at least just share how you're looking at now and when you expect resolution to the litigation?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","No, I can't.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher L.

And your final question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Guys, a couple of quick ones. First, Chris, can you expand on \u2013 you said something about network and vendor delays and CapEx in the first quarter. And then second, can you remind us of transition expense, expectations and timing from here? Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Sure. So, you know, I don't want to overplay that. At the beginning of every year, there's an operating plan at a detailed project-by-project level that's getting put in place and it drives orders and sometimes those orders get delayed either from internal submission of the orders or from vendors. So, there's nothing more than that other than we have a lot of moving parts with a lot of projects and to get that organized in place takes a little bit of time.","We have had some supply chain issues as it relates to set-top boxes, none of which has been customer impacting so far. I don't expect it to be. It just means that we're running a little bit light on the inventory compared to where we'd like to be, and that has an impact on capital expenditure in a particular quarter. It also means that when the supply chain flips the other way, you can end up a little heavy on CPE relative to connects just as you go do that. So, it's just timing.","On transition capital expenditure, we'd expect to be through all of that, essentially this year. It doesn't mean that there's won't be \u2013 continue to be some going on beyond. But I think our goal would be to have it down to a stage where there's not a need to separate that anymore beyond 2017 and look at it from a consolidated basis at that point.","Philip A.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Charter Communications Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.","Stefan Anninger","Good morning, and welcome to Charter's 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures as defined by Charter may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that on July 1, 2013, Charter completed its acquisition of Cablevision's Bresnan Broadband Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries also known as Bresnan. Unless otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to on this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Stefan. 2014 was a transformative year for Charter. We successfully digitized our network on time and on plan and introduced a more advanced product called Charter Spectrum. And despite putting nearly all of our customers through an all-digital service transaction, we improved our underlying operating metrics, grew market share across all of our products and improved our financial performance. Our high-capacity network is now unburdened by analog signals, allowing us to offer superior products not replicated by the competition across virtually our entire footprint.","Charter is now a very different company. We're delivering a video product with more HD channels than satellite with full Video On Demand functionality on every television outlet. And our network is now enabled to deliver an interactive IP-based video user interface. Our Internet product is faster than the competition in the vast majority of our footprint, with our slowest speed offering of between 60 megabits and 100 megabits. And over time, our speeds will get faster. We combined these superior video and Internet products with a fully featured voice product and sell it at highly competitive price points. That high value offering, combined with good service, is driving customer growth, market share and greater revenue per household. In turn, our revenue and EBITDA continue to grow, translating into higher EBITDA [indiscernible].","And with all-digital behind us, the capital intensity of our operations and our retained footprint will decline significantly in 2015, driving meaningful free cash flow growth. During the fourth quarter, we added 73,000 new residential customer relationships. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our residential customer base by 5%. Primary service units grew by 157,000, and we added 3,000 video customers. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our expanded basic video by 76,000. So we continue to grow video market share versus the competition. During the fourth quarter, we also added 104,000 broadband customers. And at year end, over 80% of our Internet customer base subscribed to tiers that provided 60 megabits or more. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 9.9% versus 5% for the same period last year with residential revenue growth of 8.3%.","Our fourth quarter revenue growth accelerated both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. And finally, adjusted EBITDA grew by 10.5% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the growth potential of our operating strategy and early 2015 results will demonstrate Charter's free cash flow potential. As we move into the second half of 2015, we'll start the same process that we started here at Charter in 2012 on a new set of acquired assets with more scale and an enhanced footprint. As we start 2015, we remain focused on 3 key areas: execution of our market share growth strategy through quality operations and service; continued improvements to our product offering; and closing and integrating our transactions with Comcast.","Starting with our core strategy, Charter Spectrum is gaining momentum in the market with over 80% of our residential customers now receiving Spectrum products and all-digital behind us. Our sales, marketing and customer care and field operations will focus on driving additional customer growth and product penetration. Our expectation is that Charter Systems today will grow customers across each of our product lines in 2015, including video. We also remain focused on improving our service levels, better service starts with highly valued products at competitive prices that work well and to extend making Charter a convenient service provider. Over the last 3 years, we've developed an in-source service infrastructure by investing in our own people and our own IT and network platforms, much of which historically was outsourced at Charter. Those investments are already paying off with higher-quality transactions. And we already have or will shortly relaunch many of our internal and customer-facing platforms.","We also have a strong pipeline of new products and services. Spectrum Guide, our new cloud-based user interface, has been tested and will be deployed at scale. The new guide makes content search and discovery easier and fully enables our on-demand offering. And because it's cloud-based, the guide can be updated or refreshed at any time at low cost. What makes Spectrum Guide unique is that it can function on all of our 11 million deployed set-top boxes, regardless of their age or processing power. And with the completion of all-digital, we can deliver Spectrum Guide to all TV sets without service transactions or significant capital. Our goal is to roll out Spectrum Guide to over half our retained footprint or over 1.5 million video customers in 2015. Ultimately, whether you are viewing our video product on a set-top box, a mobile device via our TV app or on a desktop via our new customer portal, our video product navigation will have a consistent, uniform look and feel.","In early January, we announced the introduction of our downloadable security solution on our new World Box. This smaller, more capable box can be sourced from multiple vendors and is interoperable with all of our legacy video platforms. World Box has a DOCSIS 3.0 modem, high-powered USB port, more processing power and DVR storage, an RF-capable remote, and interestingly, a lower cost. And it provides us more flexibility as our network and services evolve in both our retained and acquired footprints. We'll also launch WiFi hotspots for our residential customers at commercial business customer locations in 2015 and more broadly over time.","In the business telecom space, we recently divided our commercial service group into 2 groups, Spectrum business, which serves small- and medium-sized businesses; and Spectrum Enterprise, which serves large businesses and carrier customers. In the coming months, we will launch our new product and pricing packaging to the small and medium business segment to further accelerate market share growth. The entire business telecom market in our footprint remains a major growth opportunity for Charter and will be even greater when we close on the transaction with Comcast.","Which brings us to our third key objective in 2015, closing and integrating our transaction with Comcast. We're making good progress on the regulatory front, and we have the necessary financing for the TWC portion of the transaction. We will close the transaction after Comcast closes its deal with TWC and once the spin-off financing for GreatLand is complete. Our transition and integration planning with Comcast and TWC is also progressing well, and we look forward to closing our part of the transactions in the second quarter.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 7 of today's presentation. We grew residential PSUs by 157,000 during the fourth quarter, and we added 3,000 residential video customers. That includes approximately 5,000 bulk digital upgrades.","In Residential Internet, we added 104,000 customers, and we grew residential voice customers by 50,000. As Tom mentioned, our residential customer base has now grown by 280,000 or 5% in the past year. And at the same time, fourth quarter residential ARPU rose by 3.1% year-over-year, driven by higher-product sell-in and increase to our retrans pass-through in September, partially offset by the continued sell-in of single-play Internet and a larger digital bulk upgrade base.","As Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 8.3%. Even without the benefit of the September retrans rate adjustment, residential revenue grew by 7.3%. That accelerated year-over-year and sequentially. Looking at commercial, we added 14,000 PSUs. Commercial revenue grew by 16% driven primarily by small and medium businesses. Excluding the lower growth hospitality video base, business telecom revenue grew by 19%.","As Tom mentioned, we have a large, underpenetrated business telecoms market opportunity in the Charter footprint today, and we've recently made some go-to-market changes in advance of closing the transactions to better take advantage of what we believe is a long runway for growth and a larger pro forma footprint. Our advertising business also had a strong quarter growing 29% year-over-year. While fourth quarter political played a big part, advertising revenue growth, excluding political, remained strong, roughly 9% year-over-year and 5% for the full year. In total, revenue was up by 9.9% in Q4 versus last year. And excluding the impact of political and the higher retrans pass-through, total revenue still grew by 8.3%.","Turning to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. Total operating expenses grew by $131 million or 9.6% year-over-year. Note that transition cost related to our transactions with Comcast were included in that number and accounted for about $11 million of the $131 million. And that expense is captured in cost-to-service customers and other operating costs. Total programming expense grew by $64 million, accounting for about half the increase in total operating expense versus Q4 '13. The 11.6% increase in programming was driven by contractual rate increases, 1.9% growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year and higher penetration of our tiers, broader carriage and the launch of new channels like the SEC channel. Cost-to-service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, and network operations costs, grew by about 7% year-over-year on higher customer and revenue growth.","Other costs grew by $37 million or 20% year-over-year, driven by higher labor costs to support commercial and the in-sourcing of IT, engineering and product functions, also some additional administrative and advertising labor expense and transition cost related to the transactions. So in total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $81 million or 10.5% year-over-year and 8.2% for the full year.","I'm not going to get into a detailed line-by-line waterfall, but if you exclude the fourth quarter impact of political advertising revenue and exclude M&A transition expenses, our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA still grew by about 10%. If you were to further exclude the Q4 effects of the retrans pass-through increase in September, which is in fact, a recurring benefit, EBITDA grew about 8%. So thinking about growth with a lower level of rate increase is more of a forward-looking comment, which I'll come back to in just a moment.","Moving to Slide 12, fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $543 million. About 1\/3 of that spend was driven by CPE. And of our total CapEx this quarter, only $42 million was directly attributable to our all-digital initiative with most of that spend inside CPE. For the full year, we spent $2.2 billion in total capital expenditure with about $400 million for all-digital in plan with previous estimates and including $27 million of transition capital relating to the pending transactions. We generated $89 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter compared to $84 million during the same period last year. So our higher year-over-year EBITDA and lower CapEx in the fourth quarter was mostly offset by the transaction and transition cost for our deal with Comcast. That includes $52 million of higher cash interest for the $7 billion of escrow debt financing. So we're incentivized to close on the transaction with Comcast, not only to get going, but to gain access to the operating cash flow associated with the interest payments and the transaction costs.","As a reminder, our weighted average borrowing cost is 5.6% today and 5.4% pro forma for the transactions. And our current leverage ratio is 4.4x on an LTM basis. We also had a big quarter for warrant exercises for $79 million of proceeds in the quarter for the cash settlement portion. And as you can see on Slide 22, we no longer have any warrants outstanding.","Of course, as Slide 14 shows, we continue to benefit from our outsized tax basis and NOLs from a free cash flow perspective. Our total tax basis at year end was $9.1 billion, and our NOL is now $9.5 billion. And we don't expect to be a significant cash taxpayer until at least after 2020.","So all in all, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, and we're well positioned for 2015. Our systems are poised for continued market share, revenue and EBITDA growth without having to take significant price increases, despite the obvious programming headwinds. While annual rate increases have not been the primary driver of revenue -- for growth for us, in Q1 of this year, we're taking an even smaller rate increase than prior years. That may appear to slow our short-term year-over-year growth rate, at least relative to this past quarter, but our goal is to grow market share now with superior products while competitors take larger rate increases. We also want to minimize customer disruption in the face of closing and integrating a complicated set of M&A transactions with Comcast and the teams at TWC in GreatLand. Absent the transactions with Comcast, we expect to spend approximately $1.7 billion of capital expenditure in 2015. That's a full $500 million less than 2014, which falls straight to free cash flow. That estimate still includes ongoing expenditure to continue in-sourcing our labor force with the purchase of facilities, trucks, tools and test equipment, in-sourcing IT and network platforms to provide better end-to-end service and accelerate our time-to-market and to fund new product development in the areas Tom mentioned, like downloadable security and the Spectrum Guide rollouts. The $1.7 billion also includes our assumption for continued customer growth.","As we get closer to closing, we'll continue to have onetime operating and capital expenditures to prepare the company to double the number of customers we serve. That type of expenditure will continue for a period after close, as well as transition service cost going both ways between us and Comcast as we migrate customers off each other's platforms. So it'll be noisy, but as we have during the past 2 quarters, we intend to continue to highlight this transition cost -- transaction cost and escrow interest to provide visibility to the underlying results, including free cash flow. So we provided significant color on how we think our underlying financial trends will develop post-closing both on previous calls and our S-4 filings, so I won't repeat that here other than to say that we're confident in the operating strategy, our ability to integrate the new assets well and how that translates into a long-term growth strategy, which translates into free cash flow.","With that, I'll hand it back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.","Vijay A. Jayant - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Tom, I just want to understand with this transition that you have to do with the Time Warner Cable properties, can you sort of compare and contrast what -- since you've already done that on the heritage Charter properties, what the real challenges are? What the properties? How different are they in terms of pricing promotion and just the operational structure? Obviously, it probably seems to be an easier transition than you had.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, Vijay, I think that there are many things that are similar in the transition in terms of product strategy and pricing strategy that we'll want to implement. But these assets are in different shape relative to what Charter was in 3 years ago in terms of the maintenance that's been done on the plant has been better. The trucks, tools, test equipment and the employee base is better. And so the amount of total investment should be lower, although we haven't done the deal. We haven't gotten in and started to formulate a detailed plan. But our CPE strategy, which we developed will allow us to have a lower cost of capital to do the kind of product development that we've done at Charter. And so net-net, I think it's more complex from a transition services perspective. We're going to be taking new assets in and having to migrate them off Time Warner and Comcast platforms. That's actually quite complicated. The business has become much more cloud-based or national. So the email systems, the billing systems, the provisioning systems, those are all national kind of infrastructures that each company has that are unique. And the same will be reciprocated in our assets going to Comcast. There's a complex transition process that we've been working through with Comcast, and we have the transition services agreement developed. So we have that to deal with, but in terms of the assets themselves and integrating them and making them work the way we want from a product perspective. We think they're better than what Charter was 3 years ago.","Vijay A. Jayant - Evercore ISI, Research Division","If I can just have a quick follow-up, obviously, it looks like Title II will rate for variance [ph] is probably going to happen in some form. Does anything change in your pricing investment or M&A strategy just broadly?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I mean the issue with Title II is that as it's currently described, it doesn't look like it changes anything. Our concern is that it increases the power of a regulatory body in an unnecessary way. We've had a very successful experience in putting private capital to work and developing high-speed Internet service. And as you see, what we've done over the last 3 years, we've quadrupled the speed of our average Internet service. And it seems to me to be an excessive approach, but it -- and so we're opposed to it, but it does look like it's going to be, in fact, the law of the land.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess kind of a similar question. What are your thoughts on this new definition of broadband? Do you think that that's going to have any impact on the regulatory environment? Anything that you can comment on there.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I'd say this, we have -- we've never had a problem actually with net neutrality. That is the business model that we operate in and have operated in. To my knowledge, no ISP. I've never been asked to prioritize content by any website. So I've never actually had a personal business experience where net neutrality was an issue. And so I didn't think previously that we even needed net neutrality regulation, but because it was our business model and because it was essentially not a problem, I signed up for the light touch net neutrality regulation previously. And I think it was working just fine. It got overturned by the courts, but I think we have a heavy-handed regulatory solution for a problem that doesn't exist. And while it doesn't change the status quo in any way, it's -- somebody has a bazooka aimed at you, and that's an uncomfortable situation.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, you talked about the sort of volume versus price strategy for quite a while, and it's working out well. I'm just curious, given the pretty substantial price increases from your competitors, call it, 5% and roughly 10% increase in programming cost, does it not make sense to take a decent price increase? And can you expand on that? And then also, does that mean that margins on a stand-alone basis drag a little bit this year?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we've actually taken a moderate price increase, a very moderate price increase. And we think that we can continue to grow our market share faster than we would otherwise by taking a larger increase. But in the long run, pricing power comes from having superior products. And our strategy is to put superior products in front of customers, have them recognize that they're superior and to have a long-term relationship with that customer and to the extent that the customer perceives us as more valuable, ultimately, we can get the price. And so how and when you take it is a part of the marketing strategy.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And can you expand a little bit on what the, you said moderate, what those price increases have been?","Thomas M. Rutledge","The rate increase part of our price strategy has been less than 2% the last couple of years. And it's going to be even less than that going forward. So most of our rate growth is coming from subscriber growth; and secondly, by selling more valuable products incrementally.","Christopher L. Winfrey","So Phil, the impact of what I was describing is that if you take a lower amount of rate increase in the first quarter of this year, which we have for the reasons that we described versus a higher level of what was done last year, it has the effect of artificially and temporarily impacting the year-over-year growth rate. But it's done so in a way that's designed to increase your longer-term revenue and EBITDA growth rate and your margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","I wonder if I could go back to this -- the Title II question for a second. In the event that the -- well, first, do you think that the Title II developments yesterday have any bearing on the review of the transactions that you and Comcast have in front of the SEC and DOJ right now? And then second, if that deal is blocked for any reason, does Title II affect your appetite for further expansion in the category at all?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we haven't seen the order, Craig. So I only know what is in blogs, and we would rather not have Title II than have it. There's going to be -- it appears to be a long period of litigation and uncertainty about what the actual rules are. And we're going to have to operate during that period of uncertainty. I don't know how it affects the transaction. I haven't heard directly from a regulator about the transaction or their point of view about the transaction. So I don't -- I really don't know what its impact would be. And we, as a company, are interested in acquisitions because we strongly believe that the cable business, as we see it, is a good business and that it has potential for growth that the assets that we manage are superior assets and that we can compete. And so any platform out there that's available that would allow us to take advantage of scale and unsold passings is attractive to us at the right price. So if Time Warner were to fall under that position again, obviously, we'd be interested, but there's a lot of ifs there. And all of our energy and expectation is that the deal will close. And that's what we're working on, and that's what we're doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.","Your next question will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies.","Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Tom, maybe just a quick comment. I know AT&T has sort of pulled back on the U-verse front a bit. Maybe just comment on the competitive landscape from a pricing standpoint, and then maybe just a quick comment on the AT&T stuff. And then, I guess not to get too detailed, but you talked about progress on the regulatory front in the prepared remarks. Just trying to get a sense for what you sort of meant by that?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, on the regulatory front, all of the -- most of the, if not all the LFAs have approved the transactions that we're doing. So the vast majority are approved. That's been logistically complex. We've been working on that, and it's pretty much done. And the FCC Shot Clock is moving along. And they've asked for information, and we've provided all the information requested by DOJ and by FCC. And as I've just said to Craig, I don't have any direct feedback, positive or negative, from federal regulatory authorities.","Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And Tom, just on that front, would you -- if there's a process by which the FCC is negotiating conditions with Comcast, is that something that Charter would be involved with from the start?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I don't know how the FCC will choose to negotiate with us. But we have been included so far in all the discussions.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions for either of you guys, maybe first on commercial. That growth has slowed a bit. I'm wondering if you think that's going to accelerate going forward and how the Time Warner Cable deal might impact that. And I think you mentioned some new pricing and packaging. So any color on how you're going to attack small business going forward would be helpful. And then maybe for Chris on the outlook, you put in this broadcast fee increase in the fourth quarter, which obviously will ripple through '15. I know you're raising rates less in Q1 '15 than the prior year. I guess I'm just trying to understand, if we step back from the kind of quarterly movements, are you suggesting that for '15, you'll have less benefit of ARPU growth than '14? Or are you focusing us more on just Q1?","Christopher L. Winfrey","The answer to that question is yes. We'll have less benefit in '15 of flow-through rate increase from annualized rate increases, whether you include that retrans pass-through or not.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Ratcliffe...","Thomas M. Rutledge","Wait a minute.","Christopher L. Winfrey","We had one other point that Ben wanted...","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, Ben wanted me to answer the question about commercial. Yes, it has slowed sequentially and part of that is due to the cell tower business, which we have had a successful run with but has slowed. And yes, we think that new product and pricing can accelerate small business growth, which is the biggest piece of that business today. And similarly to our residential strategy, we think that having superior properly priced products in the small business space, well marketed from a value proposition perspective can accelerate growth. And so that's part of our operating strategy there. And then with regard to the transaction, we're going to have a much better footprint going forward for commercial service marketing and operations because we'll have a better DMA coverage proposition than we currently do. And as a result of that, we think that we can accelerate growth in our -- this is over the long term, in our commercial space and stand up better products and compete more effectively.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham.","James Maxwell Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two, if I could. First of all, following up on the question regarding 25 megabit service. I know you have a de minimis FiOS overlap, but do you have a read on what share of your footprint has a telco offering of 25 megs or more available? And second, on the M&A front, clearly, you're interested in doing things beyond the TWC-Comcast transaction. But how do we think about the sequencing of that? Do you have to get Comcast-TWC done before you can work on other opportunities? Or can they all happen in parallel?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'm not sure what the 25 megabit footprint is going forward relatively. Today, U-verse's average customer is 6, and ours is 60-plus. And FiOS overlap with us is less than 4%. So -- but what I don't know is how much of U-verse is capable of 25 megabits inside our footprint. But from a practical point of view today, we are dramatically different than they are. Maybe our marketing strategy should be to say, AT&T doesn't sell broadband, but we haven't decided to do that. What was...","Christopher L. Winfrey","James, the second part of your question was...","James Maxwell Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","On M&A, whether other opportunities need to wait for completing the Comcast-TWC transaction? Or if you can work on them in parallel?","Thomas M. Rutledge","We're good at multitasking, but we take our M&A opportunities when they arise.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On your Spectrum Guide, you made a significant investment there. How confident are you on how transferable that will be to customers in the properties, post the Comcast transaction? And then on the -- additionally, on the transaction, are you still fielding active calls and inquiries from DOJ? Or is it -- are you mostly done with that and it's pretty much the FCC inquiries at this point?","Thomas M. Rutledge","The last part of your question, DOJ inquiry is still going on. And with regard to our user interface, the whole purpose of that user interface is to be able to make it work on additional assets without having to change those assets out, meaning all the existing boxes in the Time Warner footprint would be capable -- all the existing two-way boxes in both the Time Warner and Comcast footprints would be capable of using that user interface. It is not capable of being put on to a D-to-A, which is very inexpensive one-way product that exists in both Time Warner and Comcast. But generally, the answer to your question is yes, it can be done quite easily.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. The first is, from a Title II perspective, if the FCC was to put that into the consent decree, is that something that would make you reconsider the M&A trend line and what you plan to do in that market? And the second component of...","Thomas M. Rutledge","[indiscernible] Go ahead, sorry, the second question.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the second question was more in terms of the competitive landscape. I mean DirecTV and DISH have basically been saying that they're managing their customer base for -- more for cash. And they're letting go of the low-credit-quality customers and so on. So when you -- given that you overlap with the satellite operators significantly, in terms of the quality of customers that you're getting and the churn rates and so on, have you seen any trends which could help us in terms of what the new subscriber base looks like versus what you had historically?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, on the first part of your question on Title II, I answered that previously. We haven't seen the order. If it's the status quo, that's one thing; if it's -- and obviously, it's going to -- it's creating confusion and uncertainty. And we'll have to deal with that. With regard to the quality of customers, look, we think that we're a superior service to satellite, and our whole investment thesis has been to turn our two-way platform, to turn our video product into something that can't be replicated by satellite and to take their customers away from them. And we are growing our business. We've got a long way to go. Satellite -- we successfully took cable customers for 20 years and got to 35% penetration. I think there's an opportunity for us to grow our business at their expense slowly. And I think that their highest-quality customers would be best served by our superior products. But we're interested in all customers, and we think we can serve all customers effectively.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisors.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Tom, you mentioned last quarter that there may be some benefit of packages that are smaller and at a lower price. What have you seen regarding your customers, regarding their price elasticity? And how many cable networks do you think that you guys could drop without lifting subs?","Thomas M. Rutledge","That's a good question. Price elasticity is a problem. The biggest problem in video is that it costs too much, and there's been a lot of price pressure because of the programmers' ability to pass through pricing in the bundle. And selling a more tailored product that was compelling would be a very attractive thing. The problem is that last concept of compelling. Do you have enough to make it worthwhile? And we haven't been able to put a package, a small package together yet that would cost less and still satisfy what most people want out of television. So that's a real dilemma. And we would be interested in developing it. We are working with programmers where we can to do it. And you've seen the sling product. I'm not sure that alone, as it's currently defined, is a breakthrough product. But it's certainly possible to imagine a much more tailored product environment where customers would be satisfied and would be able to afford the product. But that has major implications to the video business ecosystem.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you, all, for joining.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Charter Communications Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Gutzler. Ma'am, you may begin.","Robin Gutzler","Thank you, Keisha. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Charter's 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call, however, we encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma results for 2011. Pro forma results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011, unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thank you, Robin. In the third quarter, we made solid progress in implementing our key strategic changes, and our overall results are in line with our expectations.","We grew residential customer relationships by 19,000 during the quarter compared to a loss the last several years, increased primary subscriber units by 48,000 and we generated 3.75% revenue growth. As expected, EBITDA was impacted by the transition to our new operating strategies. Our adjusted EBITDA was effectively flat year-over-year.","We also accelerated capital investment to $488 million in the quarter, reflecting the significant growth opportunity in front of us and the need to create an initial working inventory of CPE.","Before we go further into details about our financial results for the quarter, I'd like to give you an update on how we're changing the way we do business. My goal is to generate more cash flow per home passed and long-term shareholder returns. I started in February, and I'm confident that Charter has all the necessary pieces in place, but we're making some changes to the operating model.","We've revamped our product, changed our offer structure and changed our selling structure, we're going all digital, and to offer a competitive product with clean bandwidth and secure our plan. And we're reorganizing our operations, including the bulk of operating responsibilities at Charter, all of which is intended to give a clear line of ownership, authority and accountability for every aspect of the customer experience.","For example, by centralizing network operations, we'll be able to centrally manage our infrastructure, allowing us to move more quickly to implement product changes uniformly across the network and maintain consistent service quality. We now have a centralized marketing and sales organization clearly focused on bringing in long-term and profitable new customers.","Our regional teams will focus on operations, including installation, service, maintaining quality outside plant and they'll focus exclusively on doing these critical responsibilities well. These are just some of the examples of recent changes, and they will take time to fully implement and have the intended effect. But we have the team in place to do it, and we're making meaningful headway.","We've also launched new pricing and packaging as we entered the third quarter. We simplified and standardized our offering for both our customers and sales agents.","In video, we made the product competitive by increasing our HD offering and provided the right box and the right TV set in each transaction. We also simplified our Internet offering in 2 tiers and increased our base Internet speed to 30 megabits, which is 10x faster than the typical DSL speed and faster than U-verse can currently go.","We priced our lead triple play offer, which includes a fully featured phone offering in a way that includes more value than our customers can get elsewhere. In addition, we changed how we go to market with this superior offering by modifying our channel mix and messaging and changing our sales compensation plans to drive the desired selling activities.","The key objectives of our new offering are to: one, drive deeper penetration of our services into the home with a simple compelling offer structure; secondly, to drive higher ARPU per connect which will increase over time with built-in, multi-year price dips; third, our transaction cost per customer will be lowered; and finally, we'll extend the life of our customers through lower churn. All of these objectives are designed to increase operating cash flow and drive return on investment.","At this point, we're where we expected to be, and I'm pleased with some of the early stats. For example, we've seen our triple play percentage of new connects increase by 70%. And as of the end of the quarter, 17% of our base is now on our new pricing and packaging, which in a single quarter is ahead of where we expected to be.","Through a new customer acquisition and migration of legacy customers, we're seeding the market with a better video product, with an upfront capital investment which pays for itself immediately or after a promotional period. That improvement in video doesn't immediately show when you only look at growth -- video growth in the third quarter. Our expanded basic subscriber losses actually improved by 30,000 year-over-year because we're only actively marketing expanded basic.","We lost 17,000 expanded basic customers in Q3 '12 versus losing 47,000 in the same quarter last year. We've added a graph on Slide 4 of the presentation posted this morning which shows how previous selling -- reception basic masks the underlying improvement.","While the big opportunity for Charter remains in our core operations, our offerings and the service we provide, we continue to develop new products in parallel. That includes delivering content on devices inside and outside the home; in proving user interfaces, both on legacy and on new devices; in creating the capabilities to control and modify and deliver those interfaces from the cloud. We'll have more to announce on product developments as they're ready for broader rollout.","We're developing those product improvements in the context of buying set-top boxes at significantly lower prices which we can use to grow Charter. And we intend to progressively move to an all-digital platform over the next 2 years, starting with seeding with boxes -- the market with boxes today, turning off analog channels to reclaim bandwidth and eventually switching off the inferior analog product altogether.","So we're making improvements across the organization and changing the way we do business. There is a lot of change, and I'm pleased with the way our employees have responded. Ultimately, we'll be a highly effective service organization with a superior product offering. And we're taking actions designed to deliver meaningful value to customers and superior return on investment to our shareholders.","And before I turn the call over to Chris to cover the third quarter in more detail, I'd like to highlight that our commercial services continue to do well, grew revenue by more than 20% year-on-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, demonstrating strength in this business. We continue to see a big opportunity in front of us here.","And now, Chris Winfrey?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are tracking with the strategy Tom just laid out. Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly, and CapEx increased as a function of the plans we're implementing.","Looking at residential volume and revenue per customer on Slide 4. The customer relationships increased 19,000 compared to a loss of 10,000 in Q3 of 2011. In PSU terms, we grew by 48,000 in the third quarter compared to virtually 0 a year ago. Our video losses were 10,000 higher than prior year. Our expanded basic trend improved, with limited basic customers representing over 3 quarters of the decline this year compared to 25% in the prior year.","We added 69,000 Internet customers compared to 53,000 last year. And phone PSUs, the most visible beneficiary of our new pricing packaging, increased by 52,000 in Q3, nearly 5x the gain of 11,000 in the year-ago quarter, all of which was expected given the changes we're making.","Total revenue per residential customer relationship was $105.39 in the quarter, down from Q2 ARPU of $106. The overall ARPU reflected entry-level pricing; and despite a meaningful increase in triple play selling, still reflects continued sales of single play Internet.","So those are the early statistics, but there's more to the numbers. We no longer actively market analog, and we also saw a temporary drop in direct sales as we retool that channel. We acquired customers who are more profitable, with a deeper product and CPE penetration which will lower future transaction cost and propensity to churn.","Triple play increased by 70% to 26% of new connects in Q3 at an entry-level ARPU of approximately $120 and removed a portion of our existing base up the value chain to make existing relationships more profitable.","So the revenue benefit is not yet in the financials and won't be for a few quarters. What we do expect to highlight in the coming quarters are ARPU per residential customer, not product ARPU, and the percentage customers taking bundled products, particularly triple play; and early on, the portion of our customer base in the new pricing and packaging with a richer, fuller offering, which will result in fewer transactions and lower churn. As Tom mentioned already, it's 17% of our base.","Turning to Slide 5 in the presentation. Third quarter revenue grew 3.7% year-on-year. Video revenues declined 0.5% due to a decrease in residential basic video customers year-on-year, partially offset by price increases and higher DVR and HD revenues. Internet revenues were 7.6%, driven by the addition of more than 300,000 customers over the past year.","And phone revenues were down 3.7%, despite the 6.5% customer gain in the past 12 months, somewhat irrelevant going forward due to triple play revenue allocation, which is why we'll stop reporting product ARPUs after Q4 and while we're providing some additional color on bundling splits. And don't forget, we're selling in at promotional rates today with lower onetime fees, including install with the new pricing and packaging.","Adjusted EBITDA was down $3 million year-over-year. But before I go through the expense drivers, I want to tie the PSU and revenue development to our growth investments.","As shown on Slide 6, third quarter capital expenditures totaled $488 million, an increase of $184 million versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher CPE, support capital and commercial spend. We spent over 1\/2 our capital, or $255 million, on CPE in the quarter, essentially split into 4 buckets of spend. Nearly 40% of the spend in the CPE category during Q3 was to capitalize new install labor for residential and commercial, which is included in the MCTA-CPE category. We also built CPE inventory, which accounted for approximately 30% of the $255 million to ensure adequate stocking levels to execute on our new strategies. We can think of these dollars as really onetime working capital and timing.","We also invested in CPE for new customer acquisition and upgrades to existing customers, and this accounted for roughly 15% of the quarterly CPE spent. And finally, we're installing more CPE into our existing video customers' homes as they migrate to our new pricing and packaging and take a richer video product from us, which accounted for the remaining roughly 15% of the CPE expenditure.","So the link I'm really trying to make here is to show why that current CPE spend isn't immediately flowing to revenue. All of the CPE spend in each type of box deployment has a clear ROI attached to it, even at promotional rates. And I'm confident you'll see that spend flow through the revenue and cash flow. I'm going to show you that development over time.","To round our capital expenditures in addition to higher CPE, we increased capital to grow commercial, reflected primarily in scalable infrastructure on line extensions in our CapEx categories, and we increased commercial to $82 million in the third quarter or $34 million more than last year. And support capital expenditure also increased due to fleet replacement, which is primarily timing-related.","Our current estimate for 2012 CapEx is $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. We expect to be on a different part of the investment curve than our peers for the next few years, but we think our growth can be more efficient given significant reductions in CPE pricing.","Now back to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.5% year-on-year as revenue growth of 3.7% was offset by increased expenses. Total operating costs increased 6%, and the key cost drivers were programming, which was $27 million or 5.7%; and we increased labor cost for preventive maintenance to identify potential failure points in advance and improve customer service.","And while we expect marketing, reconnect and preventive maintenance to continue at elevated levels for some time, this is all discretionary spend; and it's designed to drive revenue, better service, improve retention and ultimately, higher cash flow for home passed.","So our collective investments, including capital expenditure, are shown on Slide 8, where free cash flow was negative $17 million in Q3. From a balance sheet perspective, we had $715 million of liquidity at September 30 in pro forma for announced transactions. And during the quarter, we continue to be active in the debt markets, balancing our maturity profile and bringing down our weighted average cost of interest.","In the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of 5.25% senior unsecured notes in August, and we announced a redemption of $678 million of CCH II 13.5% notes, which we completed on October 10. We've initiated the call for the remaining $468 million outstanding in November.","Pro forma for retiring those 13.5% notes, our weighted average interest rate will be 5.9%, our cash interest run rate will be just under $770 million, down some $175 million from just the third quarter of 2011.","So most of the heavy lifting on the capital structure is complete, but we'll continue to be opportunistic in extending and balancing our maturity profiles as opportunities arise. We ended the quarter with pro forma leverage of 4.8x, which is above our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5x. As I've said before, we can be plus or minus a half turn either way, to be opportunistic as we were with buybacks last year which enables strategic activity, including the current investment levels to position Charter for growth. I'm very comfortable with our current leverage, liquidity and our maturity profiles.","And now, back to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Chris. So in closing, we're pleased with our progress in the results at this stage of implementation. There's more work to be done, but we're energized by the opportunity to drive long-term growth at Charter.","Operator, let's open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On CapEx, I think the market is sort of aware of the guidance, the $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. But I think that some of the commentary you gave today may have been new to the market, sort of higher CapEx, I think you said over the next few years. And I was just wondering if you could add a little bit of color, because Charter's sort of CapEx to rev ratio has always run sort of a bit above peers. So I don't know if you're talking sort of absolute levels or sort of changes as a percent of revenue relative to where we are in 2012.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Jason, we didn't hear the beginning of your question, but I think...","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, yes, just on CapEx. So I think the guidance, everyone's aware of the $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. But I thought it was new when you said that capital intensity maybe on I think you said a different trajectory over the next few years. I was just wondering if you could add some color to that.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes. Look, I think the point we're trying to make is that we're elevated today, and we expect to be elevated for some period of time. And that really reflects the growth opportunities that exist at Charter and the fact that we'll be going all digital over the next 2 years, so it's a part of the CPE spend. And the good news is better CPE spend at a much lower price than where the market has historically bought those boxes. And so the capital spend that we have, we expect to be more efficient. But if you just take a look at the third quarter spend and even on the second quarter spend, you can see the uplift in CPE. And what we're trying to do today is provide a little bit of color on that for what is actually deploying to labor that flows into CPE for MCTA categories. And importantly, what's actually driving new acquisition and migrations, which is the 15% and the 15%, respectively. And onetime inventory buildup that I've talked about both on Q2 as well as in Q3. And we think we're comfortable now in just talking about what to be able to position the company to deploy the boxes, the box strategy that we have.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the right way to think about it is the more successful you are on the top line hitting your objectives, sort of the longer elevated CapEx will endure that sort of take hold?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, that's right. In terms of comparing to peers, it's also a growth story as well. Charter's underpenetrated, has a bigger growth opportunity. And most of the capital is actually success-based, variable capital. And so you're right. To the extent that our growth exceeds our peers, our capital will exceed our peers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Tom, back when you were at Cablevision, you used to talk a lot about the long-term capital intensity of cable. And I think you talked about the prospect that capital intensity could, for that system, get below 10%. How do you think about long-term capital intensity at Charter? You got more head-ins and a more diffused geographic footprint. Do you have a long-term vision for where you think capital intensity can get to?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. And I do think that in general, the cable business becomes more capital-efficient through time. It does not require another plant upgrade, which was always a concern in the industry in terms of capital intensity, and as obviously as digital set-top boxes and CPE in general continue to come down in price. And we have a strategy of buying CPE from world-class vendors and trying to get our CPE in a position where we can buy them, buy CPE from multiple providers, and therefore, get competitive pricing. And because of general price trends in general on electronics, the ability to continue to upgrade the cable system electronically and take its capacity up becomes less capital-intensive through time. The big capital dollars on this business were for the erection of the physical plant. And so as our business changes, as it moves toward IP, we can take our business and change our business in a continuously improving sort of capital-intensity profile. And that's where you are in the curve in terms of how penetrated you are, and how much growth you have will affect your capital intensity for variable capital. But the fundamentals of the business are continuing to improve from a total capital-intensity perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to stay on the theme of capital expenditures and capital intensity. On the one hand, it sounds like you're spending more on CPE for some of the initiatives you've talked about. But at the same time, it sounds like you're saying that you may be able to save on CPE on a per-unit basis, partly perhaps because of more competition at the equipment provider level. But it also sounds like you may be implying thinner boxes in the home, boxes that may be won't have storage, et cetera, which would imply perhaps remote storage DVRs and other functionality in the cloud. I guess my question is, what gives you confidence that at this point or in the near future, you're network will be ready to provide a very robust service that could, without latency, et cetera, provide the kind of functionality into the home without a drive in the home that consumers would be pleased with?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Right. Well, I wouldn't say that we have an immediate capability at Charter to go to network DVR or other cloud-based services like it, which could take what is now a fairly expensive CPE and move it into a more efficient cloud-based delivery process. That said, we are already getting better pricing on our set-top boxes going forward. And there is an opportunity that ultimately get to a thinner environment, but also the price of the current thickness of boxes is coming down, so that the capital intensity for each dollar of revenue at this part of the curve is actually less than it was a few years ago. So that's already being realized, but you can see where it continues to improve. For instance, smart TVs or iPads with cable television on the iPad is a television and a set-top box embedded in the TV, the iPad itself. So there's a case where you can connect cable service, a fully featured cable product to an iPad, and there's no CPE provided by the cable company. The set-top box is part of the processing power of the device itself. And smart TVs have a similar capability. So as we move to a server-based architecture and serve IP devices like iPads and other tablets, smart TVs, the capital intensity of each one of those connections from a cable operator's perspective goes down. So we're on that part of the curve. And so our growth -- our revenue growth per set ought to be lower than those that have been realized over the past few years by both Charter and all the rest of the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Switching gears a little bit. Tom, can you talk about any interest in M&A as you sort of rebuild the core business? It seems like there's a lot going on in the company overall. Is there room for distractions like mergers or even property swaps at this point? Or is it something that sort of pushes off?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we're focused on our opportunity, and we have a big opportunity. And we have a lot of unsold passings with -- in front of us and a cable plant in front of them that's fully functional. So that's the big opportunity in Charter. And so we're not distracted by anything other than the opportunity in front of us.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if something were available? Is there a level of interest there?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, our level of interest would be related to the value of the opportunity in front of us. And we'd weigh that if in fact that became available.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Chris, I want to ask you 2 questions, one about ARPU and the other on just the CapEx accounting, if you could clarify for us. I think you mentioned ARPU per new triple play connect at $120, and ARPU per customer relationship was sort of flat year-on-year. I know there's a lot of moving pieces on ARPU right now. There were a couple of things you guys talked about last call like home networking, I think installation fees. Just if you could help -- kind of give us the puts and takes on ARPU in the quarter, and then how we sort of bridge from the current number to the kind of new connect number over time? And I just have a quick CapEx question. Is there any difference between cash and accrual capital as you build this inventory? In other words, how tied is the CapEx on a quarterly basis to what's actually happening from an installation perspective?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, so maybe I'll take the second one first. Under U.S. GAAP for cable companies, under the pronouncements that exist, capital -- what I would normally call working capital for inventory for CPE is capitalized up front. And so it does create a difference between how that capital was used and deployed versus how it's accounted for. And so the purpose of what I was doing in the prepared remarks today was to identify that portion, which is really a working capital item, which is building up your inventory and your supply chain in a way that you can deploy more boxes per transaction, because we did that in Q2 and Q3. In a normalized environment, the reason you wouldn't have heard too much about this in the past, is the normalized environment it's normally a bit of a wash, a little bit in one quarter and up the next. But in this environment where we're stocking the entire supply system to be able to deploy that many more boxes, it's relevant when you think about CPE. So there's onetime, and you'll see some fluctuations on it. I think we've got the large amounts of it behind us. Under IFRS or other accounting standards, that's not the case. And you would actually reflect CapEx as if it was deployed, and what I was describing with would be working capital. And that's why I kind of referred to it as working capital. On ARPU -- so that's the technical accounting of today. On ARPU, the waterfall is long, what you're trying to do. Some would avoid getting into all of that and try to keep it fairly simple. You have a few different levers that are taking place. One is that our triple play is year 1 promotional pricing, and it's coming in at an average of $120, which will step up over time, as will all of the different bundles that we're selling into today. So you have a promotional rate and you have a higher amount of sales going in at that higher-than-average ARPU today, albeit at a promotional rate for triple play. You have the lower amount of install at onetime fees. You have still a strong single play Internet sell-in that's taking place, and that forms part of the mix there as well. And net-net for all those puts and takes, even at promotional pricing, we're relatively flat year-over-year with a much improved customer base in terms of product set that they have and the position to be able to step up and rate over time. And so I think if we're able to do that despite the promotional rates and the fact that we're putting more triple play in and putting more boxes into the home, we're actually in a very good position both from a revenue standpoint, as well as an OpEx standpoint and from a capital efficiency through lower churn over time. That's without going line by line, that's really the right way to think about ARPU.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You've covered the CapEx questions, unfortunately, so I think I'll turn to competition and EBITDA margins. Tom, are you seeing anything notable from competitors at this stage, especially post implementing your expansive changes? And would something like faster U-verse speeds be a concern? For example, I imagine AT&T will make some noise Wednesday at their Analyst Day. And then I've got a question for Chris.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we haven't actually seen any change in the competitive environment. Cablevision has a pretty -- Charter has a footprint that has about 33% overlap with the competitive telco. So the vast majority of our footprint is competitive against satellite and DSL. And we're superior in almost our entire footprint. When we're up against FiOS, we have I'd say a comparable product. But when we're against AT&T in the U-verse area, we have a superior product. And when we're against satellite DSL, we have a superior product. Yes, if they take their speeds up, it will be a more competitive environment, but we have the ability to go much faster and farther than we've already gone with very little additional capital investment.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then for Chris, I know a lot of changes are taking place, but if operating execution is successful, it would seem Charter would shift from an initial investment phase or margins compressed to a faster growth phase where margins expand. So is that correct? Do you think -- do you see the potential for Charter to put up margin expansion at some point in the future? And at what point should investors start to model that in?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So I think the -- when you think about EBITDA margin, it's really -- the answer to your question would be when the growth starts to slow. The faster your grow, the more pressure there is on EBITDA margin as a percentage. You're spending more on sales and marketing, reconnect all the different areas that are driving that growth. And so while you're growing and particularly, when you're growing faster, you'll see compression on EBITDA margin. So I think not to turn the question back, but I will, which is when do you think the growth will slow? And that's when you see -- you should start to see margins return to a normal rate.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the philosophy is correct, but the hope is they don't grow for a long time, right?","Christopher L. Winfrey","That's right.","Thomas M. Rutledge","As long as you have an accelerating growth rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. So you're giving -- obviously putting more investment in the network. Can you frame it sort of in terms of historical cable? It seems like the -- the Street seems to believe that I've talked to investors, you're just a little bit stuck sort of a few years behind some of the peers. At what point can this CapEx push kind of put you on parity or put you ahead? And then specifically, to the commercial side, what are your thoughts on any needs for traditional maybe cloud-based products or so forth? Is that something you're looking to build or possibly see a tuck-in acquisition?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Tom, do you want to answer the commercial question first?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Sure, I'll answer the commercial side of that question. Regarding cloud-based services, we see plenty of opportunity with the base services we now offer to all segments. We are very underpenetrated in the business market. Now I believe a number of years out, as our penetration increases, we want to continue to grow at healthy rates that we will need some of the supplemental services. And we offer some of the basic cloud services today. But I think our current product portfolio is very adequate, given our penetration level and the opportunity ahead of us right now.","Christopher L. Winfrey","And with -- Frank, with regard to your question about capital in general and where we stand, as I was saying earlier, a lot -- most of our capital going forward is related to our opportunity to grow. And to the extent that we grow faster than other parts of the industry, we would have more capital relative to revenue than other companies that were growing less rapidly. That said, because Charter is historically underpenetrated based on its history and it has a big growth opportunity in front of it, to the extent that it achieves its growth objectives, each dollar of growth will be served with less capital than has already been invested previously by other companies because the curve in terms of cost per CPE unit continues to go down the price curve. And so we're getting both more advanced technology and lower prices in the kinds of CPE we're buying for the growth that we're presenting in front of us. And so in that sense, we're more capital efficient for dollar generated of revenue going forward than has historically been achieved in the industry. But to the extent we have more growth in the industry, we're going to have more capital.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so in terms of kind of when investors can see that you've kind of reached the endgame there, do you look at certain industry benchmark penetration levels or products? And when you get there, we should expect that to slowdown a little bit or where are you? Is it a 2-year gap relative to the industry, 18-month gap, 3-year gap, something like that?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, the best performing company in the industry generates about $450 of cash flow EBITDA for home passed, and Charter is the worst-performing company in the industry with about $225 of EBITDA per home passed. So that opportunity, $225, the doubling of our EBITDA in total would catch us up to the best-performing company in the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Looking at ARPU again, you said 17% of the subscriber base at the end of quarter was on the new package -- pricing package structure. How are they getting there? I mean, how many of those are customers who are new to the system and then basically they're coming onto the new plans versus existing customers for either proactively migrating or for retention being migrated? And how do we think about apples-to-apples what the pricing for an existing customer looks like if there's any step down on that or as you sort of move through the back book?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, I'm not sure I'm going to break out all of those pieces for you, but it's all of the above. We're acquiring new customers. We're migrating customers. But generally, our pricing strategy is to step up existing customers when they move into pricing packaging and not price them down and to price in news acquisition subscribers at higher prices than we historically sold them in at. We are modifying our installation prices, which are onetime charges, and they are reflected in some of the revenue growth and ARPU numbers that you see. But in terms of the monthly recurring price, except for a few exceptions, which are minor, relatively speaking, our objective is to price higher. Now the way we do that is add more value. The product is worth more. It has a lot more TV channels on the video product. They're in HD. There's 2-way interactivity as part of the service offering. The videos -- the data speeds have gone up dramatically to 30 megabits at minimum. And the voice feature -- the voice service is more fully featured than it was previously. So the full package is worth more, and we charge more for it.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. I actually have one other on advertising. I mean looking historically last presidential election, you sort of stepped up $6 million, $7 million 3Q to 4Q, more like $10 million in 2010. I mean how do we think about that this year both in terms of your relative exposure to targeted areas and also your improvement ability to actually capture the ad spend with more targeted cable ads?","Thomas M. Rutledge","We have a fairly undeveloped advertising infrastructure in terms of advanced features. When we have had a very good advertising year in terms of political advertising, and it's up dramatically as a result of political advertising. The future of Charter is such that we have a tremendous opportunity to create targeted advertising products. And I would say to date, we have hardly any of that in our revenue opportunity or in our actual produced revenue. So we're putting some capital, and this is not a very capital-intensive part of the business, into that capability and looking at trying to accelerate nonpolitical growth in advertising through the implementation of advanced services.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza.","Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","This is Shagun for Lance. I have a housekeeping question. Was there a timing shift in the payment of cash interest expense given the recent refinancing?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, and it was significant. The right way to think about this -- look, there's been multiple refinancing, so you can follow up with Robin after the call to go through maybe a waterfall on that because it's all publicly inside of the Q. But there have multiple refinancing. Each one of those have had different payment date terms. There is a significant difference, not only in effective rate that we have inside the quarter, but also in the timing of payments, all of which you can get off the maturity schedule that we had at each quarter. But the right way to think about this is what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that our interest expense is reduced dramatically, it's down into the 770  range or just below that. We can all swap cost [indiscernible] interest expense. And the interest rate is 5.9% now pro forma for the transactions. And then the schedule that you have inside of the presentation, if you look at the back of the presentation, you can actually map out how those payments will be taking place in the future.","Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'll look into it. The other question I had was regarding -- so on the phone and the Internet side, it looks like you're adding subscribers while sacrificing on price. Can you comment on that? And then finally, the last part of the question is on video. How much pricing did you take in the quarter? And how do you see the pricing environment going forward?","Thomas M. Rutledge","So we didn't have a video rate increase in the quarter. And product ARPU for phone, given that result being sold inside of a bundle, it's somewhat irrelevant. I mean, the reality is that it's had a discounted price to achieve a higher total ARPU on the sell-in. You can call it $0, which is not what we're doing, but just for the sake of argument. And that would be meaningless in terms of how you think about the revenue stream for the company. And so that's why we're focused on total product ARPU.","Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then how much pricing on the video side did you take in the quarter? Can you comment on that?","Christopher L. Winfrey","We did not take rate increases on video inside the quarter.","Robin Gutzler","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question is from Amy Yong.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","[indiscernible] video customer growth in the quarter, I think it grew on a sequential basis. I mean, how do you reconcile that with your bundling offers? I mean, is this just more high-speed data and phone net adds?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Amy, you got cut off at the very beginning of your question. We've been having those problems on this call. Can you just start with that question from the beginning which got chopped off?","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Yes. Can you just talk a little bit about the non-video customer growth in the quarter? I think it grew on a sequential basis. So how do you reconcile that against your bundling efforts?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I think that our bundling efforts are making the headway that we hope to at this time. Charter has an excellent data service and excellent reputation in the provision of data services. Last year, PC Magazine found us to be the fastest data service in the country. And so we continue to do really well in the marketplace with our data service, and it continues to work well. And our challenge with video is that we have not had a great video service, and we've reengineered the whole company in terms of its video product. And now we're in market with it, and it's beginning to, we think, resonate. And our performance year-over-year is better than it was, and we hope that it continues to get better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Given your new strategy, I'm sure there's certain cost that you're undertaking that are temporary in nature because of training and reshuffling the management structure and so forth. Is there any color you can give us, how much that is? And when can that sort of come off to get a better sense of margins going forward?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, I don't -- we've got a lot of activity in terms of the way we're organizing the company, and a lot of those things are in process. And I don't really want to forecast out numerous quarters into the future, but our business will normalize.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Vijay, to the point we were making earlier, the faster you grow, the more you have investment growth on the CapEx side, as well as on the OpEx side as well.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And given this new growth strategy, any color on return on capital now, given that you probably will have optimal CapEx and less free cash flow in the shorter term? Is that sort of a push forward too? I mean, is there a chance we could have return on capital in 2013 of any form?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Look, we're still -- for this year, we're still very much positive free cash flow. And we're at 4.8x, and we're very comfortable with that. The reason that we're at 4.8x really stems back to 2 things. One is that we've done significant buybacks all throughout the course of last year, but particularly towards the end of the year. And then the significant amount of refinancing activity that we had, which has premiums attached to it to be able to buy down our interest cost with attractive paybacks. And so those have been the real 2 drivers when you think about the leverage ratio. It's actually been less about CapEx spend because we've been producing positive free cash flow. So the way that we've always thought about return on capital is first and foremost, the investment opportunities that are inside the business because they tend to have the highest ROI. You can see that flowing through to this year when we've identified those opportunities and started to execute on those. And then over time, this leverage trends down and free cash flow ticks up. To the extent that's taking place and when, and you're into your target leverage range and you'll be looking at all those opportunities, whether it's buying your own stock or somebody else's through M&A, if you don't have a better use of capital, you get down to the bottom of your range or below, and you don't have pending opportunity to take a look at returning that cash to shareholders as well. So nothing has really changed on that front. We're just applying one of the ways that we can deploy capital today and investing inside the business.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Chris and Tom, I was wondering if you could shed a little light on the sequential increase in the line called All Other Operating Expense. Is that a temporary increase or is this a step up that will carry into subsequent periods? And also, do you think marketing cost now is at the right level? Or is that something that you should increase as you aim to grow units faster?","Thomas M. Rutledge","So on the other operating cost, we break out into SG&A and to operating expenses inside the MD&A. And you have seen inside that category includes programming, so that's the biggest driver. And then particularly labor and to drive some of the reconnect activities that we've been talking about both in a quarter and year-to-date basis. That includes internal and external labor. And then the preventive maintenance as well that we've highlighted. And that's probably the biggest driver year-over-year is the preventive maintenance outside of programming.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And with regard to marketing, we've stepped up our marketing, and we've actually reallocated our marketing. And the way we think about marketing dollars is if we can generate a higher response rate from more marketing, we do it and if that makes sense from an economic perspective. So we're right now marketing at the level which we think makes the most economic sense, given the response rate and our ability to handle the response rate and operate the business. But it's one of those things that if it works, and you have the ability to modulate your marketing in such a way that you can drive revenues successfully, then you spend what you need to spend to maximize your return. And that's our strategy. So we don't just turn it on and off with the hope that it works or doesn't, nor do we use it to make numbers in a particular quarter. We look at it as an investment tool and as a tool that generates response rates, that generate orders, that generate customers and rates of return and spend accordingly.","Robin Gutzler","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Please go ahead.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Charter's second quarter 2017 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com under the Financial Information session. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent proxy statement and Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call; however, we encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements.

Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Additionally, all customer and passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on Legacy company definitions. Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Stefan. In June, we finished the rollout of our new pricing, packaging and branding across our national footprint with the last launch of Spectrum in Hawaii. We now offer a simple straightforward high-value product using a consistent and uniform approach across our 50 million passings under one brand, Spectrum.","The new product is succeeding with consumers across our footprint. In the second quarter, our customers and PSU connects were higher year-over-year. And as of the end of the second quarter, 30% of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Legacy customers were in our new pricing and packaging, up from 17% at the end of last quarter. In areas where we've had Spectrum in place for at least three quarters, 43% of our residential customers have Spectrum package products.","Progression of product and package migration is virtually identical to what we saw at Legacy Charter. More of our customers are getting better products with better and consistent pricing, which will drive the higher customer satisfaction, lower churn, and greater value into our business. Today, nearly all of our video connects are purchasing our expanded basic video product, and expanded video customers grew in the second quarter.","Our Internet connects are getting faster minimum speeds. We're now offering minimum speeds of 100 megabits in over half of our footprint with minimum speeds of 60 megabits in the remaining footprint. We're also starting to see improvements in Legacy TWC disconnects with the base of customers in Legacy TWC pricing and packaging declining in size every month. And Time Warner Cable Legacy customer relationships grew by 3.5% year-over-year. Legacy Bright House and Legacy Charter also continue to perform well, especially when you consider that last year's second quarter benefited from dislocation at certain key competitors.","And Legacy Charter, we grew customer relationships by over 5% year-over-year, and at Legacy Bright House, we grew customer relationships by 6% when adjusting for seasonal program changes. Despite the transitional nature of our integration and our limited price increases this year, we grew total revenue by 4% in the quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA grew by over 8%. Our growth plan is on track and our financial results are better than where we were at the same point in time when we were reorganizing Legacy Charter.","In June, we restarted our all-digital project in the 40% of Time Warner Cable and 60% of Bright House that is not yet all-digital. We're early in that project, and most of our all-digital initiative will take place in 2018, but we're on schedule. In July, we completed the launch of new Spectrum pricing and packaging for the small and medium business segment. We're now offering simple, straightforward, fully featured and attractively priced SMB products in a consistent uniform approach nationwide, and our SMB strategy is intended to drive customer and market share growth. The growth opportunity in front of us is very large in both SMB and enterprise where we still have a low market share.","The integration of our field operations, customer operations and network operations is well underway and progressing as planned. Despite the complexity of changing product features, packaging and pricing, business rules, systems and training, we've been able to avoid customer disruption, and our in-sourcing efforts and service metric improvements are ahead of schedule.","Our wireless and product development efforts also continue to move forward. We intend to launch a wireless service in 2018 under our MVNO agreement with Verizon. And together with Comcast, we're working to find ways to cooperate in order to drive additional value for customers from our common wireless MVNO efforts.","We're also testing the capabilities of our network with 5G-like services. We've already received permission to test in a number of areas from the FCC and began some field trials just last week. We intend to use our trials to provide us with better insight into the capabilities of our robust broadband network architecture.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to provide more details on the quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. And I wanted to remind everyone that we aligned Bright House's seasonal customer program with Legacy Charter and Time Warner Cable. As a result, seasonal customers at Bright House now remain reported as customers throughout the year. That reduced the negative net additions impact we would have seen in the second quarter from customers activating a seasonal plan at Bright House. And it will reduce the positive net adds impact from seasonal customers returning to Florida in the winter when comparing to historicals. So, today, when I reference our second quarter 2017 results, I'll be comparing to second quarter 2016 results that have been adjusted to exclude the seasonal disconnect activity in 2016. We've provided that more meaningful year-over-year comparison on slide 6 of today's investor presentation.","Turning to our results, during the second quarter, total customer relationships grew by 1.1 million, or 4.2% year-over-year, with 3.5% at TWC, 5.3% at Legacy Charter, and 6% at Bright House, which reflects higher quality Legacy products and service relative to TWC and the impact of Charter's strategy on an already strong base. As Tom mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, 30% of TWC and Bright House customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging. That pricing and packaging continues to drive strong connect activity, with sales up year-over-year across the TWC footprint.","As slide 6 shows, we grew residential PSUs by 155,000 versus 340,000 last year, again, already adjusted for seasonal disconnects last year. The lower PSU net-adds were primarily driven by lower voice net-adds at Legacy TWC and lower Internet net-adds across all three Legacy entities. Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by 3.2%. Pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 0.4%, and Legacy Bright House lost 0.7% of its residential video customers, but continues to improve its year-over-year video results.","TWC's video net loss was 5,000 better than last year, with all of the net losses this quarter driven by churn from low value limited basic packages. Importantly, Legacy TWC's expanded basic video customer base grew significantly in the second quarter compared to a loss in last year's second quarter. The improvement in expanded video relationship net-adds in the second quarter from sell-in mix and migration was well over 200,000 year-over-year.","Similar to what we saw at Legacy Charter, after launching our new pricing and packaging, TWC video net gains should improve as the headwind of the limited basic churn declines as the limited basic base get smaller, and once we get a majority of the Legacy TWC base into Spectrum pricing and packaging.","Legacy Charter lost 10,000 video customers in the quarter versus a loss of 7,000 a year ago, and Bright House lost 12,000 video customers versus a loss of 20,000 last year. In total, we lost 90,000 residential video customers in a seasonally-weak quarter. That result was already 10,000 better than the prior year loss of 100,000, with this quarter's losses primarily driven by limited basic relationships at Legacy TWC.","In residential Internet, we added a total of 231,000 customers during the quarter versus 308,000 last year. Adjusted for the seasonal plan at Bright House was Legacy Charter declining from 90,000 in the second quarter of 2016 to 61,000 this quarter. As Tom mentioned, the year-over-year decline was in part related to the second quarter of 2016 Internet net-adds that benefited from challenges faced by competitors. And on the other hand, this year, we've admittedly been focused on putting 75% of our company's new footprint on to the Charter growth trajectory.","Over the last 12 months, we grew our total residential Internet customer base by 1.3 million customers, or 6.2%, with 5.4% growth at TWC, 7.5% growth at Legacy Charter, and over 8% at Bright House. In voice, we grew customers by 14,000 in the second quarter versus 132,000 last year, with the lower growth largely driven by higher churn at TWC, in part driven by a low price promotional voice offer in TWC markets in prior year quarters.","Over the last year, total residential customers grew by 934,000 or by 3.8%. And residential revenue per customer was down modestly, given smaller price increases this year versus last, continued standalone Internet sell-in and migration activity of TWC and Bright House to Spectrum pricing and packaging, which is richer in value, in particular, as it relates to equipment.","There was also some mechanical ARPU effect from changes to the Legacy Bright House seasonal plan. The slide 7 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 3.8%. Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined, grew by 9.5%. SMB specifically grew by 9.7% and enterprise grew by 9.3%. Excluding cell backhaul and NaviSite, enterprise grew by over 13%.","As Tom mentioned, we have now launched new national pricing and packaging for both enterprise and SMB designed to drive higher customer growth and market share gains. Second quarter advertising revenue declined by 5.8% year-over-year, driven by political advertising in the prior year. Excluding political, advertising revenue was still down about 3% year-over-year given lower year-over-year local and barter revenue. So, in total, second quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 3.9% year-over-year and 4.3% excluding advertising.","Looking at total revenue growth at each of our Legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 3.4%; pre-deal Charter grew by 4.9%, driven by customer growth; and Bright House revenue grew by 4.1% with improving unit growth and little reliance on rate.","As we move to the operating expenses on slide 8, note that this quarter, we reclassified some operating expense between expense lines. We moved bad debt expense and customer bankcard fees from other expense to cost to service customers. We also moved some expenses from the other expense category to marketing expense. And so, today's materials, including our release, trending schedule and presentation provide these reclassifications on a pro forma basis, which allows for proper year-over-year comparison.","In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $83 million or 1.3% year-over-year, with transition expense accounting for $30 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 9.6% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases in renewals and a higher expanded mix, partially offset by transaction synergies.","When you think about programming, keep in mind, we had some synergies already in the second quarter of 2016, but you won't have the same year-over-year benefit later this year. We're also shifting our mix pretty dramatically to higher-value expanded basic, and we've had recent renewals, and we expect significant pay-per-view revenue and expense in the third quarter from an August event.","Regulatory conductivity and produced content expense declined 3.3% year-over-year this quarter as we continue to combine the company's networking contracts. Cost to service customers also declined year-over-year, driven by benefits from the combination of three companies and lower bad debt expense. We're also seeing early productivity benefits from simplified pricing and packaging and higher in-source labor.","Marketing expenses declined by 2.4% year-over-year as we continue to drive overhead synergies from our transactions, which were partially offset by a higher level of marketing and sales activities under Charter's operating model. And finally, other expenses were down 5.2% year-over-year, driven by the elimination of duplicate costs.","Adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.6% in the second quarter. And excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.7%. As we look to the back half of the year, in addition to the lack of political advertising, our EBITDA growth rate will benefit less from transaction synergies than it has over the last four quarters. And the next wave of additional transaction synergies will take some time. As I mentioned last quarter, the full elimination of duplicate costs will take us until early 2019 as we fully integrate the platforms of three companies in multiple billing, provisioning network environment.","And the separate financial benefits from our operating model increase over the same period as the customer base migrates, and the operating investments around in-sourcing and all-digital, for example, as those subside. So similar to subscribers, where we've already turned the corner, and revenue, which will take a few more quarters, our expense development won't be linear. But our view on the long-term growth and profitability potential for Charter remain the same.","Turning to net income on slide 9, we generated $139 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus pro forma net income of $248 million last year with higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of this year, more than offset by higher depreciation and amortization and the one-time pension curtailment gain that we had last year.","Turning to slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the second quarter, including $86 million of transition spend. Excluding transition, second quarter CapEx increased by $98 million year-over-year or 5%, driven by higher spending on CPE, which was offset by timing of spend on scalable infrastructure. The higher CPE spend was largely the result of higher connect volumes, and two-way set-top box placement rates now that Spectrum pricing and packaging has been launched across all of our markets, as well as inventory build related to the same.","As slide 11 shows, we generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter versus $524 million of actual, not pro forma, free cash flow in the second quarter last year. That growth was largely driven by cash flow from acquired systems, but also by EBITDA growth. We also have a continued working capital benefit from timing and our continued improvements on that front.","On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA less CapEx grew by 16% in the second quarter. We finished the quarter with $61.8 billion in debt principal and our run rate annualized cash interest expense is currently $3.4 billion pro forma for our July debt offering; whereas our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggests a $3.0 billion annual run rate. That difference is due to purchase accounting.","As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12 month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.1 times and our long-term target leverage remains at 4 times to 4.5 times. In April, Charter redeemed TWC 5.85% senior secured notes due 2017. Also in April, we closed on $1.25 billion of high-yield notes and $1.25 billion of investment-grade notes. Then in July, we closed on an additional $1.5 billion of investment-grade notes. The proceeds from these offerings have and will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks. Our weighted average cost of debt is now 5.4%, the weighted average life of 11.5 years with over 90% of our debt maturing after 2019.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares in Charter Holding common unit totaling approximately $3.7 billion at an average price of $331 per share. As slide 11 shows, since the start of our buyback program in September of last year until June 30, we spent $6.1 billion on repurchases, reflecting 6% of the company's equity on a fully diluted basis. Our share repurchase activity will continue to depend on other potential uses of capital and market conditions.","Turning to our tax assets on slide 13, we estimate the total present value of those assets, reflecting our current NOL utilization, is approximately $5.5 billion and we don't currently expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until 2019 at the earliest.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Tom, could you talk a little bit about what you and Comcast are working on, on the wireless front? Obviously, there's been a lot in the press about discussions with other wireless companies and Verizon. But just what are you spending your time on in that partnership today? What are your objectives and goals? What do you think you can get out of that as you guys start to launch in 2018? And then, Chris, it's great to hear that connects are growing year-on-year, and I think that's happening despite marketing actually being down. I know there's other drivers of connects than just marketing spend, but could you just talk about the efficiency you're seeing on the customer growth and how you think about sort of cost to add customers as we move forward? It seems like you guys are getting better at that as you integrate these assets. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So, Ben, to the first part of your question, we did announce that we were working with Comcast, because we share the same MVNO, the same company with Verizon, we picked up our MVNO agreement as part of the Time Warner merger. And it is very similar to what Comcast's MVNO is. And they're already launched and down the road and successful with their effort. And because we have the same opportunity as Comcast in terms of using the MVNO to drive our business forward, it makes sense for us to find ways to work together, to be efficient and to know how that MVNO works and to have a good relationship with Verizon. We expect to generate significant growth, ultimately, in that MVNO and significant growth for Verizon as a result of that. And there are opportunities on a national level, which neither Comcast nor Charter has as regional players, that come together in this MVNO, and we'd like to take advantage of them. And that's the reason why we have the relationship.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And on the second question, connects were up at TWC and across the entire company quarter-over-quarter. And as you mentioned, the marketing and sales costs actually came down. I would argue that we're actually spending more and we're doing more activities and, obviously, we have higher sales. The efficiencies you're seeing are really from just the reduction of three different corporate overheads for marketing and sales. So when you think about creative and research and that type of activity, the quote-unquote transaction synergies would actually be much higher than what you're seeing, because the variable activity that we're doing and our willingness to pay commissions and to go drive sales is actually higher. So, I think that \u2013 not to be Debbie Downer, but I think that's short-lived. And as we continue to increase our connects in the transaction synergies in that relatively easy area to get synergies out of will subside, I think you'll see that normalize and be more reflective of what we know at Charter. Now, with the bigger company single set of overhead, can we be more efficient than Legacy Charter was? Yes.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","But the year-over-year benefits as we get through the back half of this year will probably start to decline.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","There is efficiency in the way the new assets fit together, too. In terms of our ability to buy a DMA and buy the same amount of advertising as we used to buy, and reach more serviceable passings than we historically could reach, so just the footprint of the assets makes marketing more efficient.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Ben. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. I just want to focus on your pricing strategy, rather lack thereof. Obviously, you're transitioning the Time Warner Cable and the Bright House base to a common pricing promotion, but you haven't really had any rate increases of any size on the Legacy Charter side. Do we have to sort of wait for that transition to complete to actually have across-the-footprint rate increases? Because I think that's a lever that you haven't used at all. And just depending on this pricing, looking at your standalone broadband offer, which looks so attractive relative to your peer group, I just want to understand the strategy, so sort of helping these virtual MVPD products to probably scale given they can buy broadband at a relatively lower costs, just thoughts on that? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, I'll answer your question. We have a strategy of providing high-quality fully featured, rich products and packages to our customers so that we can grow our customer base and retain our customer base. And we believe that we can continue to accelerate our growth rate through that strategy and drive revenue growth and operating efficiencies with a higher penetrated network and lower network cost per customer, and maximize the free cash flow of the business, ultimately, as a result of our strategy.","So in the pricing and packaging issues that we face today, our biggest issue is the fact that our Legacy customer base has a variety of different pricing scenarios that are inconsistent with the way we're packaging going forward. And in many cases, the equipment rates, for instance, modem charges and other, and set-top boxes are significantly higher than what we're charging on the increment. And we're mixing and matching our growth rate and packagings to maintain existing ARPUs without rate increases and to create products that drive more satisfaction and are stickier in the long run, and do all that with an accelerating growth rate. And so, we're happy with our pricing strategy as it is today.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks so much.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Maybe a couple of questions for Chris, first, on the video trends, you talked about growth in the expanded video sub base and, obviously, still some churn on limited basic side, I think, largely from the TWC deal. How far through that process are you? Is there any color you can give us on how long that's going to last? Does it end sort of this year as we sort of anniversary some of the completion of those promotions? That's number one.","And then number two, on the CapEx side, I think I'm looking at the chart right, but in terms of restarting the all-digital effort, you saw an increase in CapEx and the CPE as you sort of \u2013 I guess it's through front-end loading, the equipment purchases. Should we see that number continue to move up as you move through that process and scale that up? And it's also clear that you've offset some of the spending, because CapEx, in total, were sort of largely flat. Is that sort of how we should think of things as we sort of move into the latter part of the year, and really scaling that all-digital effort? Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","On the limited base development, they're started and announced and I'd say, very large base, a limited base of (28:20) customers at TWC. Not inconsistent with where Legacy Charter was in 2012 and the type of progression that we expect to see there so far has been pretty identical to what we experienced before. So, I think it'll take more than a few quarters, but the real question is at what point do you reach the tipping point where the expanded relationship growth is so large that it overcomes the continued migration and churn that comes out of the limited basic base. And that, I think, still takes a few quarters, but it's significantly improving.","The other metric to keep your eye on is at what point has the TWC base crossed the line of being over 50% in Spectrum pricing and packaging, which is competitive, an advanced product set at peer (29:09) rates that don't explode upon promotional roll-off. And that's why we continue to provide that statistic, because that's when at least one bucket is bigger than the next.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, the only thing I would add is that after three quarters, where that's been rolled out, 43% of the people in our Legacy Time Warner and Bright House footprint are on new pricing and packaging. But we have been doing a rolled phase of the pricing and packaging, so we just finished that in Hawaii. And so, you've got a lot of different quarters in there that came in at different weighted averages.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Right.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So, it's hard to forecast it, but ultimately it turns.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","We're in total, TWC and Bright House, about 30% of that base at the end of Q2. And if you look back to all of our previous disclosure at Legacy Charter and the video trends there, I think that's still as good a proxy as any.","On the CPE side, the CPE inside the quarter was really driven by, frankly, replenishment of inventory out of Q1, higher sales and connects in Q2, higher set-top box placement \u2013 two-way set-top box placement per connect in Q2. Very little of the Q2 CPE spend was really driven by inventory build for all-digital, that's still yet to come. And I think, as you think about the back half of this year, particularly Q4, my guess is that we'll want to highlight that at some point as to what the all-digital CPE build is for inventory in preparation for the larger amount of activity that is taking place in 2018.","From an overall CapEx for this year, relatively flat year-over-year. We've approved a fair amount of capital and we hope that we can spend it. We're not limited by budget, per se, but more about what can practically be done. I think if we're successful, you'll see a higher level of spend in Q3 and Q4, but it makes it a little bit difficult to forecast, because it's simply a function of how much you can get done. I would argue the faster you can get it done and behind you, the better it will be.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, John. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the cost synergy comments that Chris had made. Chris, cost to serve customers was down meaningfully year-over-year this quarter. As we think about the next phase of the cost synergy opportunity from here, is that an area where we should expect to continue to see the most operating leverage? And just wondering if you could also comment maybe on some of the other areas and how we should think about operating leverage in the other costs, marketing, regulatory, et cetera?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. So, the last thing I want to do is get \u2013 we don't provide overall guidance, and I don't want to get into, certainly, a line-by-line cost guidance. I think, as you look back, after the call, some of the prepared remarks I had around the trends and the different moving pieces were designed to help people so that as they're putting their own models together, at least, they can think about it the way we think about it.","Year-over-year, on cost to serve, they're benefits of the combination of the transactions that are accelerated upfront. What hasn't flown into that yet is some of the investments that we make on the operating costs side as we more fully in-source and have the duplication of labor from outsourced labor that's being transitioned out, in-sourced labor that's being transitioned in. And so, the doubling up, so to speak, hasn't totally taken place as of yet.","But we are seeing already, through better utilization and better statistics, the management of the call centers and, fundamentally, a lower drive of calls from Spectrum pricing and packaging because the way it's put together, we are seeing some upfront operational synergies as well as the transaction synergies from the elimination of overhead. But I think it gets a little bit more complicated as time progresses as you have the investments flowing in and the benefits \u2013 the further benefits that take a little bit of time to flow back into the P&L. And that's really the nature of the comments that I was providing in the prepared remarks.","So, I think our expense development is not going to be linear. We know exactly where we're going, but there are a lot of moving parts in each one of those lines. And I think people will have to take a look back to \u2013 in terms of operating leverage, what we said from the outset is that we think the margin on this business, as we sell more and get better utilization of fixed assets, is very, very good. But it doesn't mean that it won't go up and down, and it certainly won't be a straight line.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. So, in the transition process, obviously, you have more anomalies in terms of quarter-over-quarter price \u2013 or cost changes, because of the synergies of the company coming together and the work that's necessary to put the company together. But the fundamental objective of creating high-value packages with high-quality service, which improves customer satisfaction, which extends customer life and reduces total volume of transactions because longer life, less churn means that, for the same amount of revenue, you have less connects and disconnects and less marketing expense per dollar of revenue. And with higher-quality service and less repeat service calls, you've less service cost per customer. And with higher penetration, you have less network cost per customer, if you're growing your business. And so, all of our trend lines and all of our strategy is designed to be a more efficient business through quality service.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a quick question for Mr. Winfrey. We're using EBITDA less CapEx per home passed to sort of benchmark you guys versus some of your peers. And you guys are doing a great job. But as I sort of think about that gap closing, it seems like there's two buckets. There's the operational side and then there's the synergy side. I think you've given us good percentages on the operational side, the 43% that are on the new packages and pricing, Legacy TWC\/Bright House. On the synergy side, high level, without a dollar number, how far along do you think you are on that process of realizing sort of all the synergies?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Sure. A couple of things. One, when you think about EBITDA minus CapEx per home passed...","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","You really have to think about customer relationship growth in that mix. It is expensive to go acquire customers, both on the OpEx side, through marketing and sales costs and the upfront cost to provision and call centers; and it's expensive on the CapEx side as well. So, if I wanted to drive our EBITDA minus CapEx to industry-leading numbers, we could do that and we could do it relatively quickly, and I think it'd be very bad for the equity. So, you just need to be careful with are you looking at it moment in time, you looking it over two years, or are you looking at it over five years, because that...","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, over five. Let's say, over five years.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Okay. So then, from a synergy perspective, we've done everything that we thought we were going to do so far, and we're very pleased with where we're at. And there is nothing that would cause us to be any more conservative around what we thought we would do over a three-year time period.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","But offsetting that, as I've said many times before, we have \u2013 you see a transition cost line, that is not the tip of the iceberg in terms of the amount of friction and the investment that is going on inside the business and intentional duplication that occurs until you're able to transition some of these systems. And all of that's designed to minimize customer service disruptions so that you can continue to grow fencing (37:52) along the way.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And do you think all of that will be complete, say, in five years?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Five years, yeah, I think as you get into early 2019 or, call it, mid 2019 is when you start to see it moving on all fronts.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thank you for that.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jason. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Tom, maybe just a comment, Comcast made some comments this morning regarding wireless, and obviously we know what they're doing and at least the timing of what you're planning to do. So, the comment was just sort of saying that wireless is a tough industry and historically, I think, people have thought you guys might be interested in owners' economics at some point. Has anything changed in your view on that front? And then secondly, just on the single-play penetration, how high do we think that should go over time, and what impact, maybe for Chris, would that have on the margin profile of the company?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I would (38:59) say I agree with Comcast's point of view on that. But we like our MVNO, We like our relationship with Verizon. We like our potential relationship with Comcast. And we do think that the industry has a lot of challenges in front of it, and that it's fully penetrated. That gives us a tremendous opportunity as new entrants with other high-quality services to package with it. But I agree with their point of view.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","On single-play, look, it's not our stated goal. Our stated goal is to get as many services into the home, because we think that's the best way that we can deliver value to the consumer and retain that consumer for a longer period of time. And by having a higher amount of revenue per household, even if we're saving the customer a lot of money, means that we've got better utilization of our network. Your question is, what's the margin profile of a company that becomes more Internet and single-play focused over time. And I think the answer is, it depends on how far penetrated you get with that Internet product in that single play. If you had 100% of the households on single-play Internet, that'd be a pretty nice business with very high margin, and it has lower CapEx.","But they're small, and I don't know how relevant they are to Charter, but there are some other companies who have public numbers who have gone down \u2013 intentionally gone down the path of that strategy, because they've given up on video. And when you look at revenue and EBITDA growth, I think our plan is working better from an overall output perspective. And I think it provides us much more optionality down the road. And we still think video is a very good business. It doesn't have a dissimilar gross margin as it relates to Internet. It maybe has a different margin percent \u2013 gross margin percent, but dollars of margin is what matters. And we think video is still very important to selling Internet. And if we didn't push or have an attractive video product, we would sell less Internet, and I think, one way or another, that's the right way to think about it.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Your guy line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. First, where are we in the IT and billing system migrations? I saw headline last week that you'd signed a contract with someone. And then second if, Chris, you could dig in a little bit more the Legacy TWC improvements, gross adds and really picking up of new connections or \u2013 versus shrinking pool of potential churners? And are you doing better with saves and upgrades as people call and are pushed up in terms of price? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So with regard to IT, we actually have four billing vendors, one of which is quite small, Hawaii-only, so three for most of the country. And we have continued relationships with those vendors. Our strategy is to build a uniform front-facing engine over top of all the legacy billing systems and provisioning systems so that every customer service representative that we have and every field person who also has a tablet, essentially every front-line person in the company and every customer is looking at the same set of prices, packages and service infrastructure information about their account in the same format everywhere across the country, regardless of who the underlying IT vendors are. And we're well on our way to doing that.","When we closed the deal, we had 11 different billing environments. So, even though we had four billing vendors, we had multiple instances of the same vendor, where traffic, meaning calls and customer service activity, couldn't be moved from one zone to another. Although they're not geographic, the customer base inside of any one of those instances is limited to the service infrastructure that was built at that scale. And so, by the end of this year, we'll be at three. And at the end of next year, we'll be at one, meaning one environment with an umbrella over top of, what we call an abstraction layer. And we'll be able to provide a consistent high-quality service product and have virtual service anywhere, anytime, any place from any person in Charter, and that's our objective. And so, our relationship to the billing vendors is consistent with that strategy.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Churn for the TWC Legacy base, it remains elevated, and for the base that's not converted over to Spectrum pricing and packaging. And it's going to continue to remain elevated in that segment until it's fully migrated or churned out over time. We're doing on the margin better on saves inside that footprint now that Spectrum pricing and packaging is rolled out, but given the nature of some of the packages and the level of promotional pricing versus rack rate pricing that existed in those legacy packages, even with Spectrum pricing and packaging, sometimes, that's a difficult save because of the way that it was sold in. So it will happen over time, but it's not going to be overnight, and there's no special pill.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Should we think about the new Spectrum pricing and packaging churn as sort of similar to Legacy Charter churn? And even within older pricing base, that churn is coming down as well, that's a fair way to interpret what you said?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Over time, that's correct, is that it should all converge and we know what that should look like. The difference in the short term is that the tenure of a customer has an impact on the level of churn. So as you sell more, that has a temporary impact of having slightly higher churn. And that's the case with any cable business. So, the answer to your question is, yes, over the mid to long term, but the level of selling activity also has an impact.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Phil. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Kannan Venkat from Barclays. Your line is open.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So, Chris, a question on programming cost, basically, you guys just signed a deal with Fox News, I think, and it looks like you guys have a couple of other big deals coming up over the course of the next one year. How should we think about that now that the synergy component in that cost line is more or less behind us? If you could help us with that, that will be great. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, I think the fundamental issue is that we have achieved synergies in our programming costs as a result of the transaction and our management of the contracts within the company. That said, the general trend is still pretty much like it has been for a number of years. And when people talk about what's going to happen to the video business three, five years from now, I say it looks a lot like it does now. And you still have large programming entities with a need for pricing, even though that pricing on the margin is negatively affecting the whole category, because you're pricing people out of the market for video, rich, fat bundles of full-service video.","Given what's happening to advertising and distraction of viewers, and that overall penetration of MVPD-like services, the revenue that programmers are going to drive is primarily going to come from rate. So, you're going to still have the kind of environment we've been in, I think, going forward, for a significant period of time. And so, our objective is to manage that and to manage our customer relationships and to keep the video business working for us. But it is the high-cost business, and one of the big inputs is programming, and it's going to continue to be outsized in terms of its impact on cost.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And for Charter, we'll need to be talking about it on a per expanded customer relationship, similar to what we did at Legacy Charter over time given the transition of the base out of more limited packages of TWC into more expanded. So, there are going to be multiple pieces, and similar to what we've done in the past, we'll be breaking that out over time.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And Tom, if I could follow up, recently there has been, I think, some announcements from you guys as well on skinny bundles. How do you see the opportunity there? Is it largely a broadband-only opportunity, and how big is that market from your perspective and your footprint?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I think there may be some market there and we have some experimental marketing activity in that space, but it hasn't yet been demonstrated to be a significant niche. And most of the people that are looking at skinny bundles are looking for price. And the problem is that they don't satisfy from a consumption perspective. And so, people come in and out of the category, there is more churn as a result of that with \u2013 the demand is still there, but the ability to pay for it isn't. So, the answer is, I don't know. But it's not in programmers' interest to have themselves get disaggregated from the big bundle and become much lower-penetrated niche services. And so, I think that continued objective of staying in a big package will continue to drive a model, so to speak, of programming distribution.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Kannan. Michelle, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your final question will come from Jennifer Reif (sic) [Jessica Reif] from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. It's Jessica Reif. I have three follow-ups, I guess. First, I guess on the programming discussion, there's a lot of talk about consolidation on the programming side. Can you talk about your views of how that potentially changing landscape might affect you? Does it change anything that you just said? Second, Tom, just a follow-up on the comments you made about the Comcast deal. Can you just give us some color behind why the exclusivity, the one-year exclusive deal? What benefits do you get out of that as opposed to just a general deal? And then, finally, I guess, for Chris, I heard your comments on the buyback. But can you give us some kind of a near-term outlook about the pace? I know you said it depends on other uses, but you are at kind of the low end of your target leverage of 4 times to 4.5 times. Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, on programming consolidation, obviously depending on how significant it was, it could have an impact on pricing power of entities. And I think there are some smaller companies there that have questionable pricing power and you can see them wanting to align themselves to get it. And so, I think you'll see some. But it's hard for me to quantify it, other than to say that it's consistent with what I previously said. Why the one-year exclusivity with Comcast? I said earlier that we have the same MVNO. We wanted to work together, we wanted to find a way to make that in MVNO work, and we thought we needed a significant period of time to be able to work together comfortably on the same business plan with regard to the MVNO. And the one year gives us that. Chris, I don't know if...","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","On the buyback, Jessica, look, I get it. I understand why everybody would like to have quarterly or annual guidance for knowing what portion of our free cash flow would be used for buybacks or otherwise. But I don't believe that's smart for us or it's the best outcome for shareholders. And by that, I mean, getting locked into a guidance of sort and having people be disappointed if you found the better opportunity somewhere for deploying that capital may put you in a situation where you end up taking a bad decision just to please previous guidance. And so, that really is the driver of not providing the guidance or an outlook, and making sure that we have the flexibility to do what we think is right in terms of where we deploy the capital, either internally or externally, or as it relates to buybacks. So, we're not going to be, at least at this stage, getting into that mode of providing that guidance.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Thomas M.

Residential PSUs grew by 70,000 during the second quarter, up from 55,000 in the year-ago period but also growing market share and expanded basic video and we expect to continue to grow overall video relationships in 2015.","Commercial PSUs grew by 31,000 during the second quarter, up from 19,000 in the second quarter of last year and revenue grew by 7.6% and by 7.8% excluding cyclical advertising. Excluding M&A transaction costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.9%. Chris will cover the quarterly results in more detail.","Over the last three years of Charter, our growth strategy has been driven by superior products, combined with high-quality service at highly competitive prices. Today we're the fastest growing publicly traded cable company in the United States and our customers are increasingly satisfied with both our products and our service. Getting to this point has been a multi-year process. We increased investment in service, operations, infrastructure and our product set and fundamentally changed the way we operate the business.","We implemented our all-digital initiative over the course of 18 months. Completed at the end of 2014, all-digital has allowed us to unleash the full capabilities of our network by unburdening it from analog signals, giving us more network capacity to differentiate our products from those offered by satellite and telco competitors; starting with over 200 channels of HD, more than satellite, and the interactive programming guide, and video-on-demand using fully featured two-way set-top boxes on every TV outlet. Our minimum Internet speed is 60 megabits and in some areas like St. Louis, minimum Internet speed is 100 megabits, and we have a fully-featured voice product.","When we combine these products into simple, but easy to understand packages that we call Spectrum, those packages have no early termination fees, no modem rental fees, no data caps or usage-based pricing, and we offer the Spectrum product set at highly competitive prices, including a fully featured triple play starting package priced at just $90 a month.","Following the closing, we will continue to take both the Time Warner Cable and Bright House footprints all-digital in order to rollout our Spectrum product suite, which has been fundamental to our growth and success at Charter. As we complete all-digital and roll out Spectrum, Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers will also get access to our most advanced and latest hardware and applications including Worldbox, our new, more advanced set-top box which uses a downloadable conditional access security system and is designed to evolve as video services increasingly become IP-based.","Worldbox can be sourced from multiple manufacturers and we'll also rollout Spectrum Guide, our new and highly advanced cloud-based guide that can function on all of our two-way set-top boxes regardless of their age or processing power; meaning the customers will have access to the same IP interface they already enjoy on handheld devices without having to swap out boxes.","The guide will vastly improve search and discovery functionality which also enables on-demand offerings and it gives us the ability to offer over-the-top content applications directly on the box where we intend to provide customers with greater choice when switching between traditional video and alternative entertainment.","We'll also improve our Spectrum TV app, which uses the same guide and offers live feed inside and outside the home on devices beyond the TV as well as both video-on-demand and download-to-go functionality. We will combine our app with the innovative Time Warner cable app to develop a best-in-class app for consumers. We'll also continue to work to develop a new video product to serve that segment of customers who want high-quality video offerings available on multiple devices but at a lower retail price than our current expanded offering.","That product still has to offer real value in order for it to succeed and we're working through programming rights and access platforms to create a product that sells, sticks, and can be used for upgrading the full Spectrum product suite. As I noted in last quarter, we haven't found the right mix yet, and we don't think anyone else has either.","Our success over the last three years hasn't just been about offering better products, pricing, and packaging, it's also been about offering better service. We've done that by investing in call center and field operations' infrastructure and by in-house customer care and field operations' workforces.","Over the last three years, Charter's brought back jobs from overseas call centers and hired thousands of people to improve our service. Our more in-house workforce is better trained, properly incented and better equipped with standardized tools and test equipment and software platforms. That results in more focus on craftsmanship and management being the faster times to resolution and fewer calls per customer, all of which is driving fewer transactions, higher customer satisfaction, lower churn, and a better return on growth investments.","Using the same philosophy for years, Bright House has been the industry leader in customer service and we will combine the best practices of our organizations and apply them across New Charter. As part of this effort New Charter will return Time Warner Cable's call center's jobs to the United States, will hire and train thousands of new employees for our customer service call centers and field technical operations.","As we look ahead to closing, we're moving forward with our integration plans to put the new company on a growth path. Previous deal integration planning and investments we made in 2013 and 2014 have provided a good start and should accelerate the integration of the new transactions. I believe we're going to create a lot of value for New Charter.","From a financing perspective, we've now secured about 90% of the debt financing to fund the cash portions of our transactions. As Chris will discuss, we raised that debt with very attractive rates and our balance sheet is in a very good place both with respect to the cost of debt and our maturity profile.","Turning to the regulatory approval process of our transaction for a moment; our transactions will create a highly-competitive service provider with no control of national programming or over-the-top assets, less video coverage than Comcast or AT&T, less ISP market share than Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. And in June we submitted a filing to the FCC which clearly demonstrates why our transactions are in the public interest. That document outlines how our strategy will produce significant benefits for a larger group of consumers.","I'll start with broadband. Charter's slowest broadband tier is 60 megabits. We will offer that \u2013 this fast, minimum broadband speed to Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers. Additionally, Charter will continue Time Warner Cable and Bright House's highly advanced 300 megabit service.","New Charter will introduce its current pricing model which is less expensive for consumers than Time Warner Cable and Bright House's comparable offerings. Our broadband product features straightforward, national uniform pricing with no data caps, no usage-based pricing, no modem fees and no early termination fees. New Charter will broaden access to broadband by building upon Bright House's broadband program for low-income consumers.","Consistent with our commitment to deliver superior broadband service designs for data intensive applications like online video, Charter's long practiced network neutrality and we will continue to not block or slow down Internet traffic or engage in paid prioritization. And we consistently invested in interconnection capacity to avoid network congestion.","We've also committed to continue settlement-free interconnection and if interconnection disputes do arise, we've committed to submitting them to the FCC for resolution on a case-by-case basis. These interconnection commitments have been recognized by content and interconnection providers like Netflix and Cogent who publicly support the approval of our proposed transactions.","As I mentioned earlier, we will bring back thousands of new jobs to America and improve Charter's customer service. In addition to rolling out more advanced services like Spectrum Guide and Worldbox, New Charter will invest significantly in both in-home and out-of-home Wi-Fi. We'll deploy over 300,000 out-of-home Wi-Fi access points.","New Charter will also build out one million in new line extensions of our network into residential areas within our footprint beyond where we currently operate. These new facilities will help provide high-speed service to rural and other underserved areas.","New Charter will invest at least $2.5 billion in the build-out of networks into commercial areas within our footprint beyond where we currently operate. This would create additional much needed competition in the commercial services space.","For all these reasons, we believe New Charter is in the public interest. With respect to the timing of close, we're working to close our transactions by year end.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide eight of today's presentation, we grew residential PSUs by 70,000 during the quarter. And in video, we lost 33,000 residential customers. Excluding bulk customers, however, we lost 28,000 video customers compared to 44,000 last year. So the trend continues to improve. As Tom mentioned, we continue to expect video customer net adds for the full year. In residential Internet, we added 70,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 33,000. Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 261,000, or 4.6%.","In a seasonally weak quarter, we grew residential customer relationships by 34,000 and second quarter residential ARPU rose by 2.5% year-over-year driven by sell-in, step-ups and rate adjustments although at a lower level than last year. Second quarter ARPU did benefit from the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight and excluding pay-per-view events this quarter and in the prior-year period, residential ARPU grew by about 2%. Slide 10 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 7% compared to 6.4% last year.","Turning to commercial, we added 31,000 PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging to the small and medium business segment in the first quarter. Commercial revenue grew by approximately 14%, driven primarily by small and medium businesses.","Our advertising revenue was virtually flat year-over-year, and excluding political advertising, ad sales grew by just over 6%. In total, revenue was up by 7.6% in Q2 with a lower level of annual rate increases and more than two-thirds of that growth coming from customer growth.","Turning to operating expense and adjusted EBTIDA in slide 11, total operating expenses grew by $118 million or 8% year-over-year of which transition OpEx related to our previous transactions with Comcast accounted for about $17 million. Excluding transition costs, total expenses grew 6.9% year-over-year, with total programming expense growing by $64 million, accounting for about half the year-over-year increase in total operating expense.","The 10.3% increase in programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers, of our carriage and the launch of new channels as well as the Mayweather-Pacquiao event. Excluding pay-per-view and a large one-time expense benefit in the second quarter of last year, programming grew by about 8% year-over-year.","Costs to service customers which includes field operations, customer care and network operating costs were flat year-over-year, as we are seeing a significant reduction in service transaction volumes for the reasons Tom mentioned. Other costs grew by $35 million or 18% year-over-year, driven by some additional administrative labor expense, property taxes on previous CapEx and insurance on a larger service employee base, an increase in bad debt, as well as higher labor costs to support ad sales in commercial.","Excluding transition-related expenses, second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by about 8.9% year-over-year and even that includes $14 million of one-time benefits in the prior year expense base. Meaning the underlying trend is very good. So as a result of our operating strategy, we're seeing continuous improvement in Charter's operating and financial metrics and that momentum continues.","We'll duplicate that strategy on a much larger set of assets following our transactions with TWC and Bright House and we believe we can deliver the type of customer growth and financial growth along a similar timeline as we've seen at Charter across this larger set of assets not only because we'll enhance the product set and service, but also because New Charter will offer significantly better D&A coverage, providing greater marketing efficiencies, larger opportunities in commercial to serve multi-site tenants in the medium and enterprise markets and of course, synergies both in our operating expense base and our ability to deploy cloud-based capital investments in CPE more efficiently. The TWC and Bright House assets also provide a better starting point than Charter in 2012 given their historical investment and progress in all-digital to date.","Moving to slide 13, second quarter capital expenditures totaled $432 million with $28 million related to M&A transactions mostly as part of the Comcast transactions. Much of the transition capital, as Tom mentioned, includes software platforms that includes their next-generation gateway, provisioning and service layer, our billing isolation layer and a new data warehouse each for multiple legacy billing and provisioning platforms. So these platform investments would have occurred over the next couple of years in any event and actually provide us a head start to providing a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers.","The year-over-year decline in total CapEx was driven by the completion of all-digital during the fourth quarter of last year and excluding all-digital last year and transition CapEx this year, our CapEx was down by just over $30 million or 7% despite faster PSU growth in both residential and commercial.","So we're seeing the kind of post all-digital decline and capital intensity that we expected and we'd expect the same to occur after the completion of all-digital at TWC and Bright House. We continue to expect approximately $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in 2015 excluding spending related to acquisitions.","If you look at adjusted EBITDA less CapEx at the top of slide 14, the increased contribution to cash flow was about $191 million, and it's $45 million higher if you exclude the transition cost in both adjusted EBITDA and CapEx I just mentioned.","Free cash flow also improved year-over-year with EBITDA up, CapEx down and the working capital headwind that we saw in the first quarter from all-digital now behind us. Free cash flow growth would have been even higher if not for $45 million of transition expense in CapEx we just covered, M&A expenses which are included below adjusted EBITDA and other expenses, and $100 million of cash interest paid during the quarter from the $7 billion of escrow in Comcast transaction debt that we repaid to investors in April.","If we turn to our balance sheet, in April we executed a number of debt refinancings with new notes at CCOH which reduced our weighted average borrowing cost which was 5.2% at the end of the quarter. Our current leverage ratio is 4.3 times on an LTM basis and within our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times.","In July, so after the quarter, we completed over $19 billion in financings for our transactions with TWC and Bright House. That includes $15.5 billion of debt in the investment grade market with an average cost of 5.26% and an average maturity of 15.5 years. That's in addition to the $2 billion term loan A financing at LIBOR plus 200 basis points and $3.8 billion of debt in the term loan market at an average cost of about 3.4%.","So New Charter has access to all pockets in the debt markets which provide significant flexibility. As Tom mentioned, we completed about 90% of the debt financing needed at closing with $2.5 billion remaining, but we will be opportunistic.","Assuming a $100 cash election option for TWC shareholders in the deal, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5 times at close. That's based on 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and including $500 million of assumed year one synergies. That's at the higher end of our target leverage range but we will be poised to mechanically delever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. Our target leverage for New Charter will remain 4 to 4.5 times, but we look to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range and we're committed to maintaining an investment grade index rating at the secured level with first new leverage under 3.5 times.","I won't go back through all of our existing tax assets which are laid out, again, inside the presentation, but I'd reiterate that both the TWC and Bright House transactions will enhance the value of our existing tax assets. The Bright House transaction actually will create new tax assets through our partnership structure that drives value for both New Charter shareholders and Advance\/Newhouse.","In total, we estimate that New Charter's tax assets are worth approximately $6 billion in net present time. That's comprised of over $3 billion of Charter's existing tax assets today both through our outsized basis and NOLs. The $1.5 billion of excess basis that sits at TWC today, $400 million of value created by the accelerated use of our NOLs post close and the approximately $1 billion in net present value that we estimate the Bright House transactions drive given the tax basis step up that should result from Advance\/Newhouse ultimately exchanging its partnership units into New Charter stock.","Operator, with that we're now ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thank you. I have two. So, Tom, Time Warner Cable is undergoing a strategy that seems to look very similar that Charter introduced, I think, last October. And that will transition to sort of rolling out the promotions this October. And can you sort of talk about what you think about that strategy because it's going to drive a big piece of the growth in 2016, if that transition works well, if you have any thoughts on that?","And second, I think you have an affiliate deal with a programmer that was supposed to come to an end in July. Assuming there's no channels dropped, can we assume that that negotiation went well? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we didn't drop any channels in July. And so to the extent that's a good thing, yes, everything has gone well. In terms of the Time Warner Cable strategy, they do seem to be doing better, much better in terms of creating unit growth and obviously financial growth, as we've shown, follows unit growth and so we're pleased with the track they're are on and that they're able to keep their focus and grow their business and stay on strategy. And as you look at Charter's performance over the last several years and seen how the curve works in terms of investment activity and then growth, first starting with customer growth and then followed by financial growth, I think you should expect those kinds of results in the future on the combined entities.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, thanks. Just had a few CapEx-related questions. I guess first, Tom, how do you think about the set-top box cost curves from here and in particular, do you have any ideas to when Charter will shift away from storage in the box to storage in the network?","And I was also wondering, just how exactly going all-digital impacts your volume of truck rolls over time and what benefits that could yield to the business?","And then lastly, just a quick one on the CMTS you're deploying today, how many channels are you bonding now, I'm just wondering what we're up to now? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Well, on the last one, I believe CMTS bonding is at 24 channels.","In terms of storage, well, let me start where you started, the set-top box curve; we continue to see opportunity there in terms of pricing and with our downloadable security and our ability to source from multiple locations. And one of the big factors in boxed class is storage in the box, the hard drive and whether that should be in the network or not. I think increasingly it'll move to the network and to the extent that DVR functionality is still a big in the \u2013 sort of a big demand issue and the reason I say like that is more and more product is becoming available on demand. And so the opportunity to see anything you might want to see is available pretty almost all the time whether you have storage in the box or not. So my view is that that puts pressure ultimately on storage costs and it argues that storage should move to the network. And I think you'll increasingly see that happen, although we're still putting out lots of DVR set-top boxes and those boxes are continuing to go down in price \u2013 down the price curve.","With regard to digital and truck rolls, yeah the, I mean the all-digital network is a more reliable network and an easier network to monitor. And as a result of that, your ability to look at the whole service infrastructure and do preventative intelligent maintenance allows you to reduce truck rolls in the historic cable television architecture and so does high-quality service and doing the job right and we're increasingly taking transactions out of our business. And the ability to turn on and off customers remotely also takes truck rolls out of the business and none of that existed in an analog world. So we expect that the operating cost curve will continue to improve as a result of the all-digital investment.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I know AT&T just announced a new product, it looks like a quad play for $200. I don't know if you had any time to think about this in terms of your strategy; if this is something that you would look to do also?","And then sort of related to that, T-Mo has been pretty open about wanting to partner with cable. I think they've kind of suggested Comcast but given you're not going to be that much smaller than Comcast, what do you think about eventually partnering with a wireless company?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, look, I think wireless is a component of our service already. We continue to rollout our Wi-Fi product and the bulk of wireless activity on smartphones today is on the Wi-Fi product that we've deployed. And so I think there are opportunities, business opportunities to create mobility for us whether that's with T-Mo or any other provider for that matter. I think opportunities exist there and people are trying to figure out the right business models to do that.","I do think AT&T's new product, to the extent it's a combination of a bunch of disparate pieces that they've put together, is a good marketing idea for them. I think those kinds of activities have been done in the past. For instance, the app with TV on a smartphone is available from Charter today. If you want to watch every channel we have, you can watch it on your AT&T, or your Verizon, or your T-Mo or Sprint smartphone. You can watch TV everywhere in the house or out of the house; you can watch the whole cable service in the house or wherever you do business. And so, the ability to put content on the smartphone is being done today and as I already said, the majority of the data on the smartphone come from the Wi-Fi network that we deploy. But the thrust of your question is, should we have a mobile product and the answer is yes, we should ultimately figure out how to create our service infrastructure everywhere we are and where our customers are.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess first, Tom, can you talk about the long-term potential for Charter and the Time Warner Cable footprints? When you came to Charter a few years ago, you talked about EBITDA per home passed potential at Charter compared to Cablevision at the time. Is Charter's potential still as high it was and is Time Warner Cable's footprint as valuable given this higher level of competition?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the answer is yes it is valuable and I still look at Charter as a diamond in the rough although we're polishing the diamond, and it's, we have made improvements in penetration of customers, and \u2013 but there's still a lot of runway ahead of us \u2013 and I like our momentum at Charter and we want to apply the same kind of opportunity against both Bright House and Time Warner Cable assets. If you look at their current penetrations, they're similar to Charter's in almost every way. And so, that means that the footprint and the runway is bigger in the combined company and the opportunity's bigger.","And yes, the fundamental point I was making when I came to Charter, which is that the big opportunity is in creating customer relationships and growing the EBITDA per home passed, meaning having a higher return to the physically deployed assets that already exist by improving the revenue per deployed dollar of asset out there is another way of describing the same phenomenon, which is penetration creates enormous amount of value in a network. And that's where the big upside is and I still see that as our long-run opportunity.","The way you get there though is not an easy path. It means you've got to stand up better products; got to stand up better services; you got to be able to compete in the marketplace against an array of competitors who will come through time and you have to be quicker and better. And I think we can do that.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. First, Tom, can you go back to your prepared comments about working to find sort of a new video product at a lower price point than expanded basic. You said you're working through programming rights but you also said you didn't think anybody had found the right mix yet. And I'm assuming you're including things like Sling from Dish and Internet Plus from Comcast. Just what are you trying to build if you could control all the pieces of the puzzle? What's your optimal product set look like from a technology and content perspective? Anything you could share with us would be great.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Well, I think it's not really a technology issue at all. There are trends in technology, whether you're using IP or MPEG or whether you can \u2013 you can put all the products that we currently have today on pretty much any device. So the real question is what are the right structures around what you can sell? And it's easy to sell basic-only cable. It's easy to sell basic-only cable with pay TV, but does that really satisfy a broad swath of American consumers and is that an opportunity? And I think the answer to that is not really. I mean, there's always been a group of people that will buy that. But if you tell people that's cable, they'll ultimately become dissatisfied with it.","So the issue is, can you tailor rich products to specific demographics and satisfy someone's complete need for consumption of video in a product that's reasonably priced. And price is the big issue. And it's a difficult thing because right now, we have video services that are being sold to 100 million homes in a big bundle. And it's very efficient from a revenue perspective and from an advertising perspective. And so it's hard for anyone to want to pull that apart and find a way to make it work.","But it certainly could be \u2013 it's certainly gotten very expensive and you see on the edges people are not buying that full package because they can't afford it mostly. And if you could do it less expensively, it'd be very satisfying. And yet some of the content companies would suffer dramatically in that kind of environment.","So that's why we don't have the product yet but to the extent that content companies are willing to create packages that are tailorable to specific groups of consumers, we'd be interested in trying to do that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense. And just quickly, for Chris on the broadband revenue you called out or your slide deck calls out, higher bundle revenue allocation and some price adjustments. Is there anything in the quarter that helped drive the data revenue? I realize product ARPUs don't tell you a lot. But it was a pretty big sequential increase in data ARPU.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So you'll remember, Ben, a couple of years ago we stopped intentionally producing the product ARPU, really focusing people on the residential revenue per household, particularly because of the bundle allocation and it makes it somewhat irrelevant. What matters is where are you on triple play, where are you on single play, what's the revenue per household that you're getting and that's why the 2.5% year-over-year uplift is really the right metric to take a look at.","Now technically the answer to your question is based on where we're pricing the roll off, the promotional roll offs amongst the different products and then adding to that some of the GAAP adjustments in addition to the billing adjustments that get made. You can have real fluctuations in the product revenues that are taking place. Things hadn't dramatically changed in Q2, and if you take a look, we've continued to grow our spend in video customer base. We haven't taken massive \u2013 we haven't taken significant rate increases on any of the products and yet the video revenue slowed down just a little bit, and the broadband revenue ticked up quite a bit; that is entirely due to allocations as opposed to some fundamental trend in the business.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, both.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey guys, thanks. Tom, maybe just a quick comment. I mean we're sort of stepping around the issue of the skinny bundles, but I mean what it really comes down to I think at some point is the industry going \u00e0 la carte. And I guess I'd like your view on what that means from a distribution standpoint and clearly, the programmers are probably not incented to go that way but it seems like that's the way a lot of the new generations or demographic want to go.","So some thoughts around that and then maybe one for Chris on the margins; in the face of some transition costs obviously hitting the numbers this year, how should we think about margins on a year-over-year basis and just thinking about the back half? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, the way I would say is, first of all the way to think about skinny bundles, they're still bundles; they just cost less. And maybe they have products that you like to watch in them. But obviously if you could get the whole package for the same price as the skinny package, like as a whole package and so you might want to see everything. So everybody wants everything but it's a cost issue and it's all stuck together. And when you look at the demographic changes in behavior, some of that is situational. People don't have houses, don't have big screen TVs, don't have money and you put all that together and the only way to get access to video is through over-the-top or small screen kinds of video services. That doesn't mean that the big products aren't desirable. It just means that they're very expensive and that people's lifestyles are putting them in a situation where they don't have access to them and those lives \u2013 and a lot of that is a function of the economic situation.","So we would like to have \u2013 if we had our druthers, we'd buy all our products \u00e0 la carte wholesale and we'd make the packages up to satisfy the consumers. That's not the way the world works. That's not the way content is sold to us. We have to take it in big packages. And as I said earlier, it was a very good model. It's peaked but it's difficult to make it get better and so there's a lot of pressure in the system. My sense is that it isn't all about to fall apart and that we'll be having this conversation three years from now because I think there is nothing to incent anyone to pull it apart.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Along those lines, Tom, when you think about HBO NOW and the possibility of others and I'm not suggesting ESPN anytime soon, but when those go direct and I think using Apple as a platform and saying you need to have an Apple product; that's sort of like going direct-to-consumer. How much power does that give you guys to discuss that kind of \u00e0 la carte move with Time Warner, for example?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, to the extent that people go \u00e0 la carte direct, I think they lower their value to us which is ultimately good for our cost structure. And I think you have a little of that already occurring in the ecosystem to the extent that people have leaked out content out of what they sell us into other spaces and trying to go after ancillary revenues. They've devalued their core product and they may or may not be carried in the future as a result of that. And so, I think like all things, no trend goes unchecked forever.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Plus it made less secure.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. That's true too. It devalues content.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right, so Mike to your question on margin. First you're right to point out excluding the transition costs, those are exclusively related to the integration process. But in terms of the margin as a percent, it's not something that we ever manage internally the business towards a percent margin. What we do is we manage towards cash flow increases and ROI. In some sense, margin percent can be an output or indicator of that but it's not how we're looking at it from quarter-to-quarter.","In terms of growth, all that being said and all of our transactions are down, so voluntary churn is coming down, on-pay churn is coming down, service calls are coming down, truck rolls are coming down and other than programming, it's labor that's the big cost inside the business. And so our efficiency on a cost per relationship is getting better and to Tom's point as you have more relationships on the fixed plants or asset infrastructure, then your margin is set to increase for both of those; both as the variable costs per customer are coming down as well as better penetration on the fixed assets. So the trends look pretty good today.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks guys.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. It looks like the telco has added quite a bit, much fewer video subs than we expected here in the second quarter. Are you guys benefiting to any extent in terms of less competition from traditional providers?","And then second of all, can you give us an update on the Spectrum Guide, how quickly you expect that to be rolled out and if you expect that to have any positive impact on the sub trends? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I wouldn't say that the competitive environment is improved or any better at all. I think our video business and our whole business continues to improve and it's improving because of the investments we've made and the quality of our product against our competitors' products and so we're optimistic about our ability to grow our video business and we are growing \u2013 obviously our data business and voice business. That's at the expense of other competitors but the competitive environment doesn't seem different; in fact, it's increasingly competitive.","In terms of our Guide, we're deploying it and testing it and getting ready to operationalize it. Our plan was to do about half of our customer base \u2013 half our retained customer base, right \u2013 which I guess would be in the range of 1.6 million would be what, half of what that would have been.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that's still our plan and we \u2013 obviously we haven't operationalized it yet but we plan to shortly \u2013 and we'll learn some things. And in terms of our speed and our ability to roll it out but, we think we can do what we said we're going to do.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from Moffett Capital. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yes, hi. I wonder if you could go back to the proxy that you filed a while ago where you talked about capital intensity in the out years coming down quite substantially. I'm not asking you to give further guidance beyond that but just if you could conceptually talk about how the capital intensity of the business long-term looks in your eyes as you \u2013 is there a point when set-top boxes are largely out of the equation \u2013 and what might capital intensity look like in that scenario?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Craig. As you know, I've said capital intensity is coming out of the business. I've been saying it for a long time even while I spend more sometimes. And I still believe in the long run that it is true that capital intensity is coming out of the business for a lot of reasons. One is if you grow, if you just think about variable capital and fixed capital, if you grow and all your revenue \u2013 if nothing changed on per customer basis \u2013 if you just grow, your mix of variable and fixed capital changes to the favorable. So it's capital, it's capital-intensive favorable to have growth, all other things being equal, on a network platform.","There is Moore's Law with regard to set-tops where you can make the case that set-tops can come out of the business and that they will; that just means we're back to cable-ready television which has been an issue over and over in the business. And the only reason we have set-top boxes is because televisions can't connect to our network and have the full feature set that we sell. We always have stranded hardware out there that can't get our services as we sell today.","I think the history is that, that's always been true and you've always needed some backward compatible device to serve television; but the cost of those devices keeps coming down, the functionality keeps moving toward the cloud which means that the investments are getting spread out over all the customers in a much more efficient way. And the need for the set-top's capability goes down in a cloud-based environment, which means the end-user device need goes down in a cloud-based environment, which means you should have less capital intensity in the business. So, I think for a lot of reasons, including our scale opportunities to purchase capital and all the things I just said, that capital intensity is coming out of the business.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Is there an offset from more node splitting and the like that goes along with significantly higher speeds or does that just not rise to the same level of capital intensity as the more video-oriented products that you've talked about?","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's less of a factor and don't forget, as you go all-digital and you have more spectrum, essentially you can do electronic node splitting and you don't need to do the physical node splitting which an analog, video product forced you to do.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So, Chris, just one question from me, which is on the other cost line. That seems to be again up about 18% this quarter. And it was up, I think, about 13% last quarter. So if you can just help us understand the trend line for that line item going forward, that would be great. Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. It really has a lot of different categories in it and for some time, it's been elevated on a year-over-year. A lot of that historically is coming from commercial, which has had similar growth rates. That's still the case but less is that the most material driver; as we, really in the past year have gotten ready to take on a much larger set of assets although that set of assets changed upon us a few months ago. We've been really disciplined about what we put into transition expense. So meaning it's exclusively a 100% related to the integration and transition and if the transitioned and the existed would fall apart, I mean fall away, on day one.","But it doesn't mean that we haven't been positioning the company to manage a much larger set of assets through management infrastructure and getting ready to be much larger than the original set of Comcast transactions and that's carried over into today. We've not tried to pull that out and say that was transition expense because we're utilizing it on a go-forward basis. So that's one.","The second is actually property taxes in states like Montana, it's been unfavorable towards us plus the combination of having spent more capital expenditure over the past couple years means that you have a higher basis of assets, which get taxed from a property tax, on a relatively small amount of operating expense and it causes it be outsized from a percentage standpoint.","Those are the big drivers. It's a hodgepodge, there's not one signal factor that is inside there but those are the type of items that are captured in there which is a much large \u2013 a much smaller category than, of course, programming or the actual cost to service customers.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take our final question. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Can you give us some more color on \u2013 you described maybe some line extensions and things that you might do, I mean in some rural areas. Is that within your footprint or would that be adjacent to your footprint and give us some more color on that.","And, then, was there any insight to be gleaned from the conditions on the AT&T-DirecTV mergers? How the FCC maybe thinking about other video mergers such as the one you're facing, any thoughts out of that? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Yeah. No, we intend to expand our plan to passings that we don't serve today and extend physically-based competition in our line extension commitment.","In terms of the AT&T deal, it was fairly consistent with what we thought might be in it, based on public speculation and we're comfortable having seen it with our own process before the FCC and look forward to engaging with the FCC and concluding our transaction.","Frank G.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. You may begin your conference.","Stefan Anninger","Good morning and welcome to Charter\u2019s second quarter 2019 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","On today\u2019s call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Rutledge","Good morning. Our core connectivity business is strong. We continue to execute well and we continue to benefit from consolidating cable operations under our centralized operating strategy in the ways we expect it, including lower customer churn, fewer service transactions per customer and improving customer satisfaction, resulting in industry-leading growth of over 1 million customer relationships year-over-year and Internet customer growth of over 1.3 million year-over-year.","In the second quarter, we had a net gain of over 200,000 customer relationships, with customer growth of nearly 4% over the last 12 months. We added over 250,000 Internet customers. And we also added 208,000 mobile lines, accelerating as our high quality, attractively-priced mobile product is beginning to resonate with customers and penetrate the marketplace. We grew cable adjusted EBITDA by 5.4%, which combined with our lower cable capital expenditures yielded strong year-over-year cable free cash flow growth of over 50%. And that\u2019s nearly over 40% when including our investment in Spectrum Mobile. We remain focused on a number of service-oriented initiatives and we have a clear pathway to drive higher customer satisfaction and retention with positive growth and financial effects.","Our insourced and high quality workforce is driving an improved customer experience. In the second quarter, well over 90% of phone call volume was handled by our in-house agents, with billing and service-related calls down by 10% year-over-year and over 80% truck rolls were handled by our in-house field techs, with total truck rolls down nearly 7% year-over-year. Our call center virtualization plans remain on track. We\u2019ve gone from 13 billing instances to one front-end service environment, meaning better quality service and lower costs. Our self-installation program is also ramping quickly with customer self-installations now representing over 40% of our sales volume. Our online selling and service platforms are also becoming increasingly successful. All of these initiatives are having meaningful impact on our core business, including enhanced customer experience by allowing customers to interact with us on their terms either through digital platforms or highly skilled employees, reducing selling friction and service transaction volumes, all of which reduce our cost to service per customer relationship now and for many years to come.","We are using our transactional selling machine and improving brand recognition to generate sales of our Spectrum Mobile product, with the ultimate goal of driving faster overall relationship growth. With over 0.5 million Spectrum Mobile lines at the end of the second quarter, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made since launching in September of last year. In late May, we expanded the availability of our Bring Your Own Device program to all of our sales channels, with a positive impact on sales. Previously, our Bring Your Own Device program was only available by visiting select Spectrum Mobile stores. Now, customers can purchase Spectrum Mobile while bringing their own device through all of our sales channels, including our inbound, retail, online and direct channels. Later this year, we\u2019ll expand the availability of Spectrum Mobile\u2019s service to our small and medium business customers. Mobile remains a key focus of Charter and we continue to work on broadening our mobile capabilities.","We also remain focused on opportunities to continue to develop our core asset, our hybrid fiber coax wireline network and its capacity, and we have a cost-efficient pathway to do that. Our infrastructure today delivers low latency service and superior capacity and speed. And we have a scalable, relatively low cost upgrade path that allows for further low latency superiority, 10 gig symmetrical speeds with DOCSIS 4.0, also called Full Duplex, and expanded network throughput. Specifically, over time, we can expand our network from 750 megahertz to up to 3 gigahertz to meaningfully increase our total throughput and capacity, all of which positions us to continue to be the network of choice for a wide array of applications, such as gaming, 8K video, developing high capacity, low latency products such as virtual reality and medical and educational use cases. And we\u2019re doing that on a development path that is faster and more cost efficient than can be achieved by our competitors.","So, now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Turning to our results on Slide 5 of today\u2019s presentation, total residential and SMB customer relationships grew by over 1 million in the last 12 months and by 203,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, Internet grew by 258,000 units in the quarter, video declined by 141,000, wireline voice declined by 182,000 and we added 208,000 higher ARPU mobile lines. 82% of our residential customers, including Legacy Charter, were in Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the second quarter. And residential customer growth \u2013 relationship growth continued to increase to 3.4% year-over-year.","In residential Internet, we added a total of 221,000 customers in the highest seasonal disconnect quarter, just above last year\u2019s second quarter, resulting in residential Internet customer growth of 5.1% year-over-year. Both Legacy Charter and Legacy Bright House net additions were meaningfully better year-over-year in the second quarter, with residential Internet relationship growth rates of 5.9% and 7.7% respectively despite higher penetrations than the legacy TWC footprint. So, while Legacy TWC\u2019s residential Internet growth rate of 4.3% year-over-year is still good, the relative size of that footprint and the time it has taken for growth rates to mirror Charter impacts the consolidated results.","Key metrics like calls per customer, truck rolls per customer and churn are all moving in the right direction across the company and we remain confident in our ability to continue to accelerate residential customer relationship and Internet customer growth for the full year of 2019. Over the last year, our residential video customers declined by 2.5%. Similar to Internet and overall relationship churn, we benefited from a decline in total video churn year-over-year, but that was offset by lower video gross additions.","Despite some video loss, we expect to continue to grow our EBITDA and cash flow at healthy rates. And as part of a bundle, video drives Internet sales and reduces churn for our connectivity services. It remains an integral part of our business strategy for connectivity services, even as it drives less standalone profit over time. In wireline voice, we lost 207,000 residential customers in the quarter, driven by lower sell-in following our transition to selling mobile in the bundle and continued fixed and mobile substitution in the market generally.","Turning to mobile, we added 208,000 mobile lines in the quarter versus 176,000 in the first quarter of 2019, so a nice acceleration driven by growing brand awareness and expansion of our Bring Your Own Device capabilities across all sales channels, which occurred late in the quarter. As of June 30th, we had 518,000 lines with a healthy mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines. So, mobile is ramping nicely and the early results of this product launch remain promising. Over time, we not only expect Spectrum Mobile to become a meaningful driver of our connectivity sales and retention, we also expect it to be profitable on a standalone basis once it reaches scale. And beyond that, we believe that there will be opportunities to further improve the economics of our mobile business and offer unique connectivity services.","Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 884,000 or 3.4%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 0.3% year-over-year, given a lower rate of SPP migration and promotional campaign roll-off and rate adjustments. Those ARPU benefits were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, a higher mix of Choice and Stream within our video base and $24 million lower pay-per-view revenue year-over-year in the second quarter.","Slide 6 shows our cable customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 3.7%. Keep in mind that our cable ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. Turning to commercial, total SMB and enterprise revenue combined grew by 4.7% in the second quarter. SMB revenue grew by 5.3%, faster than last quarter, as the revenue effect from the re-pricing of our SMB products in Legacy TWC and Bright House continues to slow.","Enterprise revenue was up by 4%. Excluding cell backhaul and Navisite, enterprise grew by 6.7%, with nearly 10% PSU growth year-over-year. Our enterprise group is at an earlier stage of its own pricing and packaging transition, similar to what we\u2019ve done in our SMB and residential businesses over the last two years and the process of moving customers to more competitive pricing pressures enterprise ARPU in the near term.","Second quarter advertising revenue declined by 7.5% year-over-year exclusively due to less political revenue in 2019. Other revenue declined by 11.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven primarily from lower late fees and fewer delinquent accounts, which is also reflected in lower bad debt year-over-year. Mobile revenue totaled $158 million with $111 million of that revenue being EIP device revenue. In total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 4.5% year-over-year with cable revenue growth of 3.1% or 3.8% when excluding advertising and pay-per-view.","Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7, in the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $359 million or 5.3% year-over-year. Excluding mobile, operating expenses increased 1.7%. Programming increased 0.9% year-over-year due to higher rates, and that was offset by a video subscriber decline of 2.2% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages such as Choice and Stream, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year, which was roughly a 0.5% of programming growth rate impact. Despite the lower overall growth rate, our programming expense can vary and we do have some renewals in the back half of this year. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 6.7%, driven by cost of video CPE sold to customers, franchise and regulatory fees and original programing cost, in that order.","Cost to service customers declined by 0.9% year-over-year compared to 3.8% customer relationship growth. Even excluding some bad debt improvement, cost to service customers were essentially flat year-over-year. And as Tom mentioned, we are meaningfully lowering our per relationship service cost through a number of operating efficiency improvements which is core to our strategy.","Cable marketing expenses were essentially flat year-over-year and other cable expenses were up 8.4%, driven by software costs, insurance, property taxes and enterprise costs. Mobile expenses totaled $277 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to the EIP device revenue I mentioned, subscriber acquisition and usage cost and operating expenses to stand up and operate the business, including our own personnel and overhead cost and our portion of the JV with Comcast. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.4% in the second quarter, including a roughly 1.5% negative growth rate impact from 2018 political advertising revenue, net of its associated expense. And when including the mobile EBITDA start-up loss of $119 million, the total company adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.3% in the quarter.","Turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $314 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $273 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partly offset by higher interest expense, a greater non-cash loss on financial instruments and higher GAAP tax expense.","Turning to Slide 9, capital expenditures totaled just under $1.6 billion in the second quarter, with our cable CapEx declining by over $800 million year-over-year, driven by lower scalable infrastructure, primarily driven by the completion of DOCSIS 3.1 last year and the associated bandwidth benefit in 2019, lower CPE and installation CapEx due to fewer SPP migrations year-over-year and the completion of all digital in 2018. There is also the positive capital effect of increasing self-installation, lower video sales, newer average life of boxes deployed and the higher mix of boxless video outlets.","Support spending for cable was also lower driven by declining investments related to insourcing and integration, and that was partly offset by higher spend on line extensions as we continue to build out and fulfill our merger conditions. We spent $93 million in mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by retail footprint upgrades for mobile and software, some of which is related to our JV with Comcast. As a reminder, for the full year 2019, our internal plan reflects roughly $7 billion of total cable CapEx in 2019 and that\u2019s despite a lower run rate in the first half of this year.","Slide 10 shows we generated $1.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, including just under $300 million of investment in the launch of mobile. Excluding mobile, we generated $1.4 billion of cable free cash flow, up nearly $500 million versus last year\u2019s second quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by the higher adjusted EBITDA and the lower cable CapEx I mentioned. And that was partly offset by a negative cash contribution from cable working capital of $284 million during the second quarter, primarily due to continued lower payables from lower CapEx and a one-time receivables impact from standardizing our residential bill cycle time timing, and that was to simplify our bill for customers and reduce related billing increase which pushed out collections and customer payments by a few days.","Although I expect our full year change in capital, working capital to be negative, driven by the reasons we discussed on these calls, the second half of this year should have a more net neutral impact to free cash flow. And as we move beyond this 2019 calendar year, I would expect changes in our cable working capital to be neutral to beneficial to our full year free cash flow results. On the mobile side, we continue to add mobile customers, which drives handset-related working capital needs as we accelerate growth rates, and we expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future due to growth finished the quarter with $72.6 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest, including the impact of issuing investment grade and high yield notes earlier this month, is $3.9 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.4 times. We intend to stay at or below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 leverage range and we include the upfront investment in mobile to be more conservative than looking at cable-only leverage, which was 4.28 times at the end of Q2 and it\u2019s declining. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1 billion at an average price of $370 per share. Since September of 2016, we\u2019ve repurchased 21% of Charter\u2019s equity at an average price of $330 per share. So, our operating model, network capabilities, now and in the future, and our balance sheet strategy all work together over long periods of time. And we expect our results to continue to reflect a growing infrastructure asset with a lot of ancillary products to use for, and so on top of, our core connectivity services with good value and service to our customers to grow cash flow with tax-advantaged levered equity returns.","Operator, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. Hey. I wanted to ask you guys first about mobile and a couple of questions. Are you now sort of in full sales mode across the footprint in terms of devices you\u2019re supporting, or your sales channels for marketing push? I know you introduced more BYOD in May, but I just \u2013 as we think about the second half of the year, should we expect that business to continue to accelerate? And are we going to see sort of the full push on that product? And I\u2019m wondering, also as you think about profitability and your ability to use Wi-Fi offload to sort of manage your bandwidth costs and if there are opportunities to get better at that as you move through the year. And then, just a question, Chris, on CapEx, I know you reiterated the $7 billion. But I just wanted to come back because, as you mentioned, you\u2019re run-rating below that. You\u2019ve got to spend about $4 billion or accrue $4 billion in the second half to get to $7 billion. So, was just curious if maybe there \u2013 what\u2019s driving that second half step up in CapEx, given sort of we know what the sort of sub trends are? Thank you, guys.","Tom Rutledge","Alright. Ben, so are we in full sales mode? Yes. I would say we\u2019re just getting to full sales mode at the end of the second quarter. And will that accelerate our ability \u2013 will our ability to grow accelerate? Yes we think it will and that we\u2019ll continue to grow the mobile business at a more rapid rate with all of our sales channels available, with a fully supported device inventory. We are not a 100% there from devices, but we\u2019re nearly there in terms of the market share, distribution of devices. And so, we do expect the mobile business to accelerate. And we expect our ability to close sales in through our transaction volume at a higher and higher rate. In terms of bandwidth cost on Wi-Fi, I mean I think, on a relative basis, I don\u2019t expect that will improve this year on a per unit basis, but a significant portion of the traffic is already on our Wi-Fi network on a per customer basis. There are opportunities that we\u2019re experimenting with using additional spectrum like CBRS, which is also free spectrum like Wi-Fi is, and using that to offload traffic. But I don\u2019t expect that to be a meaningful contributor in 2019.","Chris Winfrey","Ben, on CapEx, if you take a look at traditional cable capital expenditure, it does tend to be back ended through the course of the year. At the end of 2018, we\u2019re coming off a pretty large investment cycle as it related to big integration projects, DOCSIS 3.1, all digital. And so, some of that has pushed out our planning and spend for this year, a little bit later than, frankly, what we had even budgeted for. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t think that the business is capable of spending it and that they\u2019re not good ROI projects and they need to get done. So, it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a challenge to get to the $7 billion. But in a sort of perverse way, we\u2019re hopeful that that can get done because it\u2019s good capital to spend and it benefits the business. So, time will tell, but for now that\u2019s still our goal is in spending at or just below $7 billion.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. Thank you, both.","Chris Winfrey","Yes. And by the way, that\u2019s for cable CapEx, just to be clear. I know I\u2019ve said it before, but\u2026.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, there were reports that you had been \u2013 that you had submitted a bid for at least certain Sprint assets. I\u2019m wondering if you can just share some insight into what assets you were interested in and if you could just add some color to that story. And then second, obviously, the bull case for your shares is, at this point, very focused on margin expansion. Your margins did expand in the quarter, perhaps not quite as quickly as some had hoped. But I wonder if you could just share some observations about the trajectory for your margins going forward, particularly given that your margins are still some 10 points lower than what are best-in-class margins in this sector now. Is there any reason why we shouldn\u2019t expect to see those kinds of numbers from you at some point down the road?","Tom Rutledge","Well, I don\u2019t want to give you any color. But you\u2019ve read a lot of reports about us over the last several months and weeks, and many of them weren\u2019t accurate. In terms of margin expansion, we are seeing margin expansion. We expected to see margin expansion, and that\u2019s occurring because of the nature of the products that are more predominant in our selling machine today. We\u2019re getting significant impacts from our cost to serve. But you can get high margins a variety of ways. You could cut your costs dramatically, but inhibit your ability to grow. And we have industry-leading growth, and so that has an impact on our margin. But we think that the free cash flow generation, by having a high growth machine in the long run, is a significantly greater asset valuation builder. So, we\u2019re not trying to be the highest margin company in the country by any means. That said, we expect our margins to continue to go to improve because, as you penetrate deeper into the market, your cost \u2013 your network costs are allocated over a bigger customer base and, therefore, your average cost per customer goes down. And the change in videos means that there is less transaction activity associated with that service, which is relatively low margin from a gross margin perspective. And the cost to serve using digital by-flows [ph] and using self-service that\u2019s now capable in an all-digital environment takes cost out of the business. So, we think the fundamental output of our business is lower capital intensity, higher free cash flow, and higher operating margins.","Chris Winfrey","Just to piggyback on what Tom said, what is our target is to be the highest free cash flow growth in the industry, not only on a gross basis, but also on a per share basis. And we feel pretty good about that opportunity given the operating strategy.","Craig Moffett","Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Okay, great. First maybe a couple of quick follow-ups on the longer-term wireless strategy for Tom, Obviously, you don\u2019t want to comment on those press reports. But have you guys looked at or are you looking at eventually providing wireless service outside your footprint? And then, as it relates to the Spectrum strategy, you guys have been active in terms of CBAD and I think it makes a lot of sense to talk about and look at the CBRS, but would you also look at Spectrum opportunities from third parties or is it just sort of CBRS and upcoming auctions? And then, one more question on video. It seems pretty clear that the pace of change in the video ecosystem is accelerating. And we\u2019ve heard from sort of a change in strategy, I would say, at Comcast and certainly at AT&T to focus more on profitability. How would you characterize your own sort of video strategy? And should we expect the mix of Choice customers and Stream customers to continue to increase from here going forward?","Tom Rutledge","So, in terms of wireless, we don\u2019t have plans today to serve outside of our footprint. As you know, we\u2019re fundamentally a regional operator and wireless companies are national companies. We do have a joint venture with Comcast, so that you have two regional companies providing, on a similar platform, wireless services nationwide. Customers who buy from us in our footprint and move out of our footprint can remain our customers. But our fundamental wireless objective today is to drive our overall customer relationships inside our physical assets using wireless and video and broadband and wired line and all new products to drive those customer relationships on the existing physical infrastructure. We Would use third-party spectrum? Of course. We are looking at CBRS. There are other opportunities to improve in specific locations, in a cost-efficient way, our ability to provide high-capacity mobile services to our customers. And we will, to the extent they develop for us, take advantage of them. Our video strategy is really today to not look at video as a standalone business. There is still a lot of value in the bundle to a lot of consumers. The problem with the bundle of video today is that the content companies that supply it have essentially put their service for free, available everywhere, through TV everywhere and excessive streams and password sharing and free over-the-air television, which can be received through antennas, all of which are unencrypted and essentially free. And it\u2019s hard to compete with free. We look at video as an attribute of our overall customer relationship. We want to have the best video services of all kinds available and make it easy for consumers to consume video on our product, but we don\u2019t look at it as a business \u2013 as a standalone business. We look at it as a attribute of the connectivity relationship that we\u2019ve established with the customer. And so, we have gross margins in that business. And I don\u2019t think we want to go underwater from a gross margin perspective. But we\u2019d look at that as a product enhancement to our connectivity, not as a standalone individual line of business.","John Hodulik","Got it. Thanks Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin","Thanks. Two quick ones for Chris. Generally, Chris, you guys generate more broadband adds in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. And I\u2019m just wondering if there is any reason why that trend wouldn\u2019t continue this year. And then, just curious, following up on \u2013 Tom, on your comment on profitability in video, the cash flow contribution from a wireless sub when you get to scale, how different is that from the cash flow contribution you get from a video sub today? Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","Second one is an interesting question. And I think how I answer that without going too deep. So, broadband, you\u2019re right, trends tend to be better in the second half of the year than the first half. There is nothing going on that would change that normal seasonality, for all the reasons that Tom spoke about earlier and I did as well. All the operating metrics are moving in the right direction and we expect to \u2013 our target and our goal is to be accelerating customer and Internet relationship growth rate for the full year. And I think that implies also doing pretty well in the second half as well. We\u2019ll see where we end up, but that\u2019s the goal. Cash flow contribution from a wireless customer once we\u2019ve reached scale. Yes, I think you have two opposing trends. When you think about cash flow contribution going all the way down to EBITDA and including the effects of CapEx, you\u2019re comparing a video business where the contribution margin is declining over time, its utility to Internet is not. But its cash flow on a standalone basis, which Tom just went through why it\u2019s not the right way to look at it. But those lines will cross. And at what point in time, I\u2019m not going to get into exactly what your models would say, but I think your premise is generally right. I would add that the mobile contribution, as the networks converge, the opportunity to move that to a higher contribution exists. And the other aspect of the mobile contribution is its pull through to the overall relationship and how significant that is. And so, you can look it as a standalone business with a margin contribution, but you can also look at it, as just described video, which is the product that you carry on a network that is ultimately an attribute of the network and drives our overall customer relationships.","Jonathan Chaplin","Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Yes, hi. Thank you. Tom, I just wanted to follow up on something you said in your prepared remarks. Can you elaborate on your plans to upgrade to 3 gigahertz. I know you said you could, but you also alluded to, like, a whole new suite of products and services. So, I guess, what\u2019s the plan, timeframe, cost and what do you \u2013 what\u2019s [indiscernible].","Tom Rutledge","Yes. Well, I would say, we just upgraded the network to 1 gig and we did that for less than $10 per home passed, and so every home passed that we currently have, which is 51 million as a 1 gig capable network sitting in front of it, and we think there\u2019s a significant amount of product development that can occur within that capacity that we\u2019re making available everywhere right now. And so, we don\u2019t have any plans to immediately upgrade our network. And in fact, because we have the 1 gig everywhere, certain costs of network development have actually come out of the business because we have so much more capacity in the network and what we call contention costs, the cost of continuously upgrading your network to make the volume of data go through it. And so, capital intensity has come out of the business as a result of the last upgrade we did. All I\u2019m saying is that we have a relatively inexpensive pathway to future services which are even hard to describe, but that can be very high capacity, very low latency, high compute, distributed high compute and we can make new products and services develop over time more efficiently than our competitors. And that is a great asset over the long term.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Jessica.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line or Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hi, thanks. Chris, you\u2019ve expressed confidence in accelerating broadband growth in the back half and you\u2019ve talked a lot about the sort of slow changes that are happening in the business. But I\u2019m still having a hard time seeing what needs to change for that to happen versus the stable broadband adds from last year this quarter? And then, second, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, but as you think about pricing, can you get this business to double-digit broadband revenue growth without taking more price, especially as video trends weaken? Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","Repeat the second question. Your question was double-digit broadband revenues or?","Philip Cusick","Yes. So, we get to double-digit broadband revenue growth as video trends weekend, and is that sort of dragging broadband down with it. Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Got it. And let me start with the first question. I think not pretty sure whether it is at your conference or whether it was on the last earnings call I mentioned, Q2 is a seasonal disconnect quarter. So, trying to evaluate the success of a multi-year strategy based on a seasonal disconnect quarter, it\u2019s a little fraught. We had a really good year-over-year in Q1. We expect accelerated customer relationship and Internet growth for the full year. I just commented; I think the back half will be better. It\u2019s also true that, during the first half of last year, we were still working through a number of different integration issues. And it\u2019s also true that churn is coming down across every single type of churn. Three major types of churn across three different companies or legacy platforms, so 9 different metrics of churn that are all going south in a good way. And so, all you need to do is maintain or increase your sales to have improved net adds. And given everything that we\u2019ve been talking about in the business, while it\u2019s not guaranteed, we\u2019re pretty confident that that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading. It doesn\u2019t mean a single quarter. It means for a year, which I think is more important than a single quarter. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading and we\u2019re pretty confident.","As it relates to double-digit broadband revenue growth, keep in mind that GAAP forces us to reallocate revenue across all these products. So, I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on a single product line looking at the revenue growth of that. What makes more the bigger difference is customer relationship growth and on the bill to the extent that we have a change in rate, either because of higher amount of single play that\u2019s coming through or because of some additional speed uptakes, which we are getting a fair amount of that going into the 400 megabit service more than we probably expected. I think the broadband business has the ability and the potential to grow at a really healthy rate for a long period of time. Whether or not with GAAP allocations that are moving across voice back into broadband and video or not, I think it\u2019s going to be healthy for a long time, and I think that\u2019s where I\u2019d leave it.","Philip Cusick","Can I clarify that for a second? it sounds like, if churn is down and units are flat year-over-year, then sales must be down as well?","Chris Winfrey","So, if you go back to what I said.","Philip Cusick","With more efficient sales, I would think margins would be better than they\u2019re showing if sales are down.","Chris Winfrey","Margins are up, what, 0.8% year-over-year in cable, and that\u2019s not a small move. And so, I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s pretty healthy and attractive. What I mentioned in the prepared remarks is, if you think about the I disclosed it because I think it matters, the growth rates, if you take a look at Legacy Charter growing in the high 5s and Bright House growing at even 7.7% and TWC growing at 4.3% is a great growth rate, but it\u2019s not where we\u2019d like to get it. And so, to your point, in the second quarter of having slightly lower sales, that was occurring in the TWC footprint. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything systemic there. We\u2019re just now hitting our stride and I think we\u2019ll look at it throughout the year.","Philip Cusick","Okay, thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Yes. And just to follow-up on that, is there any incremental color around the competitive backdrop within the legacy Time Warner footprint that we need to be thinking more about? Or is it just normal ebbs and flows in the business? Because it would seem like, with that being your biggest subsidiary, that\u2019s the biggest opportunity for a needle mover in terms of improved broadband trends. And then, just a question on the billing cycle migration or standardization, you mentioned the working capital impact. Were there any other impacts, whether it was the subscriber trends, ARPUs or anything else we should adjust for as we work through our models? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","So, Brett, Tom Rutledge. I think that the performance of all of the assets Bright House, Time Warner Cable and Charter should converge, and that\u2019s our expectation. And there\u2019s nothing that we see specific about the marketplace or the competitive environment that [indiscernible] impact. So, we think that there are still execution issues that we can improve upon as we have consolidated the company and consolidated call flow and workflow and sales flow, so that we get similar results across the platform. And that has taken us some time, but we\u2019re getting there. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll get to a kind of a converged output, which will be higher than what we have today.","Chris Winfrey","And on the billing standardization, Brett, really it\u2019s a small change, but it\u2019s just had a working capital impact. It actually has a meaningful impact on the number of billing calls that we expect to receive, so we expect a significant reduction as a result of having less service calls per churn over time. But there is no impact to ARPU. There is no impact to subs. And there is no financial impact other than the working capital that I had mentioned on the call. So, net-net, a one-time change and it should be for the long-term benefit of the company.","Brett Feldman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Mostly for probably Chris. So, obviously, there is a lot of question about margins given the sub trend. So, I just wanted to come back to a comment you made that, in second quarter, there was a 1.5% negative growth impact from advertising to EBITDA. I didn\u2019t quite understand. So, advertising had negative contribution? And so, I just want to understand that. And second, the other operating expenses, which normally grow about 5%, was up more like 8% this quarter and some property taxes and [indiscernible]. Is that the new run rate, if you can help us that? Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","Sure. So, the 1.5% EBITDA impact from advertising, that\u2019s net of the costs related to political advertisers. We\u2019re in a non-political year. And when you have political advertising last year, you don\u2019t this year. It\u2019s just to say if you didn\u2019t have political advertising impacting, the EBITDA margin for cable would have been 1.5% higher. The reason I provided that is, I didn\u2019t want people to just flow through the revenue effects without taking into account that there are some costs attached to political advertising as well. So, I think for this quarter, we wanted to provide and we\u2019ll probably do the same in Q3 and Q4 just so people can take a look at it on an apples-to-apples basis. I am sorry the second question was related to?","Vijay Jayant","Other.","Chris Winfrey","Other expenses. Yes. Oddly enough, some of that expense is actually being driven by our in-sourcing where property cash I know this is in the weeds, but it\u2019s the truth. Property and casualty insurance expense related to insourcing your labor force is flowing through us as opposed through contract labor. Now that we\u2019re towards the tail end of insourcing the labor force to the target levels, I think, over time I\u2019m not telling you Q3, Q4. I\u2019m telling you, looking out into next year and beyond, my hope is that that\u2019s not the new run rate.","Vijay Jayant","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Tom, I guess, if you look at what AT&T is trying to do in terms of bending the cost curve on programming costs and, obviously, you\u2019ve got Disney next week and Fox in the not-too-distant future, sort of at the end of the year. Do you sort of think there is an opportunity for pay TV companies to get tougher with the programmers or is that something or do you sort of take the other side of it and say, you know what, let\u2019s just keep raising the price of our video services enough, so that our dollar gross margin stays unchanged on a per customer basis. And if the programmers want to push through price increases and basically price the product out of the business, that\u2019s okay because your sort of baseline here you\u2019re a connectivity company and they\u2019re not going to get those video services any cheaper outside piracy anyway. So, any thought on just sort of video strategy around programming costs and how to manage it would be helpful?","Tom Rutledge","Well, I feel strongly both ways. And I\u2019m not really trying to be funny. I don\u2019t like raising the prices to our customers. Our customers don\u2019t know what the value where the price increase is coming from, and they attribute it to us and that affects our overall satisfaction and it affects our overall relationship and our brand equity, so to speak, with the customer. And so, I think, hitting rates and asking people to disconnect is not a very attractive way to manage the video business. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t fight with programmers to maintain some sort of price integrity for your customer, you would pass through a lot of product. So, it\u2019s a balancing act from my point of view. What I really wish is that the price value of programming wasn\u2019t being destroyed by the programmers. And the reason I say that is that, if you do a 10% programming price increase and you lose 10% of your customers, you don\u2019t really get anywhere, and yet you\u2019ve alienated a lot of people. And, in fact, that\u2019s actually happening and it has been happening. And the reason price increases aren\u2019t able to go through it and if you look at the difference between where prices have gone and where revenues have gone to content companies, they are not able to realize their price increases in their revenue line. And the reason is the product is available for free everywhere over the air, TV Everywhere, all sorts of excess streams being sold through virtual multi-channel video providers and through TV Everywhere, and there is absolutely no security on the product whatsoever. That changes the price-value relationship to customers and makes it impossible to raise prices and generate revenue. So, my wish would be that the content industry would manage their content and their copyright to their own benefit instead of pushing through price. And we still think that we have a lot of video customers and they don\u2019t want to have price increases, and so I expect continuous fighting for the foreseeable future.","Vijay Jayant","This might not be something you have at your fingertips, Tom, but you can see what people are doing on broadband. Is there any sort of quantification you can give us relative to the piracy? Or are you sort of seeing in the traffic sort of obvious increases in piracy over time?","Tom Rutledge","Yes, it\u2019s massive. And essentially, all the customers that are lost to video are still watching TV.","Vijay Jayant","Alright. Very interesting. Thank you very much. Alright. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft","Hi, good morning. I had two. The first one is a free cash flow question. Chris, as we think about mobile CapEx next year, should we expect it to continue at this, call it, little less than $100 million per quarter rate beyond this year or at some point, does it tail off as you complete infrastructure retail footprint build-out? And then, the other question I had is, if you were to build out your own wireless network capacity over licensed spectrum, would your existing MVNO agreement have to be modified? In other words, does the MVNO agreement allow you to incorporate your own network capacity into the service model and have customers switching between Verizon\u2019s network and your own? Thanks.","Chris Winfrey","So, mobile CapEx, it really is a function primarily of the retail footprint upgrade. We won\u2019t be 100% done by the end of this year. So, I think some of that will continue at least for the first half of next year, but it has a finite life attached to it. So, that CapEx is going to be largely non-recurring. There is some software development CapEx which is elevated as you get into the business and that should also come down. It won\u2019t that piece won\u2019t 100% disappear. And as it relates to the MVNO, what we talk about particularly on the last call was Tom went through is, we are testing aggressively what\u2019s called dual SIM and that, under our current MVNO, would give us, we believe, the ability and a high-quality way to offload traffic. But that comes from any small cell build that we did using CBRS or other unlicensed or licensed spectrum, that all looks really promising at this point. It would be ROI based to the extent that we work through any of that small cell build in the home, in the business or on strand. And that would have an implication a positive ROI, but it would have an implication on some CapEx associated with that, tying to your first question.","Tom Rutledge","And the other thing, Bryan, I would add to that is 80% of all the bids in the wireless mobile platform are currently being carried on our Wi-Fi network. And that\u2019s true of all the bits of all the carriers. And so, I said last time, our average customer is using over 250 gigs a month. And if you look at our average customer who is broadband only and who is still watching TV, a la the last discussion we just had, but they\u2019re watching it for free or they\u2019re paying for Netflix or some other service and watching it for free. They are using over 450 gigs a month. And so, the average cellular customer is using between 600 gigs and 800 gigs. So, you have this tremendous offload already occurring on our network and we expect that trend to continue. And we go and take advantage of it from an investment and cost of service perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the Stream products, what you are seeing there as far as the demographic that\u2019s taking it up? I presume we might know the answer. And then, maybe just frame how you think about that from a success-based standpoint, like [indiscernible] so far? And then, thinking about the plans, I know, Tom, you\u2019re talking about the 1 gig ubiquitous product. When you get into the neighborhood, what\u2019s the real experience there if we need to thinking about longer term, having all those homes guaranteed at 1 gig, what might be required from a CapEx standpoint to do that? Thanks.","Tom Rutledge","So, the Stream issue, we are selling more Stream products proportionally to video products. That\u2019s cost driven for consumers. The price of the bundle is very expensive and we talked about content companies trying to push rate buttons. And so, there are a lot of customers who can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t necessarily know how to go over the top and take it free or wouldn\u2019t consider doing that. And so, they\u2019re downgrading to Stream both from existing packages and going there from on the increment. And it\u2019s really the save money. Most consumers would like to have it all. And so, we are trying to smartly market Stream products to those consumers who are income constrained. And it\u2019s we\u2019re generally pretty good at targeting that, but it\u2019s not a perfect science. So, there\u2019s a tension between our strategies in trying to sell full packages and to sell Stream at the same time to those who are income constrained. And we\u2019re just playing the marketplace and trying to be responsive to consumers\u2019 video needs. So, I don\u2019t know where it goes. And I don\u2019t know where our contractual relationships will allow us to take it either.","With regard to upgrade and throughput in the plant, we have a lot of capacity in the plant already and we don\u2019t expect material changes in our capital trends as a result of the growth of data throughput in sort of a foreseeable future. We do think there is a long-run opportunity to create new products that can\u2019t work in today\u2019s environment for relatively small capital investments. But if you look at the current operating model, the current marketplace, we don\u2019t anticipate, even with the rate of data consumption increasing, that we\u2019re going to have any sort of outsized trend in capital required.","Mike McCormack","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. I guess one for Chris and one for Tom. So, Chris, I guess the programing expense on account of some of the new content that you\u2019re producing is on the exclusives. I think they show up in the franchise fees line and I think that number has been growing mid-single digit recently. So, how long should we expect that line to be elevated in terms of content? And, Tom, from your perspective, I think you\u2019ve expressed an interest in potentially other cable assets if they do become available. So, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on priorities relative to wireless, if there are opportunities that do come up, how do you stack up those priorities? Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","On the original content programming expense, if you take a look at, I think, what\u2019s in the Q as well as in the prepared remarks I had, it\u2019s the tiniest of all the drivers in that line. We\u2019re talking single digit millions. And that\u2019s a function of the cost of production being amortized over the life of the asset, which is typical content industry accounting. So, it\u2019s not a material driver inside of Q2 and it\u2019s not going to be significant in any way, particularly when you look at it as it relates to our programming. So, very, very small. We just mentioned it because I think it was the third or fourth largest driver in that category.","Tom Rutledge","And so, your second question about what\u2019s more important from an asset perspective if you\u2019re doing M&A, look, I think the cable business is a great business and I think it\u2019s well positioned to be the connectivity infrastructure going forward and has cost opportunities that can\u2019t be easily replicated and, therefore, makes it a wonderful business that allows you to move massive capacity through it and it\u2019s fully deployed. And I think there are scale advantages to having more cable. And so, I would look at the cable asset as the most valuable asset. We don\u2019t have any need today to do any wireless M&A and I don\u2019t know that I would do any if it were available. Obviously, it depends on what it costs, but the cable business is the predominant distribution vehicle for data even in a mobile environment because, as you think about the future of mobile, the cells are very small. We already are a small cell provider through our Wi-Fi platform. And as other small cell technologies become available, we have a fully distributed high capacity, easy to upgrade, efficient to upgrade network pretty much everywhere on the streets and byways and that gives \u2013 makes the cable business a great business.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you.","Chris Winfrey","Thank you.","Tom Rutledge","Thanks everyone for being on the call today.","Operator","Thank you.

Except for the third quarter of 2016, and unless otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to on this call are pro forma for the transactions as if they had closed at the beginning of the earliest period of reference. Please also note that all growth rate noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thank you, Stefan. Since the closing of our transaction in May, we have been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrated.","In late September, we began deploying our marketing strategy in the Time Warner Cable footprint, including Texas and California. That process includes launching new service \u2013 new pricing and packaging, and the rebranding of our services as Spectrum.","As a result, we are already seeing better sales in those markets. As expected, these launches in September had little effect on Q3 results. However, later this month, we will roll out Spectrum in our New York City and Florida markets. By year-end, we will have branded over 50% of our service area as Spectrum.","We expect to be through all of Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets by the spring of next year, with customers and financial growth benefits following over time, like they have at pre-deal Charter.","On the small and medium business size, we will launch full Spectrum SMB pricing and packaging and Time Warner Cable and Bright House passings in mid-2017. Similar to residential, we will offer SMB products that are better than what the telcos offer at lower prices, driving customer growth in the same way we have at pre-deal Charter since launching SMB pricing and packaging in early 2015.","We are just beginning to modify business practices, policies, and processes, which take time, and our goal is to avoid service disruptions. In-sourcing 20,000 employees will require upfront investments to train, house, and equip our own personnel. There will be a period of time when the productivity of those workers will be relatively low, preventing us from immediately reducing our outsourced workforce.","Over time, however, the productivity of our insourced employee base will grow, and transactions will decline, allowing us to change our insource service mix faster. So we will invest more in each customer transaction, driving higher-quality work. That higher-quality work drives transactions out of the business, lowering transaction costs per dollar of revenue and per customer relationship.","The operating and financial results of our strategy have been demonstrated at pre-deal Charter, and we expect the same type of results for the new company. We will also complete the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House over the next two years.","Separate from the integration, we remain focused on product and network development. Over the next five years or so, with relatively small infrastructure investments, our network will be able to deliver symmetrical multi-gigabit speeds with high compute and low latency capabilities to all 50 million homes and businesses in our footprint.","In addition to residential and SMB offerings, we will serve the enterprise marketplace with increasingly sophisticated and advanced products. The opportunity is meaningful, and our addressable footprint is approximately $20 billion of annual enterprise spend and today, we are capturing less than 10% of that spend. There is also large opportunities for us in the advanced advertising space. Our two-way interactive plant allows for highly efficient household addressability, and we are testing new platforms which will allow advertisers to better target, measure, and reach consumers at the household level.","Finally, mobility remains an area of significant opportunity for Charter and the cable industry more broadly. We are already a significant wireless provider through our in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi footprint, and we intend to activate our MVNO agreement with Verizon. In the near term, our goals with mobility are to drive more customer growth and extend customer life by offering an attractively priced product bundle.","Over the long term, our goals will broaden. We believe there will be opportunities for us to develop new services as higher-frequency spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, becomes available. Ultimately, our goals are consistent for any new businesses that we develop, to grow our overall business more quickly and to drive more shareholder value.","Before I turn the call over to Chris Winfrey, who will cover the quarter in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had a very strong quarter of financial results. We grew revenue by over 7% year-over-year and EBITDA growth of over 14% in part driven by transaction synergies, which are quickly benefiting our P&L, but also driven by the continued strength of our core operations at Legacy Charter.","Third quarter customer results were more inconsistent with good performance at Legacy Charter and Bright House, but higher churn and downgrades in the Time Warner Cable markets, as we expected, given the way Time Warner Cable had marketed promotional pricing. Until our Spectrum pricing and packaging is launched across the newly acquired service areas, we continue to expect higher levels of churn and downgrades where Time Warner Cable was the operator.","Pre-deal Charter results continue to reflect the multi-year effect of our operating plans, including 6.2% residential and SMB customer growth over the last 12 months, with 9.7% internet customer growth, 70,000 video net additions and 7.2% revenue growth without relying on rate increases. At the same time, service transactions and churn in those areas continue to come down. So our growth plan is working and our integration remains on or ahead of schedule. Nothing we have seen internally or externally has changed our optimism regarding our long-term business opportunities and growth prospects.","Chris, I'll turn the call to you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. On our last quarter's call, I spent a lot of time discussing the effect of purchase accounting on our financials and the presentation of pro forma results. So I won't go through all of that again, but last quarter's presentation and transcript regarding accounting items remain helpful to investors.","As Stefan mentioned, I'll refer to the third quarter 2016 actual results versus prior year pro forma results, as comparisons to third quarter 2015 actuals aren't so helpful. The customer passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions. And in a few quarters' time, we'll recap customer data and the trending schedules using the same common definitions. Until then, certain takeaways, penetration and ARPU remained relevant for the legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful in comparing one entity to another.","Turning to customers and PSUs. During the third quarter, total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, including 4.5% at Legacy TWC, 6.2% at Legacy Charter and 5.9% at Legacy Bright House. As slide 8 shows, we grew residential PSUs by 336,000 versus 605,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was primarily driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, partly due to a low-price voice offer in TWC markets in prior year quarters, which is now resulting in higher voice downgrades and relationship churn.","Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by about 0.5%, pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 1.2%, and Bright House lost about 2.6% of its residential video customers.","Quarterly video customer performance improved year-over-year at pre-deal Charter and at Bright House, while TWC video net loss was 54,000 worse than last year, primarily driven by an increase in video downgrade activity, given Legacy pricing and packaging issues. So in total, we lost 47,000 residential video customers in the quarter, primarily driven by the losses at TWC.","In residential internet, we added a total of 350,000 customers versus 369,000 last year. Our total residential internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers, or 8.2% over the past year. In voice, we grew customers by 33,000 versus 256,000 last year, largely driven by higher churn at TWC for the reasons I already mentioned.","Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million or by 4.8%. And over the same period, residential revenue per customer was up by about 1.8%, nearly all of which was driven by TWC rate increases early in the year and step-ups which impacted unit growth.","Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 6.7%. Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined, grew by 12.1%, a bit slower than last quarter, driven by lower cell tower growth and one-time benefit at NaviSite last year. Finally, advertising was up 12.1%. And, absent political, advertising revenue grew roughly 2%. In total, third quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 7.4% year-over-year.","Looking at total revenue growth by each of our Legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 7.7%, with nearly half of residential growth still coming rate. Pre-deal Charter grew by 7.2%, driven predominantly by continued customer growth. And Bright House revenue grew by 6.6%, where their Florida markets continued to do well.","Within operating expense, in both current and historical periods, we've reclassified a number of operating expense items between lines. And as I mentioned last quarter, we do expect some ongoing remapping of our expenses as we move expense categories to the correct business unit in our operating structure.","Total operating expenses grew by $234 million, or 3.8% year-over-year, with transition expense accounting for $32 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 8.2% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by transaction synergies. I expect our programming line and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by Q4, or at least by Q1.","Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were down about 3% year-over-year, in part due to the purchase accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I discussed last quarter.","The Dodgers' right costs are only expensed during the regular MLB season, both in the past and today. Cost to service customers declined by about 2% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which reflects lower service transactions at Legacy Charter, the lack of all-digital activity at TWC this quarter versus last year's third quarter, and some benefit from less physical disconnects in all-digital markets.","And other expenses grew by 7.9%, driven by higher corporate and administrative labor costs, including advertising sales costs, enterprise sales, and higher year-over-year IT spend at Legacy TWC.","The expense was partly offset by overhead reductions. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash share-based compensation, grew by 14.5%. And excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.1%. That growth includes continued growth in Legacy Charter, excluding synergies, at a level well above revenue growth. And absent transaction synergies and merger accounting effects and labor for all-digital center TWC in 2015, consolidated Charter adjusted EBITDA was probably growing just above the total revenue growth rate.","We have identified nearly $90 million of hard transaction synergies realized within the third quarter, which had a positive impact on the financial statements and was growing through the quarter. As various small projects have naturally come under review, there are additional benefits outside of the $90 million inside the quarter to the income statement, some of which could drive sustainably lower spend on discretionary initiatives, which will be harder to track definitively, and some of which may just be a temporary pause.","Going the opposite direction, some overhead groups continue to be double-staffed as we prepare to transition systems and processes starting in Q4 and for many areas like billing, provisioning, IT, and engineering, that will persist into 2017.","So net-net, those puts and takes will continue for a while, but there were roughly $350 million of annualized hard transaction synergies already in the Q3 numbers, and we have concretely identified $700 million in run rate transaction synergies, which should be achieved at the first anniversary of the closing. The amounts and quality of these estimates continues to improve with time, and we continue to expect to significantly exceed the $800 million target after three years.","Legacy Charter, without any synergy benefit, continues to be a good proxy for how we expect subscribers and financials to develop once our Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed. Over the next few quarters, our operating results will reflect reversing certain product and packaging strategies, in particular at TWC, in which in our view are not sustainable, given high promotional roll-offs and annual rate increases, high customer equipment fees, including modem fees, all coupled with complex and stacked offers.","Our goal is to transition to new pricing and packaging in a revenue-accretive manner. But the revenue growth rate at TWC will probably be lower until Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed, relationship growth accelerates, and a systematic approach to roll-offs and retention are in place.","In addition, we expect to spend more OpEx for service operations and capital for all-digital through 2018, similar to Legacy Charter. But what will be different than the Legacy Charter experience is that we will have transaction synergies and growth from Legacy Charter operations to finance much of that incremental spending. And there is more on the TWC and Bright House base that's already been digitized, and we have lower unit cost on boxes.","Turning to net income on slide 11, we generated $189 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $2 million on a pro forma basis last year, with the growth driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on financial instruments from currency movements on our British pound debt and related hedging. That was partly offset by transaction-related expense, including severance expense and higher depreciation and amortization driven by purchase price accounting step-ups.","Turning to slide 12. Capital expenditures totaled $1.75 billion, including $109 million of transition spend. Excluding transition CapEx, our third quarter CapEx was down by $36 million year-over-year, about 2%, driven by one all-digital spending at TWC, primarily on CPE, which did not recur in the third quarter of this year; two, prior-year support capital spending at TWC, including real-estate investments and network facilities, both of which were offset by investments in product development, which fall into scalable infrastructure. Looking ahead, we expect our annual capital spending to rise once we restart all-digital in 2017.","As slide 13 shows, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter versus $208 million of actual, not pro forma free cash flow in the third quarter of last year. That growth was largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, given the close of our transactions. And although we don't provide pro forma free cash flow for the third quarter of 2015, on a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA, less CapEx, grew by 28% in the third quarter versus the prior year.","We finished the third quarter with $60.2 billion in principal amount of debt. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense was $3.3 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate. The P&L difference to cash stems from the revaluation of acquired TWC debt on our GAAP balance sheet as part of purchase accounting.","As of the end of the third quarter, our total net debt to last 12 month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times. Our long-term target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and we continue to target the lower end of that range. We are de-leveraging rapidly, and we can use that excess capacity in a number of ways. The priorities remain investment in the business, accretive M&A when available or returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.","During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million Charter shares for $281 million at an average price of about $267 per share. Share repurchase activity will continue to depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. And we will be opportunistic, similar to what we did in 2011, where we provided liquidity in size at a fair price to institutional sellers. Our goal is to retain full strategic flexibility and not become trapped by formulaic capital allocation guidance on buybacks.","Finally, turning to our tax assets on slide 15, we estimate that the total value of those assets is in excess of $6 billion and is comprised of our excess basis, large NOLs, and a valuable tax-sharing agreement with Advance\/Newhouse.","We don't currently expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pre-tax income, excluding the impact of higher D&A from purchase accounting, should be below statutory rates for seven years thereafter.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Your first question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I just had a quick question regarding some of the over-the-top sort of linear offers that are out in the marketplace and more that are coming. What strikes me as unusual about them is the relatively low ARPUs. And I was just wondering, as you guys assess the competitive landscape, do you view those as sort of below their marginal cost, or is there something that you are aware of like fixed-price contracts or something like that that makes those retail ARPUs that are going to be in the marketplace maybe not indicative of the long-run price points? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Jason, this is Tom. From what I have seen, the descriptions of the product sets are consistent with the price. And so I don't think they are below price. But I also don't think they are full packages, as I have seen them described.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So, like, for example, I mean, DTV Now is out there at $35. It looks like a pretty robust offer. What would be the thing that you think makes that sort of missing? What is missing from that lineup relative to your video offering?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I don't think all the broadcast signals are in it.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Is there anything else that you think will be missing?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, I can't say I know off the top of my head everything that is in it, but...","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, all right. But the way you are assessing the marketplace is ...","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","But what's in it, what I have seen is in it is \u2013 doesn't add up to the price. So I think it does have some margin in it.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, thank you. Two questions on wireless, if I could. One, just a clarification, you said that you were going to trigger the MVNO with Verizon. Has Verizon confirmed the full availability of the MVNO, the transferability from TWC to a new owner? And, if so, are there any restrictions on the footprints that you can use it in?","And then, second, so you disclosed that you started buying back stock. Is there any interaction between spending that you might do on wireless and the rate at which you repurchase shares? I saw an SEC filing in which you indicated some expectation of having your own facilities in wireless.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So to the first question, we've had fruitful discussions with Verizon, but I don't want to characterize them beyond that.","And with regard to our licenses, yes, we've asked the SEC for the right to experiment with what people call millimeter wave technologies in several markets so that we can learn how to use those products to our advantage competitively.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","I think, Craig, at this point, from a cash flow perspective, whether you think about the MVNO or some advance testing, this is not at a stage where it's material at all to cash flow.","And so, again, we're not going to trap ourselves with buyback guidance, because we're always going to look for ways to reinvest in the business or apply it to more accretive M&A to the extent it exists. But that hasn't factored into our thinking right now as a significant source of capital yet in the short term.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","All right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, we'll take our next question, please?","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Just a clarification. When you roll out Spectrum, it feels like investors are anticipating a big negative in terms of ARPU or revenue per customer relationship. Can you just talk to that a little bit more?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","It didn't happen at Charter, and we went through the exact same process. So Legacy Charter, when, in 2012, we went through this before, had high-priced boxes, low-value products. And it meant that maybe the ARPU lift for customer relationship wasn't as high as it could have been if you were banging on rates, but our growth took off. And I think people are focusing on the wrong thing of trying to focus on the ARPU as opposed to talking about customer relationship growth. And that's the real value of the growth strategy over time as opposed to how much rate can you take.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then when you talk about opportunistic and accretive M&A, we're assuming that you don't have anything imminent in mind and it would most likely not be content, but more something tuck-in to help your strategy.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","You'd like us to lay out our M&A strategy here.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And what's imminent.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Look, if we had anything that was material and probable, we'd have to disclose it here. That's about the best I can say.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. A follow-up first and then a question. Chris, I know you don't want to get trapped into guiding on the buyback. But you talked about providing liquidity to the market in the past, whereas this time, you were buying in what was a fairly high period of demand at relatively high prices. How do you think about the buyback in terms of being opportunistic? And how did the board come up with the $750 million over a six-month period?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, I don't know that I should be getting into our board's thinking, but that was the number that we got. And obviously, management like as much flexibility as we could have. The opportunistic part means in 2011 there were periods of disruption where institutional investors approached us and we were able to provide them liquidity. There's all the other traditional ways of going back and buying back stock, whether there's high market demand, low market demand. At the end of the day, it's just a view on what you think the growth profile of the company is and where the stock will be several years out as opposed to the next few months. If you have views on what you think the stock is worth over a multi-year period, does it look attractive? And we thought it did, and we executed on some buybacks under that authority.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And second, CapEx this quarter, fairly low. I think you talked about delaying the all-digital migration. Should we expect that to be up a little bit in 4Q as you get ready for more digital conversions? And then if you can give us any preview on 2017, where it might be versus the $6.9 billion that was outlined in the proxy? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah, the proxy was based on a business plan of nearly two years ago. So, frankly, I don't even remember what the number was. There's nothing that's changed in our thoughts about the trajectory of CapEx over time. But we closed six months later, and if we see opportunities to pull investment in faster, we will. So I don't want to be tethered to what we were laying out then. The trajectory is the same.","And for 2017, I don't even know how much we're doing in terms of all-digital in 2017 versus 2018. That's going to be one of the large drivers. So we're not going to get into the mode of being trapped by that CapEx guidance either. But we expect the capital intensity to decline over time once we get through the all-digital.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah, we haven't actually done our budget yet, so we don't know what we're going to spend in 2017.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, we'll take our next question, please?","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Chris, just going back to the synergy and investments, maybe you can help us think about the cadence. On the programming cost side, are you basically recognizing or have you already gotten all of the benefit from rolling to Time Warner Cable's rate card? You talked about fourth quarter being a little more of a normalized number. Maybe you could just give us some color as to why.","And on the other side of it, your slide \u2013 can't remember the number, that shows insourcing, it looks like the insourcing has started. I don't know if you can give us a sense, even qualitatively, as to how far along you are in terms of hiring those 20,000 people or if most of that's still ahead of us. And then I have a follow-up for Tom.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. So, look, we're intentionally not getting into it line by line as it relates to the synergy targets or what's been realized because, frankly, from an investor perspective, I don't know that it matters that much. So there's one thing to talk about, the one-time synergy and other thing is to talk about the growth curve and programming cost once you've had that synergy over a multi-year period. And those are really distinct items.","So for all the obvious reasons, we're not going to go line by line. I think, the key thing for investors to understand is that we started off, I think, when we announced the transaction, thinking it would be around $400 million in the first year \u2013 at the end of the first year annualized.","When we financed it, it was at $500 million. Last quarter, it was at $600 million. This quarter, we are confirming that it is $700 million at the end of year one run rate and that we're going to significantly exceed the $800 million original target for the run rate at the end of three years. So that's what really matters, and that's what different from Charter, is going to help us fund a lot of the investments that we're doing and have a slightly different net growth curve financially for the new company.","From a programming expense line perspective, I guess the only thing I would tell you is, one, even though you step into a rate card that has nothing to do \u2013 that doesn't give you any indication of what the slope was and the growth rate could continue to be high on the rate card you stepped into. But we're not accruing against the contractual rate card which we're billing. Beyond that, I'll just leave it at that. And for all the obvious reasons, we're not going to go much deeper into the topic.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And any color on how many of those heads have been brought in already that we are seeing in the P&L?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","No. I think, this is more about changing the activity and rerouting along the way. We talk publicly about the fact that we are already building call centers and we were doing that rapidly. So that process has started, but it is very early on, which is the intent of that very light shading on the \u2013 I don't know what page it is in the presentation, but we did give a page that is designed to show the progression of all the different operating initiatives as we see it today.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Got it. And then just Tom, going back to your comments on enterprise, we hear that a lot from a lot of the cable operators and it's obviously a big opportunity but also one that I don't think we've seen anyone really crack the code on yet.","Do you believe you can build all the expertise and product offering, sales force, et cetera to go after enterprise meaningfully? Or do you think you need to buy assets, either network assets or expertise to really capture that when you look at it what seems to be, I think, you said a $20 billion opportunity in your footprint?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I do think we can build it. And I think that we can change the definition of the product set that works in that marketplace as well, coming at it from a non-incumbent perspective.","But one of the advantages of the new company and the new footprint is the regionality that has been picked up in terms of our asset base, previously Charter was less of a percentage of DMA in most markets that we operated in. And as a result of that, we had marketing inefficiencies. We couldn't use mass media in a lot of places. And the same effect actually impedes enterprise growth because of the regional nature of a lot of enterprises and the multi-site facilities that larger enterprises have and the inability to serve those consistently when you have a spindly footprint.","And so the improvement in the footprint actually improves the opportunity that the enterprise market presents to us, as well as the fact that it's -- I mean the big news is we have great technologies. We have the ability to put those technologies everywhere we operate and we're really underpenetrated. And to me that lots of upside.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. So just referring to your presentation on page four, based on the timeline set out there, it sort of appears that your KPI gross ads should start increasing starting in 4Q, although you still have the churn associated with Time Warner Cable, as you called out.","And then, ARPU step-ups should start really in 4Q 2017, given the step-ups that we expect. But sort of looking at your insourcing, it sort of looks like three years, but where in that cycle does the duplicate cost start rolling off? Because from what I remember on the heritage Charter timeline, it was like a six-quarter period for elevated costs. Is that similarly the arc we should be thinking about for the new integration?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah. So, Vijay, you are going to \u2013 I'd love to lay out our own model for you here, but I can't. I think, the \u2013 what I would tell you is that the fourth quarter comment you made about volume significantly ramping already in the fourth quarter is \u2013 I don't see that in the cards.","Most of what we are doing for Spectrum pricing and packaging isn't beginning until mid-November and then continuing through December. So as that soaks through the marketplace, and even then, it's only half of the acquired footprint that would have been taken through Spectrum pricing and packaging. So I think we would be getting ahead of ourselves.","I think, it's fair to start looking at the business and thinking about it conservatively once Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed across all the markets. And that's the right time to start thinking through. Already, where we have gone as Spectrum pricing and packaging, we are seeing uplift in sales, and it is material, and it is what we would expect, and it is what we saw at Charter.","As it relates to these different initiatives that you described on the OpEx side, you know, the curve could look a lot like Charter. Offsetting that is going to be the fact that we have transaction synergies here which we did not have in the previous Charter experience which will buffer that.","And in addition to that, you have legacy Charter, which is still a large portion of the footprint that's growing at a very fast pace, not just from customer relationships. And -- but because our service transactions are coming down, our EBITDA growth, last time that we could really look at it on a completely standalone basis, far outstrip the revenue growth. I mentioned that was without taking a bunch of rate.","So I'm going to say it again. I know everybody is focused on how much ARPU can you get, but this isn't an ARPU-driven strategy. It's a customer growth driven strategy, and it's one that's designed to take transactions out of the business. We did get some ARPU growth over time at legacy Charter. I think that will happen here too. But that's not going to define our success one way or another.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes, it's really revenue per passing that you are looking at.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Correct. And that's achieved through higher pre-issues per household and higher penetration per product and customer relationship growth. Those are the ones that matter.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","And if I could just follow-up on Spectrum Guide rollout on the heritage Charter, how is that going? And are we downloading both on VOD and IP, and is it scaling and all of that? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Is that the UI question?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Yes.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes, look, we're rolling that out across the historic Charter footprint, and we're prepared to roll out next year inside the new price and packaging rollouts, not at the beginning of the year, but more towards the middle of the year. And we will \u2013 that will become our standard user interface on every incremental sale that we make. And it will also be an opportunity for our existing customer base to change out, without a change in hardware, their UI based on whatever need they might have and whenever they might want to make that occur. So it's going well, and it's being rolled, and it is our game plan.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you. First a follow-up on the buyback question. You guys did $280 million in the buyback versus $1 billion in cash flow. Should we think of the $750 million authorization as sort of a cap on repurchases between now and when you restart the all-digital? And maybe if you could talk \u2013 I know, you want don't want to get caught in the formulaic sort of equation here, but maybe the pacing on finishing that $750 million or does the board look at this sort of periodically? I would imagine there are some people on the board that really like buybacks.","And then, secondly, on the sub losses, you said that you would see the dislocation in Time Warner Cable through the repackaging and re-pricing. Do things get better or worse from here? Is there some hump that we get over, or is this 60,000 number a good number going forward for that time being? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","We may have to come back to the second question. I am not sure I could totally follow it. But the \u2013 on the first question, you'll see in the 10-Q that we file today that the board is authorized to start the clock anew following this Q3 earnings for the six month window with the $750 million authorization. So effectively a reset. And so we continue to have, as we sit here today, $750 million available to us to be opportunistic over time.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And on the subs, you said there would be dislocation on the Time Warner Cable properties until you finish the pricing and packaging. Is the level of losses that we saw this quarter about right through that period, or is there anything in terms of your plan that suggests it might get a little bit worse or get better through that period?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","No. We're working on ways of moderating that simultaneously to the rollout of pricing and packaging. So even if we weren't rolling out pricing and packaging, which had a positive benefit to churn, we've done other things in our whole relationship process, which is difficult to do during a transition process, but we're making changes where we can to the benefit of the consumer and trying to preserve the customer base while we rollout new pricing and packaging.","So I wouldn't say that the number this quarter is a proxy for all future quarters until pricing and packaging is rolled out. But pricing and packaging will be fully rolled out by spring. And the question, then, is how fast does that flow through the business in a corrective way. But if you look at what we did at Charter, a substantial amount of the customer base turns over every year into new pricing and packaging through both churn activity and through upgrade activity.","And so it's a difficult thing to model. But we're coming at it both ways, both from creating a value proposition in the pricing and packaging we have, and doing those smart things that you can do with an existing customer base that's mispriced to move them in the right direction.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on something Tom said in the opening remarks. Tom, you talked about testing addressable advertising. Can you give us some color on what your plans are there and when you'll actually scale up? Your advertising numbers are already probably better than anybody. But what is it that you're planning and how big can it be?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, we have ambitions to make it a bigger business. And it's good right now. It's a political season, obviously. But in terms of the new company, we'll immediately start selling data-infused advertising in 2017. And we believe that that will give us a lift over our historic pattern of advertising growth because our products will be worth more to our advertising. And we have a whole series of products that go forward from that. But, essentially, we have the ability to put ads where we want to put them and to who we want to put them. And that capability should create a different value relationship with advertisers.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just a separate follow-up. Just a little bit of focus on wireless today. What do you think the timing to come to market will be with the wireless product?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, as we go down the path of an MVNO, it doesn't mean that we launch in an immediate fashion. It's a substantial business and requires significant planning and I would think that it would be well toward the end of the year, if not the following year, before the business is actually substantial, meaning end of 2017, following into 2018.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. Just to follow-up on the last question on wireless. When you say that it would probably be the end of 2017 into 2018 before the business is substantial, are you thinking in terms of before you've got a significant number of customers, or it will take you that amount of time to roll an offering out across your entire footprint?","And then I'm wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail about how the economics of the product evolved from what it looks like with the MVNO to where you think it goes as you begin to be able to leverage 5G capabilities in conjunction with the wireless product.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Well, I think to answer your question, it's the latter. It's really just standing up the business that I was talking about, not having a substantial customer count. And with regard to where it goes, I think the MVNO is an opportunity to create a high-quality product intermixed with our existing high-quality products and create value for customers. And that has a tremendous potential to make the existing business model work better.","With regard to how that gets integrated, no, I think 5G-type technologies or millimeter wave technologies or small cell, high frequency, high capacity, low latency wireless networks are products that we will develop. They may or may not be connected to an MVNO relationship or a mobility relationship. I think that there are opportunities to create wireless drops in certain cases, so direct wireless connections that mimic a physical connection, to connect malls and other things in the enterprise space and buildings that are not contiguous or have big parking lots or, in some cases, low density areas, it might make some sense.","And so the technology platform of these small high-capacity cells can work in a myriad of ways, both as line extension devices, as well as in-home devices that don't necessarily require mobility off property, in-office devices that don't require mobility off property. So they don't have to be necessarily developed as a mobile service. So we're going to explore both paths.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me. First, on programming cost, Chris, there's been a little bit of a difference between your trajectory and Comcast, and I'm guessing some of that is just the renewal cycle being different. But is there also any differences in terms of content portfolios? Comcast has been public about having full stacking rights and having the top 100 shows on TV and so on. So is there some differences in terms of what you guys are going for in terms of programming costs, which is defining some of the trajectory?","And, secondly, Tom, from a competitive pressure perspective, we are seeing a lot more news flow about companies like Google and potentially Amazon and, of course, the DirecTV Now kind of packages coming in. How are you thinking about competition from the virtual over buildouts potentially in your footprint going forward? Thanks.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I'll answer the first question. I think the more likely difference, since we don't know what Comcast programming agreements cost or what they are, is still timing, if you're trying to compare the two companies, trajectory in any one fiscal year, because it is a lumpy kind of business. But that's speculative, without having any real information other than my experience.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","And the transaction synergies that we have already.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","So....","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yeah.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So just as a follow-up on that, is it fair to say that over time, as the renewal cycles catch up, the trajectory maybe over a four-year or a five-year period looks similar?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","They tend to converge over a longer period of time historically, whether they're seeking different rights than us or not, I don't know.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So if there were different rights structures and people were paying different amounts for those, and the industry practice is diverged, that wouldn't be true. But historically, it is true that they tend to converge over time. With regard to competition, how do we think about it? We think we have a great physical infrastructure and that it's underpenetrated, and that we have tremendous growth in front of us. We take our competitors seriously. We try to build better products than they do. And we think that we'll be able to continue to do that for the foreseeable future. We think we'll win based on our pricing, packaging, and product mix. We think we'll win based on our service business. And we think that the network that we have is underdeveloped in terms of its capabilities.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Operator we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Okay. Your next question will come from Jeff Wlodarczak from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Good morning guys. A couple for Tom. Following up on that last question, how important is it for you all to offer additional skinnier TV packages, and where are you on launching those type of offerings? And then, the FCC recently had a ruling on ISP data privacy. What are likely effects on you all from that ruling?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So with regard to skinny packages, generally, the product sets that people offer in the market that are less than full services are available to us. And we've done experiments, although interestingly, the rate of customers that take full packages from us is increasing. So we're growing our video business and the ratio, the mix of full-service product, what people would think of as a fat package, I guess, is actually increasing. So when we look at our opportunity, if we think there's a niche of market that could work with the products that are available, and they all have limitations in terms of being targetable to the non-subscribing marketplace, which generally is lower income and out of the full-package market because of their income.","And so we have the ability, I think, to continue to compete in that space if a product becomes available to us that actually satisfies a segment of the marketplace that's currently un-served.","So far, we haven't found that magic mixture. We have sold some skinny packages ourselves. We continue to sell them. But the mix is actually going heavier. So I think about it as an evolving landscape. To the extent that content companies want to let us sell in smaller packages that have lower penetrations, we'd be glad to take advantage of that.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And then, the FCC's ruling on ISP data processing?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Oh, sorry. Look, it was worse than it ended up. And we'd rather not have an inconsistent regulatory environment for us as ISPs relative to edge providers. And we think that's really long, but it came a lot closer to the FTC model, not the FCC model, as originally proposed. And it's better, not perfect, but it's better.","Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Got it. Thanks very much, guys.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, everybody. That's it for our call. See you in next quarter.","Thomas M.

This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter of 2012, we delivered revenue growth of nearly 5% year-over-year, increased adjusted EBITDA 2.7% and generated free cash flow of $26 million. Video relationships declined reflecting typical seasonal second quarter seasonality, but the trend for all products improved compared to the prior year. Our fundamental objectives haven't changed since we last reported, we're enhancing our video product and overall customer experience using our superior Internet product, coupled with video and voice to drive relationships and growing our commercial business.","As we entered the second half of 2012, we improved our product set, particularly video. We accelerated the expansion of our HD offering with over 100 channels now available in substantially all of our footprint. We will progressively go all-digital in the next 2 years, and since April, we're actively selling digital only. And we want that digital experience on each TV set and an HD on every HD set. With the changes we've made, Charter now has a strong video product relative to any other video provider.","In addition, our Internet offer now starts at 30 meg, a speed that is 10x faster than DSL and faster than U-verse can go as currently constructed. And we packaged it in a high-value offering that ensures that rich experience on each TV and drives uptake of all 3 products, including our fully featured voice products, all at an attractive price.","The goals of our new pricing and packaging strategy are: To drive deeper penetration of our services into the home with a simple compelling offer structure; drive higher ARPU per connect, which will increase over time; lower our transaction cost per customer by reducing customer touch points and number of follow-on transactions; extend customer lifetime through lower churn; and ultimately, increase operating cash flow and drive return on investment.","In the short term, customer connects, revenue and operating expenses will be impacted by the transition to new selling methods and operating practices, and we expect to see some pressure in the second half of this year. In addition, our capital spend will reflect that higher growth and deeper product penetration in the home, but the increase will be entirely success-based.","In the last quarter, we increased our CPE spend to ensure that we were ready to accommodate higher anticipated set-top box placements in third and fourth quarters. I'm pleased to say that we're seeing success with our new strategy. It's still very early, but thus far, we've seen a much higher uptake on Triple Play, with the sell-in rate on video connects more than doubling. At the beginning of the third quarter, we also implemented a number of changes designed to enable us to operate more effectively, to provide our customers with better service and to improve our ability to roll out new products over time. We reorganized field operations into 4 regions, with a shift in responsibilities and accountability to better service our customer's needs. We're centralizing our network management structure to ensure consistent service levels and change management throughout our operations. We've revamped our go-to market strategy from targeting to selling methods, and we're continuing to focus on improving the service we provide our customers in all aspects of the business which is critical. Whether it's sales, marketing or field operations, we're making a series of structural and tactical changes which I expect will have a cumulative effect on better service, lower churn and higher sales. And of course, we continue to focus on product development, but near term, our main objectives are to run a top-notch operation, deliver high-value competitive packages and provide high quality customer service. This will take time, but it is designed to drive sustainable, long-term growth and has a clear, demonstrated return on investment.","I'll now turn it over to Chris to give more details on the second quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, looking at Q2 customer and ARPU trends on the residential slide. Video customers decreased 66,000 in the second quarter, an improvement over last year's Q2 decline of 79,000. In addition to seasonality, as Tom mentioned, we ceased active marketing of analog service during the quarter. This had some short-term impact on video customer acquisition, but offering a fully featured video service will benefit us long term.","We grew Internet customers by 29,000, some 60% higher than the gain in the prior year's second quarter as we continue to see success with our superior data product, and we're making it even more competitive.","For phone, we added 6,000 customers during the quarter. It's early on, but we're seeing very positive phone results in Q3 from the new pricing and packaging.","In the second quarter, Charter generated top line growth of $85 million or 4.7% year-on-year shown on Slide 5. In the residential business, year-over-year grew Internet revenue 10.2% driven by a 291,000 increase in customers and modest ARPU uplift.","We increased phone revenue 1.9% driven by 75,000 customer additions, offset by slightly lower ARPU year-over-year. I expect this rate volume trend to deepen under our new offer structure. The focus is on ARPU per customer relationship and single product ARPU become increasingly relevant to evaluating performance.","For video, revenue is down 0.7% in the quarter due to customer losses over the past 12 months, which has improved. From a revenue standpoint, we expect video to be the largest beneficiary of the product improvements, new offers and operating strategies over time, both from a penetration and ARPU perspective.","On the commercial side, we drove 21% growth in revenue reflecting strength in our small and medium business service offerings and also in the carrier space. Excluding video, commercial revenue increased nearly 26%. We continue to see significant opportunity in the commercial space with a long runway for growth, and we're making investments to capitalize on the opportunity in our footprint. In the second quarter, for ad sales rose nearly 15%, predominantly reflecting increased political spend.","So looking at Slide 7, we grew adjusted EBITDA 2.7% year-on-year. As a reminder, we had some net positive onetime adjustments in the second quarter of last year which put approximately $4 million of pressure on the year-over-year comparison this quarter.","The key expense drivers within the quarter were programming expenses which rose $25 million or 5.3% year-over-year, higher marketing expenses driven by increased media investment and commercial marketing, which ties into the higher residential and commercial customer growth.","Marketing costs were up $20 million in the quarter year-on-year, but excluding the onetime benefit recognized in the prior year quarter, increased by $13 million. And finally, a $22 million increase in other expenses. When you sort through the puts and takes, the key drivers for those expenses were labor, including sales force and benefits, increased preventive maintenance levels on the network, and reconnect expenses for higher reconnects mix percentages and volume.","Moving to CapEx on Slide 8. Q2 capital has totaled $468 million, $144 million higher than last year. The increase was driven by 3 key areas: $63 million higher spend on CPE to support increased installation, and as Tom mentioned, appropriate inventory levels to accommodate higher CPE placement expected in the second half of the year. Approximately 60% of the $63 million year-over-year increase related to inventory pull forward; second, increased scalable infrastructure spending. We saw some timing between the first 2 quarters and the year-to-date increase of some $40 million in this category was largely driven by higher capital investment for Internet penetration and throughput; and finally, higher commercial CapEx, which increased $16 million to $61 million in the second quarter to support growth in that business particularly cell backhaul construction.","At this time, we estimate our 2012 CapEx spend to be at least $1.5 billion, and we could exceed that by as much as $200 million depending on the level of success of our new operating strategy, which would reflect higher RGU growth and increased video CPE placement for new and existing customers as a result of increased digitization and DVR penetration. This type of spend has a clear ROI positive outcome driven by the objectives Tom outlined. And if we're successful, we would expect to see elevated CPE spend continue as we go all-digital and put the full set of Charter products in existing and new customer's homes. The clear expectation is that this investment strategy will put us on a very different growth path.","Turning to cash flow on Slide 9, we generated free cash flow of $26 million, down from last year's second quarter, mostly due to the higher capital investment. We ended June with a weighted average interest cost of 6.6%, and our run rate interest expense is roughly $850 million, including the 13.5% notes which are callable November 30. Our leverage was 4.8x adjusted EBITDA at June 30, and our target leverage range is 4 to 4.5x, plus or minus a half turn either way to enable strategic activity. And while we're investing for growth, we remain focused on getting into that target leverage range.","And now back to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Chris. In closing, I'd just like to say that we're excited about implementing the new operating strategies and are pleased with the early successes we've seen. The goal is to be well-positioned and grow not only in the Internet and commercial, but to win back video customers over time and grow our phone service. And we'll keep those relationships with product packaging, service and price value which nobody can match. Our strategy will have short-term implications for our run rate, for adjusted EBITDA and capital, but I believe our actions will make us more competitive , improve our service, put more value in the home, create higher incremental value per transaction and increase our long term growth potential in a positive way.","Operator, let's open the call for questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions, if I could. First, Tom, for you, you talked about winning back video subscribers, you look like you've added an awful lot of non-video subscribers in the last quarter end, and over the last year. Can you talk about what the strategies are to win back those video subscribers? I would presume that pool of people that take your broadband product but not your video would be your first target audience. And then, Chris, just on the higher inventories that you talked about in CapEx, is it fair to say that given that you've already preset some of the inventories you would need, that the higher CapEx for the rest of the year to get to the year guidance would largely be capitalized labor? Or at least the increment would be capitalized labor? And if so, does that have an impact on your expected labor expense that would hit EBITDA margins?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, Craig, with regard to win back, you're right. Our previous strategy and our results have created a lot of data-only relationships in Charter. We have almost 1 million of those relationships, and so the opportunity to sell them other products has always been a part of our strategy. And so that is a big opportunity. But even larger than that is the unsold passings universe and the satellite subscriber base that exist inside that universe. And what we've been doing to get ready to market to that universe is to make our product set superior to satellite. So we've gone away from the historic analog distribution that we've had, and gone to an all-digital product, the 2-way interactive video product with state-of-the-art HD quality on the bulk of the service, and we're moving toward getting a fully deployed HD product across our entire footprint on every channel we carry. And as you know, there's a lot of inertia in the video business, but we have an inherently superior video product than our competitors in most places, the bulk of our competitors. And we have a superior data product and a superior voice product, and put those all together in a package that's compelling, it actually creates a value proposition for the consumer based on what they're currently paying. And we think we have an opportunity to grow our business for years to come.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Craig, on the second question related to capital in general and labor, so we took during the second quarter, reflecting a higher percentage of our customers that were being sold into digital, reflecting a higher number of boxes that were being placed into those homes already starting in Q2, but gearing up for Q3 in particular. And the higher number of DVR sell-in and a higher placement of DVRs inside the home, that type of inventory increase will continue. And as the model plays out, we'll accelerate. And so I think you'll see some of those trends continue. On that basis, when we increase the estimate for CapEx for this year, over 90% of that increase really comes from CPE. And so that should give you some indication, it's also the reason that the range is somewhat wide depending on the level of success and how quickly that grabs hold as planned. Your second question was on labor. And so, yes, to the extent you're doing more installs, and to the extent you're spending more time in the home placing more CPE, all of which is accretive, you'll be spending more on labor. Some of that will be OpEx to the extent it's a reconnected home, and some of that will be capital to the extent, let's say, new home or with a new service. So all of that will be flowing through in the coming quarters.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But would you expect this capitalized labor to be a net benefit to expense in that less of it hits the income statement because more of it hits the balance sheet? Or would you expect it to be an addition to both pools because of the increased volumes?","Christopher L. Winfrey","I'd expect it to be an addition to both pools because of increased volumes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","This is Jeff Wlodarczak. One for Tom and 2 quick ones for Chris. Tom, is part of your ultimate strategy here over time to re-brand the Charter offering or are you satisfied with the Charter brand in the market? And then for Chris, is the temporary effects of the customers connects in revenue for new initiatives, is that mostly related to the fact that you're no longer marketing analog or is there something else? And then Chris, for the last couple of quarters, you had been running about a $9 million hit related to investments in your customer experience. Did you still have that hit that quarter -- excuse me, this quarter and what's the outlook going forward?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, Jeff, on the re-branding strategy, we don't have a re-branding strategy at the moment. And there are parts -- there are aspects of the way Charter's footprint is distributed that makes re-branding more difficult for us than some companies. So I'm not sure it's a good idea. We think that we can be successful with our current brand, and it doesn't mean that we won't consider it, but we don't have a current plan to change our brand name.","Christopher L. Winfrey","And, Jeff, on the temporary effects of connects to the revenue, it's a combination of what you were describing, which is actively only marketing our digital product, as well as transitioning different sales channels to different selling methods and the process that is going on there, as well as when you're bringing on these customers maybe having a little bit less onetime revenue in the short term, which generates a higher recurring revenue stream over the long term. As to the customer experience investments, it does continue. And I would say, over $5 million was what we saw inside the quarter. It's becoming less of a onetime item as we spend more time in the home to make sure that the customer's issues are fully resolved before we'd leave a trouble call and preventative maintenance, which we've talked about for a couple quarters now as we accelerate that, will become a recurring practice over time. And so that's probably why you've heard us move less to speaking about that as we expect to be doing those activities going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stefan Anninger with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2, if I could. I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the product set that you're hoping to launch on the video side, so more HD is clearly part of the roadmap. But I was hoping you could expand on the other parts of the feature set that you hope to offer like gateway boxes, live video feeds in the home on devices beyond the TV set, et cetera. And then my second question is about your new pricing and package initiatives that you started earlier in the summer. Perhaps you could big give us a bit of color on the customer response to that, I think it featured more focus on obviously Doubles and Triple Plays, but also premium services, et cetera.","Thomas M. Rutledge","All right, well, with regard to our video product, we've gone from a business where we were selling analog television up against an all-digital satellite broadcast service. And we've morphed that into a product set that now is all-digital and 2-way interactive and has at least 100 channels of HD and will ultimately have, in a relatively short period of time, every channel that we carry that's capable of being carried in HD, in HD. And that product is -- unlike satellite is a 2-way interactive product that has the capability of VOD transactions, both transactional VOD and free VOD. So it's inherently a better product as currently configured than our satellite competitors. But we had to put the plant and put the operation in place to make that capable. With regard to the long run and CPE, we do have an evolving CPE strategy. We have not committed to a gateway, I think that intelligence in the network, meaning capabilities in the network make a gateway not necessarily an efficient way of going forward for us. We would like to end up with the lowest CPE possible, and we think that we can get on a curve where we have declining CPE per unit cost for years to come. And we're actively trying to pursue that. At the same time, we think that there are opportunities to use cloud-based services, including streaming video and streaming guide applications, that allow our customers to interact with existing CPE and to use new features or new equipment like iPads and Android devices to watch TV, and we will be rolling those out toward the end of this year, the beginning of next year, and have an integrated network-based video, CPE strategy going forward. With regard to packaging and Triple Play, as I said in my comments, now since we've done the packaging, our Triple Play sell-in has more than doubled, and it's only been in the market for a month, and we expect to continue growth in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question for Mr. Rutledge. You've had the benefit of working at a number of cable firms in the industry. As you implement these structural changes and this new strategy to go all-digital and sell the Triple Play more aggressively, are there 1 or 2 metrics that you think are most important that you would suggest we use to sort of benchmark your progress versus peers? Is it something like EBITDA per home passed, is that the right way or EBITDA less CapEx per home pass? What would you think is the most salient metric for us to follow?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I do think EBITDA per home passed is the ultimate metric. And if you look at Charter, we have the lowest EBITDA per home passed, and which to me is why Charter is so valuable. It's got all of that upside opportunity and what we call runway. So as we go forward, I think you'll want to see us growing our revenue line. And growing that revenue line in a good way, meaning creating customer relationships that are higher revenue per month customer relationships.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is David Joyce for Vijay. I was wondering how the TiVo box fits into your CapEx plan? Are you still committed to TiVo there? And given the product strategy, what's the prospect of the EBITDA growth in the second half?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, our commitment to TiVo is a commitment to their software actually. And we have a license agreement with TiVo to use their user interface, and we are using their user interface currently on boxes they provide. But as we go forward, our strategy is to use the user interface, both in the cloud and on existing CPE and on a new CPE.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And on the EBITDA growth potential, given your product strategy for the second half?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Chris, why don't you...","Christopher L. Winfrey","So we don\u2019t provide EBITDA guidance. So I won't do that here. But I think what I would express is that the past few quarters have demonstrated, when we've accelerated growth what are the impacts of that both in terms of increasing OpEx from a onetime or an accelerated growth rate level of OpEx, as well as for CapEx, and everything that we're talking about here is certainly about accelerating the growth, not only in terms of the amount of relationships that we have, but the depth of our product and services that we're providing into the home for new and existing customers. And so you'll see pressure, both from a CapEx as well as from an OpEx perspective to drive that growth. Ultimately, all of which is going to drive a higher customer relationship ARPU, as well as intended to drive a higher long term run rate EBITDA and the EBITDA per home passed that Tom was referencing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can I just ask for some clarification? There was one sentence in your release that said you expected customer connects revenue and OpEx may be adversely affected during the transition. The revenue and OpEx seems pretty clear, but the customer connects I was a little confused about.","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'm not sure I understand the question.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, I think I did. This is what I referenced before. We're -- as we transition to new selling methods and the way we go to market, everything from the marketing strategy, targeting strategy, selling strategy, the organizational structure that Tom was referencing is just turning a lot of knobs all at the same time. And so while we have a very compelling pricing and packaging structure that's going in place, and it's seen very early success, you're changing a lot -- you're turning a lot of knobs at the same time and so you could expect to see, you might see some short-term impacts from doing that.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So we should look for the business turning up more in the fourth quarter than the third, does that make sense?","Christopher L. Winfrey","I don't think we're at a stage where we're providing monthly or quarterly guidance, but it's a natural impact of that, of what I was describing, and that'll take some time to work out, and as well as moving away from selling -- proactively selling analog and focusing more on selling digital which, at the end of the day, is a much higher-quality customer base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Can you talk about -- on 2013 CapEx. I know it's still a little early, but how much I guess is onetime in nature and since most of your CapEx is success-based, can you just help us think through the moving pieces for 2013? And also, can you comment on any churn benefits from DTV not carrying Viacom or DISH and AMC in your footprint?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we -- the second part of your question, I'll answer first. It's hard for us to see that because the same time those events were going on, we changed basically everything we do in terms of how we go to market. And that we did say that we've been successful so far with our new selling techniques. I can't attribute those to any other external factors and what proportion they might play. With regard to -- we're not giving guidance for future periods for CapEx, but the biggest issue that we will have from a CapEx perspective going forward is how fast we grow. And the faster you grow, the higher the CPE would be in the periods when you're growing rapidly.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Okay. I guess, is there any way to parse out how much CapEx would -- is onetime in nature for this year?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Well, Amy, if you take a look inside the slides that we've prepared, you can see a split out, there's also in the trending schedule. So you see a pretty clear split out of the CPE component of that inside of each quarter. So you can pretty clearly take a look at when we've grown faster, where that has driven CPE. We've also mentioned that to the extent we're having success at these kind of levels, as well as increasingly going all-digital over the course of the next 2 years. You'll expect to see that column inside of the bar chart continue to be at elevated levels, and I don't think if we're successful in 2013, I wouldn't expect that portion to be going down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up to an earlier question, Chris, on the pricing and packaging changes. Is there any impact on the install base on the changes that you're having that are factoring into your forward comments?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Well, I think, at this stage, we're focused on getting new customers to connect. But obviously, your existing base of customers are getting excited about the offers that are in market, the opportunity to have up to 4 DVRs for $20, and they're calling in. We're moving them into higher priced and higher -- more importantly, higher valued packages. And over time, they'll be targeted. So you may have customers who are calling in and sitting at ARPU of x and call in for an upgrade and get moved to an ARPU of y for which you have some upfront capital and expense to go upgrade that customer and put CPE deeper into the home. At this stage, the larger focus is on new relationships, but some of that certainly for sure will exist for existing relationships as they move into the higher value packages.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just, Tom, on the capital network outlook or strategy, what does all-digital mean in this context? And Charter has used, utilized switch digital in the past to add capacity? And then we've seen sort of various versions of all-digital from some of the other operators you've had the -- is it the sort of DTA approach? At Comcast, I think, there's been some reclaims down to the B1 or that's sort of Comcast-speak of the lifeline basic or are you talking about a completely digital, eliminating all analog down the road? And if you are, can you just maybe give us a sense for what the boxes per digital sub level looks like, so we can sort of figure out what that might mean in terms of sort of CPE levels.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. What we mean is all and completely turn off all the analog product. With regard to the network, it means that the network itself actually is unburdened by the going through an all-digital platform, and it actually -- one way of thinking about it, it creates additional capacity without any additional capital because you're essentially turning off fat analog spectrum, making that spectrum available for other users, the biggest one among those might be additional data speed capabilities. So going all-digital, while it's a painful process and requires a placement of CPE, it actually frees up the capacity of your network. One way of thinking about it, it gives you -- it extends the life of your network and the capability of your network without any additional network capital having to be spent. With regard to a CPE per household, I think it's around 3 units per house on average, and that varies, but that's a good number. And we think that we can ride a reduced cost curve of CPE. We think there some factors that are working in our favor in terms of the kinds of CPE that are available. And smart televisions and iPads, for instance, are televisions that have a set-top box essentially integrated into them as part of the -- or another way of thinking about an iPad is it's a cable-ready TV in an IP world. And so we think that ultimately, CPE per unit will go down and that the number, the amount of CPE device in the house that's watching cable television will go down. The amount of CPE necessary because some of the devices will actually, essentially be integrated CPE devices.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just to be clear, you're saying that the average Charter sub has about 3 TVs per home, is that what the 3 was referring to?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But today, if you think about the current business, how many boxes are in the those digital households today, that you'll have to then increase to get to 3, to make sure that all their TVs work when you move the analog of?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Chris, do you want to answer that?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, I'm not sure that it's any longer on our trending schedule, but a few quarters ago, it was, and it was 1.5 per digital customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just had 2 questions. One, wondering why there wasn't more flow-through from the broadband price increases that you implemented in April? I think there were $2 to $3 on most of the tiers, but looks like ARPU increased only about $0.20 sequentially. And then the other question I had is, I understand you went back using fully featured DVRs for your whole home DVR solution, is there a product roadmap to move back towards centralized in-home storage and thinner clients? Or are you going to skip that step and go straight to a network DVR?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'll answer the last question first. We don't know yet what the right answer to that question is. But we think that the immediate opportunity is to use conventional DVRs and that the long run opportunity is to buy DVRs in more efficient packages, meaning by storage in bulk and whether that's in the home or whether that's in the network, I'm not sure yet what the right answer to that is, it's an evolving question as technology change -- I mean, an evolving answer as technology changes.","Christopher L. Winfrey","And on the Internet ARPU, the increase we saw was exactly what we expected. And I think what we had mentioned is that on average across the customer base, the rate increase was about 1.2% on average across the entire base. There are segments of both Internet and video to which those rate increases were applied that were not eligible for a rate increase because they may have been inside of a price guarantee contract, and so it couldn't be applied to that. But from our perspective, the Internet ARPU uplift was exactly what we expected and as well as the overall rate increase at 1.2% across the base is what we were looking for and what was achieved.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions, the first is on the balance sheet. We've recently seen a lot of issuance in the high-yield market. Your benchmark bonds are trading well inside of 5% now and if I'm not mistaken, you still have a big chunk of that 13.5% notes outstanding. Any reason in particular we haven't seen Charter come to market with another refi?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Look, we're always looking at the market and the opportunities that presents itself both in the bank as well as the bond market. And the reality is that we've done 2 tenders on this 13.5% notes, and we're thinking through all of that in an NPV positive way. And we've tendered twice to take out those 13.5% notes, and we didn't get all of them in. They become callable on November 30, so that you can imagine all the different type of analyses we do internally to think that through, and obviously, both bond and bank markets have been somewhat attractive as of late and continue to take a look on it on an NPV basis.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then all of the commentary surrounding the growth opportunity, you've also mentioned a desire to bring leverage down at least a little bit, I believe, so I suppose I'm seeing the obvious, but should I infer a common stock dividend isn't even in the conversation at this stage?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Well, I think the better way to think about it is that we do have a target leverage of 4 to 4.5x, and we're comfortable plus or minus half turn to enable strategic opportunities. Those opportunities have always included, whether it was stock buybacks, whether it was M&A, whether it was investing deeper inside the business, as well as if you didn't have a better use for it, and you were kind of inside your target leverage range potentially on a dividend. I think what we're expressing today as we see the biggest opportunity for an ROI and payback by investing inside the business, and that's why we've accelerated the CapEx to implement the plan that Tom was outlining. So we see that as the best use of cash flow today. That could change over time as opportunities present themselves. But we're at 4.8x today, so we're not sitting on excess cash or below our target leverage range, and we'll be focused on getting into that target leverage range and evaluating uses of free cash flow once we're there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","I have a few questions as well. So I guess the first one for Tom, on the win back of the penetration of non-video subs with a data product. I know the DISH partnership you had eluded to last call that you were going to follow up on that, and I was wondering if you still see that as a potentially important channel that you could be aggressively pursuing, and how much of that was a factor in Q2. And separately, I wanted to see when we can begin to hear about your wireless roadmap, especially now that you're very close to your all-digital completion? Is that a 2013 event? I know Tom you'd recently suggested that Wi-Fi could be a superior solution for cable compared to cellular or even 4G. So if you can maybe help us to articulate your plans on that and how that could factor into your CapEx plans? And lastly, for either Tom or Chris, I guess on the CapEx, when I think about your system right, so correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like close to 10% of your footprint now is kind of either not -- less than 550 or even not 2-way activated. So while that's a relatively small percentage, it's certainly not insignificant compared to your peers and certainly so for Cablevision if you think about the competitive situation out there. So again, the question is can you maybe provide some color on what you're seeing in those particular markets and if you might see an urgency to address this in the future CapEx plans. I know now you've articulated CPE success-based for those systems, I'm wondering if you see some vulnerability that might lend some urgency to upgrade those systems.","Thomas M. Rutledge","All right, well, with regard to the DISH relationship, it hasn't had any impact of any material impact in our strategy in the second quarter. And I haven't addressed it, but it's a very small channel and not significant, I guess, is the best way to describe it. With regard to wireless, we don't have a plan currently to deploy wireless hotspots on our plant, but it is an opportunity for the business, and we do have an opportunity immediately to start deploying Wi-Fi in commercial circumstances where the commercial customer also has Wi-Fi available to our customers as a result of their relationship with us. And it's a hotspot strategy that's based on physical location as opposed to -- and the customer relationship as opposed to the plant itself. That said, in the long run, the cable architecture is a very robust architecture and the data network that we have is very robust and can carry -- as I said before, when we take off analog signals and unburden our cable plant, the amount of capacity that we have available to add to our data product is huge, particularly huge relative to what we've already deployed against the data product, and it's already a better data product than our competitors. You can leverage that data product by attaching radios to it and have very small cells with very high capacity, and they can be Wi-Fi, they can be cellular or some combination of both. And so I think in the long run, our architecture lends itself to either an adjunct service to the 4G products that are currently being deployed by the cellular companies or a direct competitor.","Christopher L. Winfrey","The final question you had there was just related to the bi-directionality and the over 550 megahertz of the network. And if you take a look on the trending schedule, you'll see that the homes passed per Internet is about 97% of our total homes passed, which means that at a minimum 97% is 2-way or about 98% that's above 550 megahertz. So you're really talking about at the edge case studies and that has not been the focus as of today.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay. So you don't see a need to get substantially closer to 750, that's not an issue right now?","Christopher L. Winfrey","No. We're now saying 98% is greater than 550 megahertz, predominantly that is at 750.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, we have no plans today to upgrade any networks beyond what their current capacity is. And we think that even the 550, the small number of 550 plants we have in an all digital world are sufficient.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Tullo with Albert Fried.","Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division","A question in regards to set-top boxes, is the increase in CapEx in the back half of the year related to the TiVo implementation? Or are there other implementations outside of that?","Thomas M. Rutledge","It's the -- it's the increase in regular set-top boxes that we're deploying across our footprint and it has nothing to do with TiVo directly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Russo - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Brian Russo for Doug. Is marketing easier or more challenging now that you have 1\/3 of the video subs in the market versus the 2\/3 at Cablevision? And what are you doing differently at the Charter versus Cablevision in terms of marketing?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, it is a different marketing situation and our concentration in DMAs is different than other companies that I've been associated with in the past. And our penetration is lower, so there are challenges to that and opportunities. The opportunity is we have more to sell, and we have a lot of diverse marketplaces with a competitive footprint that I think gives us an opportunity to have a superior product to our competitors. So there's a whole series of puts and takes, but it is a different marketing environment, and in some ways, the good side of it is that that we have a superior product to our competitors in a lot of places. The difficulty of it is that using mass media is harder to do than other situations, but the growth of the Internet interestingly creates a new medium to target customers that hasn't existed, so that the cluster strategy of the '80s and '90s of putting your cable systems together in TV markets, may not necessarily be as effective today with the opportunity to sell your product through a data service. So we're learning what the best and most effective marketing techniques are, and we're encouraged by the results that we're getting.","Robin Gutzler","Great, thank you. Operator, I think that's all we have.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And thank you for participating in today's conference.

Additionally, all customers and passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO, and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Stefan.","In the past quarter, we remained focused on the integration of three large companies and increasing the high-quality sales with Spectrum pricing and packaging in the acquired footprints. We're creating one company with a unified and centralized operating approach, which puts Charter on a path to be able to grow faster over a multiyear period. The integration is going well and remains on schedule.","Our third quarter operating results were as planned, despite all the complexity that comes with completely changing the way we do business in 75% of our footprint. We're growing our customer relationships by 4%, and our customer and financial growth will continue to improve as more and more of our customer base migrates to Spectrum pricing and packaging and all-digital is completed and an even better video and Internet product rolls out and our unified service platform, which is a product in itself, is deployed.","In 2017, we're seeing all the short-term effects of implementing a sustainable growth strategy, including high churn from legacy products and temporary ARPU pressure from migration, partly offset by higher sales and better product.","And our EBITDA growth is better than when we took legacy Charter through a similar process. Inside the businesses, we're executing well and have put the highest risks associated with our integration behind us. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma tested the integration of our people, processes, and systems. All performed well, and we've recovered nicely and are essentially back to business as usual. The hurricanes did impact our customer net adds and financial results this quarter, but only marginally. Chris will cover these effects in a moment.","In the third quarter, our customer and individual product connects inside our new footprint were higher year over year, as they were in the second quarter. The higher connect activity shows that our Spectrum pricing and packaging is working. At the end of the third quarter, 41% of Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers were in our new pricing and packaging, up from 30% at the end of last quarter. In areas where we've had Spectrum in place for at least four quarters, 52% of our residential customers have Spectrum package products.","We're selling and migrating better products with better and consistent pricing that drives higher customer satisfaction. Nearly all of our video connects and Spectrum migrations subscribed to expanded basic video product, which some people call fat basic, with VOD on every outlet. As of today, we offer Internet speeds of 100 megabits in over 75% of our entire footprint, up from just 50% at the end of the second quarter. And we expect to offer minimum speeds in excess of 100 megabits in nearly all of our passings by year-end.","We'll continue to increase our minimum speeds in 2018. In a couple of months, we'll also launch gigabit speeds offerings in several key markets using DOCSIS 3.1, with more launches planned through 2018. We expect DOCSIS 3.1 modems to be priced similarly to DOCSIS 3.0 modems when purchased at scale, and we'll begin to buy exclusively DOCSIS 3.1 modems and drive higher entry-level speeds.","We'll also begin to deploy our Wave 2 Wi-Fi router, which is similar to our Worldbox, having been developed and designed and specified by Charter. It has much faster speeds and even better propagation of reliability throughout the home. Our all-digital activity in legacy Time Warner Cable and Bright House is accelerating. However, the bulk of that activity will still take place in 2018.","At the end of the third quarter, we have deployed over 1 million Worldboxes across our national footprint. Worldbox is faster, smaller, cheaper, and more flexible for QAM and IP video and guide delivery, and it can be used across all three legacy footprints. Going forward, Worldbox will be the only set-top box we buy and will be the workhorse for our all-digital project.","The deployment of our Spectrum Guide also continues to progress. We've seen a significant increase in on-demand utilization by customers that have Spectrum Guide today, exposing the value of the content packages they already purchase. In 2018, we'll provide Spectrum Guide to new customers in legacy Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets. Existing customers in those markets will, over time, have the choice to switch to Spectrum Guide at the push of a button. We'll deploy the same approach in certain legacy Charter markets that are contiguous with legacy Time Warner Cable or Bright House markets, what we call mixed markets, where we waited to roll out to the full DMA.","In the fourth quarter of last year, our Enterprise group launched new national pricing structures designed to drive higher customer growth. That pricing structure is working well, and we saw higher year-over-year enterprise product net adds in the third quarter. The short-term revenue effects of that market share growth strategy are similar to what we've been seeing where we're making changes to pricing and packaging in residential and SMB markets.","We're also improving the product set for Enterprise, deploying our hosted voice product to 13 more states in the third quarter, with plans to launch that product across our entire footprint by the end of this year. And in the coming months, we expect to launch a software-defined wide-area network solution that should increase our addressable opportunity and provide businesses with another choice as they migrate from legacy technologies.","We're on track to launch our wireless service in 2018 using our MVNO agreement with Verizon. Our core operation agreement with Comcast has helped with that process. When offered as part of our bundle, we expect Spectrum branded wireless services to drive more sales of our core products and to create longer customer lives.","Our next-generation wireless field testing is also going well. Our existing infrastructure puts us in a position to uniquely scale deployment of new wireless small-cell products. And we expect a number of emerging technologies, including better Wi-Fi, 5G, public spectrum brands, and radio management protocols will all support our ability to innovate new network-based product offerings for the foreseeable future, using a technology transformation similar to what the cable industry has done in its infrastructure so many times.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chris to provide more details on the quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Tom.","Before covering our results, a couple of administrative items; first, I wanted to remind everyone that when I reference third quarter 2017 customer results, I'll be comparing to third quarter 2016 results that have been adjusted to exclude the seasonal program customer activity in the third quarter of 2016 at legacy Bright House. We've provided that year-over-year comparison on slide 6 of today's investor presentation. The Q3 impact is really modest. Q2 was relevant, but we expect Q4 and the first quarter to also be relevant.","Secondly, as Tom mentioned, our third quarter results were impacted by hurricanes Irma and Harvey, although not materially. In total, we estimate the impact was about 10,000 to 15,000 net residential customer relationships in storm-affected areas, some of which may come back in the fourth quarter.","The storms also reduced our third quarter revenue by $4 million in the form of residential customer bill credits. We also provided some modest SMB customer credits. And there was some impact to September advertising revenue, but difficult to say precisely how many orders would have been placed.","Our third quarter operating expenses were elevated by $8 million, mostly related to storm cleanup and call center labor costs. In the third quarter, storm-related capital expenditures were about $20 million, mostly related to line and equipment replacements. We expect a similar amount of storm-related CapEx in the fourth quarter, and we'll provide updates on those amounts and any material credits, if any, when we report our fourth quarter results. Some of these costs will ultimately be covered by insurance, but there are no potential claims impacting today's results.","Now turning to our results, during the third quarter, total customer relationships grew by 212,000 or 1 million over the last year, with 3.4% growth at TWC, 4.5% at legacy Charter, and 5.4% at Bright House. As Tom mentioned, 41% of TWC and Bright House customers were already at Spectrum pricing and packaging at the end of the third quarter. We're driving higher sales year over year into better products with more value, even as we migrate or churn legacy products, driving significant transaction volume.","Slide 6 shows we grew residential PSUs by 172,000 versus 322,000 last year. Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by 3.4%. Pre-deal Charter has been about flat, and legacy Bright House improved its residential video customer loss to 0.6% year over year.","TWC lost 25,000 more video customers than last year, as we continue to see churn from the same low-value, limited basic packages, net of migration to a full video product. Importantly, limited basic losses were responsible for all of the video losses at TWC this quarter, with legacy TWC's expanded basic video customer base growing by just over 50,000 in the third quarter versus a loss of approximately 130,000 expanded customers in last year's third quarter. So that means there's a 180,000 swing in the expanded video relationship development in the quarter at TWC. The better expanded basic performance was driven by higher connects and a better sell-in mix and from legacy TWC limited basic customers migrating to our Spectrum pricing and packaging.","Legacy Charter lost 11,000 video customers in the quarter versus a gain of 19,000 a year ago, driven by our integration focus on the acquired footprints and some additional competitive build-out and price-driven promotional offers advertised by competitors.","Bright House lost 7,000 video customers versus a loss of 9,000 last year. In total, we lost 104,000 residential video customers, primarily TWC limited basic video relationships.","In residential Internet, we added a total of 249,000 customers during the quarter versus 344,000 last year, with legacy Charter declining from 121,000 in the third quarter last year to 70,000 this quarter, partly from the same drivers we saw on video at legacy Charter and believe to be temporary in nature. We also had a strong Internet quarter last year, and each of our legacy footprints benefited from integration activity at key competitors. Over the last 12 months, we grew our total residential Internet customer base by 1.2 million customers or 5.7%, with 5.3% growth at TWC, 6.4% growth at legacy Charter, and 7% at Bright House.","In Voice, we grew customers by 27,000 in the third quarter versus 29,000 last year, with higher triple-play sales offset by higher churn of legacy promotional offers at TWC.","Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 865,000 or 3.5%. Residential revenue per customer relationship was up modestly, helped by some $50 million of revenue from the August Mayweather-McGregor fight.","Similar to last quarter, ARPU growth remains muted by smaller price increases this year, continued standalone Internet sell-in and higher sell-in at promotional rates, and migration activity of legacy TWC and Bright House to Spectrum pricing and packaging. It results in a mechanical ARPU hit similar to Q2 from changes to the legacy Bright House seasonal plan.","Before the close of our transactions, one of the biggest concerns of our investors was our ability to manage ARPU through the transition to higher-value Spectrum pricing and packaging, with generally lower pricing for more product, lower box fees, and lower modem fees. Now, nearly one year in, it should be 50% migrated by year-end. So that's a lot of product and rate transactions in a large portion of our base now with more value and less reason to call or churn. We've rationalized the commercial roll-off and the retention environment. And the ARPU and revenue still look pretty good despite that planned disruption.","Slide 7 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 4.4%, or 3.7% when excluding total pay-per-view in both periods. Total commercial revenue in SMB and enterprise combined grew by 8%, SMB revenue by 7.4%, and Enterprise up by 8.9%. Excluding cell backhaul and NaviSite, Enterprise grew by over 13%. Sales are up in both SMB and Enterprise, and we're managing the transition to highly competitive pricing in these service markets as well.","Third quarter advertising revenue declined by 11% year over year, driven by political advertising in the prior year. So excluding political, advertising revenue was still down about 2% year over year, given lower year-over-year barter and local revenue. That includes some for hurricane-related effects as I mentioned at the outset.","In total, third quarter revenue for the company was up 4.2% year over year and 4.9% when excluding advertising","Looking into the revenue growth for each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 3.8%. Pre-deal Charter grew by 5.2%, driven by customer growth. And Bright House revenue grew by 4.3%, given improving video and triple-play sell-in.","Moving to operating expense on slide 8, in the third quarter, total operating expense grew by $238 million or 3.7% year over year. the transition expense accounted for $23 million of our total OpEx this quarter.","Programming increased 12.3% year over year, driven by contractual rate increases and renewals, a higher expanded mix, which accounted for roughly 2% of that growth, the cost of the Mayweather-McGregor pay-per-view fight, which accounted for a little over 1% of the growth, and the lapping of synergies generated in the third quarter last year.","Regulatory, connectivity, and produced content was up 1.6% year over year. and cost to service customers declined year over year, driven by the benefits from the combinations of the three companies, productivity benefits, including from simplified pricing and packaging, and a higher in-sourced labor mix, partly offset by higher labor costs driven by the recent storms.","Marketing expenses grew by 5.6% year over year, given a higher level of marketing activity and a higher number of sales in the acquired footprints. And other expenses were down 2% year over year, driven by elimination of duplicate costs.","Adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.0% in the third quarter. And excluding transition costs in both periods, adjusted EBITDA grew by 4.7%.","Turning to net income on slide 9, we generated $48 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus net income of $189 million last year, with higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and lower severance-related expenses more than offset by higher depreciation and amortization, pension withdrawal and remeasurement charges, and higher interest expense.","Turning to slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in the third quarter, including $125 million of transition spend. Excluding transition, third quarter CapEx increased by $629 million year over year, primarily driven by higher spending on CPE, scalable infrastructure, and support. The higher CPE spend was marginally the result of higher connect volumes and two-way set-top box placement rates now that Spectrum pricing and packaging has been launched across all of our markets. And we've already reduced our DTA footprint by over 30% since closing the transactions.","All-digital spend was about $50 million in the quarter, primarily related to CPE. The higher scalable spend was driven by the timing of in-year spend in video and Internet product development. And the higher support spending is related to the timing of vehicles and tools and test equipment, software development and facility spending, in each case, some related to in-sourcing and some related to the transaction.","As slide 11 shows, we generated about $600 million of free cash flow in the third quarter versus $1 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter last year. And the decline was largely driven by higher CapEx and a smaller working capital benefit \u2013 a benefit in both years, at least year over year. And that was partly offset by higher EBITDA.","We finished the quarter with $66.8 billion in debt principal. And our run rate annualized cash interest expense September 30 was $3.6 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense in the quarter suggests a $3.2 billion annual run rate. That difference is due to purchase accounting.","As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.3 times, in the middle of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times.","In July, we closed on $1.5 billion of investment-grade notes. In August, we closed of $1.5 billion of high-yield notes. And in September, we closed on another $2 billion of investment-grade notes. And finally, earlier this month we closed on another $1.5 billion of high-yield notes. The proceeds from these offerings have and will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks. Our weighted average cost of debt is now 5.4% with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, with over 90% of our debt maturing after 2019.","So in the third quarter, we repurchased 10.9 million shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling $4.0 billion at an average price of $367 per share. As slide 11 shows, in the past 13 months we spent $10.1 billion on repurchases, reflecting 10% of the company's equity on a fully diluted basis.","I want to be very clear. Our share repurchases are not part of a programmatic capital return policy. Buybacks reflect: confidence in the trajectory of the proven operating model as we head into the back half of our integration; positive cash flow despite significant organic investment; and attractive debt markets and a high-quality capital structure, which provides us flexibility in different markets. Going forward, our share repurchase activity will continue to depend on other potential uses of capital for organic or inorganic opportunities and market conditions.","Turning to our tax assets on slide 13, we estimate the total present value of those assets, reflecting our current NOA utilization, is over $5 billion. And we don't expect to be a material cash income tax payer until 2019 at the earliest.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, thank you. I'm not sure whether this is for Chris or for Tom, but I wonder if either of you could just speak about what really looks to be an industrywide transition, at least on the margin, to more single-play broadband subscribers. Your pricing for standalone broadband doesn't recapture as much margin from a lost video subscriber as the pricing does at, say, Comcast. I'm wondering. As you think about that going forward, how do you think about that? When is the right time to maybe adjust that pricing, or is it more that you really do think that you can keep customers in double-play and triple-play bundles for longer than most in the market expect?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Craig, it's Tom. We still have a very rapidly growing, good business. And if you look at all these numbers, we're growing the company quickly. And, yes, the Video business has pressure in it and it has had pressure in it. We still think we can grow the Video business going forward and expect to grow the Video business going forward. And we expect to sell packaged products going forward, including data, mobility, landline voice, and video.","And it's true that there are lots of pressures on the video bundle, the biggest pressure being price. The second biggest pressure, which also contributes to the price\/value relationship, is that many programmers now are distributors, whether they know it or not, whether it's through TV Everywhere or direct-to-consumer streaming services. And because of password sharing and multiple-stream products to households that have \u2013 there are 35 million one-person households in the United States. So you have 10% of the population with almost 30% of the households. And multi-stream products being sold to those households allow consumers to purchase one product and share it among multiple users. That affects the price\/value relationship of video in general, and that affects what people are subscribing to.","And so there's an enormous pressure that comes out of the total price of content plus the availability of it for free that content is now being \u2013 I should restate that. There's an enormous ability for people to receive free content because of the way content distributors are securing their product so ineffectively. And as a result of that, I think you'll see continued pressure on video. But we expect that we can still grow a rich video package inside our product bundles, and we think we'll do that at the expense of our competitors, and we think that the general category will continue to decline slightly.","But to your broader question about pricing, we're happy with the way we're pricing our packaging today. We're happy with the way we're pricing our single-product services today, and we think we have an excellent growth trajectory based on our pricing structure.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thanks, Tom.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. In the prior call, Comcast mentioned several times they were prepared for the change in the competitive environment. And I guess I would ask you, along those same lines, when you went into the Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions, how much did you think about a potential change? I guess the stocks are telling us that the market thinks this is happening faster than they had expected. Do you think this is a case as the competitive environment changed faster, and how prepared are you?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I guess we expect change. There's always change, but we don't think it's faster than we thought. We think that we're actually exactly on plan, where we planned to be in our acquisition model, and we're happy with where we are. We've actually made a very complex integration of very large companies, and we're growing those companies. And we're actually in better shape transactionally than we were in legacy Charter doing a similar kind of approach.","And, yes, the markets move. Our data speeds continue to improve. Our video product can continue to improve on a relative basis, and our voice products and mobility products are new additions that didn't exist in prior iterations of this operating model. So, yes, markets move around. Competitive pressures change. We still think we have a very superior infrastructure relative to our competitors. We can use that infrastructure to be a high-quality competitor. Then we can move our mix of services and pricing and packaging around in an appropriate way to be responsive to the market and still grow rapidly.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Marci, I went back and looked through the past couple quarters what we've said on earnings calls as well as on the transcripts. In fact, the description that we gave of the model and the performance of the units and the performance of revenue as we get in the back half of this year and into 2018 and what we look like in 2019, and I wouldn't have changed any of it. I think it's all still the case, and I don't think the markets change that dramatically in such a short period of time.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","The other thing that I would add. I mentioned in Craig's question, there's a lot of unsecured video out there, which is impacting the value relationship of video in a dramatic fashion. And you would think that people would be responsive to that that sell video, and so markets correct as well.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Marci. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore-ISI","So, Tom, based on your comments just now about price being the factor on video, and these virtual MVPDs doing what they're doing, one, I think Charter is one company that has not used skinny video as a proposition in the market. And I think if anything, you've gone the other way as you've been moving the Time Warner Cable cohort to the Spectrum pricing. So the question really is, so is that a level you believe you need to pull to grow video longer term?","And second, just a housekeeping question; with respect to the total revenue growth we saw in the quarter, which seemed to have accelerated, but can you help us understand how much was the Mayweather fight on those numbers? Thank you.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So your fundamental question about our pull-through of video is we are selling a rich package of video. We believe most consumers want as much video as they can get. Not everybody is paying for it, but people like lots of video. And we sell a high-quality video service on the increment to all new customers.","So when you look at our programming expenses, a substantial piece of that is unit growth. We are actually growing customer relationships with high-quality, rich-featured, fully serviced and fully featured video products. We believe that those packages properly sold and properly contained within another value proposition, the whole customer relationship proposition that we make from a pricing impacting perspective, creates a more valuable, long-term, happier customer that creates value for us because of the length of that subscriber relationship. So that's our strategy.","On the edges, we're selling packages that have more targeted, less full-service component features. But the bulk of consumers that are purchasing video from us are actually buying richer packages than they've historically received from the legacy companies that service them.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Vijay, on the revenue, the biggest drivers in revenue are the really significant rate migration activity that we have going on at TWC and Bright House, and I gave the statistic. Over 40% of our customer base at TWC and Bright House has been migrated. If you take that over roughly 20 million customer relationships, that means 8 million rate, phone call, and in many cases equipment transactions taking place in the business (32:34). So that's the biggest driver in terms of the negative impact, and it's temporary in nature. The further we get on to the progress with that, the less impact it has.","But the Mayweather fight also had a positive impact, so it's going the other direction. $50 million in the quarter is what I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And then the other impact that I also mentioned in the prepared remarks was the amount of political advertising that was in last year's third quarter, but the biggest driver being the first one that I mentioned.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore-ISI","Great, thanks so much.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Yes.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey guys, thanks. If I can, a follow-up and then a question. First, I think there's a disconnect between what you expect and how investors read your comments. Last quarter you talked about having turned the corner on subscriber momentum, but this quarter showed weaker numbers year over year in every segment. How should we think about this as a competitive issue versus the natural evolution in the base? And how can we better understand your plans going forward?","And then, Chris, if you could, expand on your thinking behind the buyback pace. I understand returning the cash flow, but talk about the confidence in the business and why you lever up the company to buy back stock in a quarter where shares are elevated on M&A speculation and your numbers were trending weaker year over year. Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Great. So if you go back and take a look at everything I said at recent investor conferences as well as on the call, what I said is the back half of this year subscriber net adds would improve. We're not through the back half. We're only through Q3. And we said we had turned the corner. We were either turned at the point where we had bottomed out and turned the corner or very close. That's specifically what I said at an investor conference, all of which is true. Our sales are up year over year, and we've mentioned that the TWC churn continued to be highly elevated, and the point at which that would subside was after we've crossed the 50% mark.","So if somebody was reading in and wanted to look for monthly guidance, that's not how we operate, and we talk about things in terms of a longer-term timeframe. The back half of this year is going to be significantly improved. The revenue effects of that will continue through 2018. The benefits of the transactions, the operating and the transaction synergies, the next wave will fully flow through by 2019. And we're going to spend a lot of capital in the back half of this year, which I mentioned on those calls as well, and we're going to spend the capital next year too for all-digital.","If you go back and take a look at the way that I described the business, it was ready for analysts to be able to put a model together, and we stand behind everything that we said and the optimism that was there. I think people are taking a look at it in too short of a timeframe. And that's never how we've talked about the business or the way that we operate it.","As it relates to the balance sheet, because of all the things that I just said, we have a fundamental view on the value creation that's going to take place at Charter over time. We're not stock pickers. We don't understand the vagaries of the marketplace from day to day, and we have a fundamental view on what the long-term value creation of the company is going to be.","It looked cheap then; it looks cheap now. I haven't looked today, but it's probably a little bit cheaper than it was. But at the end of the day, the value creation is going to be significant either way. And the capital markets are good. We have a full understanding of how mixed things could look for a period of time as they got through the operating integration that applied to Q2 results. It applies to Q3 results and probably still applies a little bit to Q4 results, although it continues to improve. And so it's a great opportunity and it's a good time for all those reasons, including the debt markets being available to go do everything that we've been doing.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Just to clarify something that Chris said, we have turned the corner in terms of our operating strategy, which will produce future revenue growth in excess of current revenue growth. And the reason we've turned the corner and the way we know we've turned the corner is we have more sales than we had year over year and we have less disconnects. And that translates ultimately into more customers, higher quality of customers too through time that produce revenue and produce net gains as well. And so given the way we budgeted this business and the way we operate this business, it's almost exactly on the screws as to where we thought it would be.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Tom mentioned it in the prepared remarks. When you take a look at it from an EBITDA growth, it's performing better than what we did at legacy Charter. And we've said multiple times, when we did it at legacy Charter in 2012 and 2013, same comment. It's not going to be linear, it's going to be very choppy along the way. We know what to expect and have confidence, and that's why we've been buying back stock as well.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","We also said that we thought that these assets were in better shape than legacy Charter, and they are, and therefore we should have a little better performance.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","That's right.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Phil. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Okay, the next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I don't know if this is for Mr. Winfrey or Rutledge, but I'll just throw it out there and however you want to address it. When the buy side I think segments and thinks about buying a cable stock, those that pick your stock are I think willing to take more leverage, because they see faster growth. This year, it doesn't look like you've grown revenue or EBITDA demonstrably faster than the industry. And so as you look at all of the internal metrics that you guys are looking at that get you excited, without giving an absolute number, how much faster do you think you will end up growing than the industry grows, whatever that grows at, as we move out to 2018 or 2019?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","So it's a very smart way of asking for guidance. I give you credit, Jason. It's revolting (38:48). What we've said before remains the same is that the operating model that we have allows us to drive customer relationship growth in the, call it, 5%, 6%, 7% range, depending on the quarter and on an annualized basis. And with very little rate increase, that means that your revenue growth is going to be somewhere north of that. And that legacy Charter had demonstrated the ability to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth as a result of the operating strategy that we have that actually increases sales and reduces service calls and reduces churn, which creates further penetration on a fixed set of base and drives operating margin, leverage, operating leverage, and EBITDA margin. And none of that's changed.","And so the type of things that we did at legacy Charter is exactly what we're doing here, and we expect the same type of results and even better because of the significant synergies that the scale of the three companies combined could potentially bring.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","But just in terms of preparing the company to be in that position requires some capital in excess of what normal capital expenditures in the business would require, going all-digital, freeing up spectrum, opening up additional spectrum for high-speed data to take speeds up, to improve product sets, to remain competitive, to differentiate on a speed basis from other wireline competitors, our data business.","All of that requires investment, and it also requires repricing and repackaging of the business, which means that we have to shift customers out of existing rate structures into new rate structures, and do that in a way that doesn't cause our revenue to go backwards hopefully, and to do it in as revenue-neutral a way as we can possibly do it and continue to grow our customer base going forward so that we have long-run value propositions for the consumer. That costs money.","And in order to get to a high-quality service operation, we're in-sourcing people, which means that we have to have costs associated with that while we stand up new buildings to house these people, while we train these people in duplicate with the offshoring costs that we currently have. As those people come online and become productive, costs drop away, EBITDA growth accelerates. But we're in a moment that was planned where we would make these capital investments and make these operating expense investments and repricing investments in order to put ourselves in a position to get the double-digit growth that Chris just spoke of and which we've produced in the past and the double-digit EBITDA growth. And so we are a high-growth company, and we're executing our plan as we envisioned it.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's perfect. Thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","A final point for you, Jason.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes?","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","I think it's been now five years, four or five years. But if you go back and take a look at legacy Charter at this stage, EBITDA growth was zero, minus 1%, plus 1%. It was choppy then and it wasn't linear. And so we're at the point where we're seeing all of that and to be growing at 5% EBITDA growth throughout that. And we had a similar capital structure philosophy back then too. It all is consistent and just requires taking a look at it on an annual and multiyear view as opposed to a quarterly view.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood, thank you.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jason. Michelle, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I want to talk about wireless. You mentioned you're still on track to launch the wireless product in the first half of next year. And you noted that you're actually leveraging the cooperation agreement with Comcast. So I was curious if you can maybe elaborate on that. To what extent are you guys actually doing cooperative work? And are you starting to discover that there may be ways you guys can actually collaborate together in wireless on a long-term basis beyond the scope of the one-year agreement you have in place?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","As part of that agreement, we said that we were going to work together to try to form a cooperative relationship to manage the Wi-Fi or to manage the MVNO that we jointly both share with Verizon. And we've made good headway with our relationship with them and we've learned a lot from them. And we have an opportunity together to run the business more effectively from a back-office perspective.","And so we're looking forward to entering the wireless business by the second quarter of next year and being operational. We're doing field testing today with our own employees.","We're also doing other kinds of wireless testing that is unrelated to this MVNO entry, but the learning that we've received from Comcast has been very helpful to our implementation strategy. And we share many of the same, if not all the same, vendors from an operational and provisioning and back-office infrastructure perspective. So we're using their experience today to make our experience and our customer service experience better.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Is there any actual joint collaborative operations, or is it still all consultative and informative and educational at this point?","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","I think there's the potential for something along those lines, but there's nothing to announce here today.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right, thanks for taking the question.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Brett. Michelle, we can take our next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning. Tom, just continuing on wireless, you sound particularly excited or interested in looking at fixed wireless, some of the small-cell stuff you were mentioning. I'm curious if you could expand on how you think about deploying that in your business and what the revenue opportunities are and if this 3.5-gigahertz CBRS spectrum is of potential interest to the cable industry and to Charter.","And then, Chris, just going back to the quarter, can you give us a little more color on the legacy Charter subscriber performance? I think you mentioned you thought some of the year-over-year declines in broadband and video were temporary in nature. You might have mentioned some comp issues. But just any more color since we all look to that performance as a bit of a leading indicator for the rest of the business.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","So, Ben, we have an existing Wi-Fi business, meaning that our data business is delivered by Wi-Fi. There are 200 million Wi-Fi devices currently connected to the Charter high-speed data plan physical infrastructure. So we operate small-cell high-capacity networks in homes today, which is what 5G envisions to be and some of the new spectrum that may become available envisions to be able to provide.","We think that the Wi-Fi technology that we deploy will get better and allow us to take speeds up over 1-gig in the home with better control over those devices connected to the Wi-Fi network in the home. We think that the outdoor deployment of Wi-Fi will enhance our ability to reduce our MVNO costs as well as our ability to reduce those MVNO costs in the home.","And we think that new services will come along, which will allow us to use the new spectrum in a mixed way using 5G technology. We think the mixed way, meaning a combination of licensed spectrum with Wi-Fi spectrum, and I called that jokingly 6G the other day. But we have an opportunity to use all of the tools at our disposal to create products that we think work on our network better than any other deployed network currently in existence.","And so we think that there's a tremendous opportunity not just to have a MVNO and a mobile business, but to create new products in a fixed environment. And that may mean specific point-to-point products that allow us to get to buildings that we don't serve currently in a less expensive way. That's a simple across a parking lot for commercial services type deployment, but also to reaching unserved rural areas and also to creating brand-new products that don't even exist today that require high capacity, low latency, high-compute networks, what people think of as virtual reality products.","So we're going down the path in investing in our network for a future that we see as very bright, which is high-capacity wireless attached to high-capacity wireline. And we have a pathway and a development pathway to get to 10-gig symmetrical on our wireless, Wi-Fi, and wireline networks, and we think we can get there relatively quickly. And when we do, a whole new set of products will become available on that technology platform that don't exist today, as well as all the existing products that we do have will work better.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","The second question was on legacy Charter.","Thomas M. Rutledge - Charter Communications, Inc.","Legacy Charter is the fastest growing piece we have in this business. And it has quarterly challenges year over year, including the hurricanes, including the fact that one of our biggest operations, many of our operations in legacy Charter were subsumed into legacy Time Warner operations. Like our LA footprint, for instance, had our second biggest operating platform go into a legacy Time Warner platform from a managerial point of view. So those transition issues affect our year-over-year growth, but our year-over-year growth is good in legacy Charter.","And yes, there are some competitive changes that have occurred in the wireline business. AT&T has expanded its footprint that's consistent with its commitment to the FCC in the DIRECTV acquisition, and we've had to respond to that. But the general situation is that business is performing nicely. The change year over year isn't significant on a relative basis. And it's still performing better than any part of the company we have, and we expect that to continue.","But some of the change that would have occurred in legacy Charter didn't occur because of the transition process. The user interfaces in Los Angeles, for instance, are still the old ones, and because of the integration issues we had to delay that. So generally, I would say that everything we expect out of legacy Charter is working. There are some additional competitive pressures, but in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty much on track.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Michelle, I think we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Okay, so our final question for today will be John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys, maybe just two quick ones. First for Chris, given the equation that you laid out in terms of attractive capital markets and the discount in the stock and confidence in the numbers as we look out to 2018, what are the chances that you guys could actually exceed that 4.5 times leverage limit, at least temporarily? So that's number one.","And then number two, I guess similar to Ben's question, if we drill down a little bit on the video losses, maybe this time in the Time Warner Cable markets, there I think you pointed to some churn in the limited basic set. Can you give us a sense of how far through that process we are? Maybe you don't want to give us how many limited basics you have in the base, but how long you expect that trend to continue. Thanks.","Christopher L. Winfrey - Charter Communications, Inc.","Sure. Look, we're committed to the target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. And I won't lie to you, it's tempting if you see a big market opportunity open up but the credibility that we have in the debt capital markets is equally important to what we have with the equity capital markets. And we're not going to sit here and willy-nilly just start moving that around.","So we're committed to the target leverage range that we have. It will move at the bottom end, as it has. It will move to the top end over time and then back depending on the strategic organic and inorganic opportunities that are in front of us. That's our target leverage range. We talked at length on multiple occasions about what are the factors that we look at that would cause us to alter that. None of that's the case.","For TWC, I'll say also we've had the benefit of looking back at what I said in the past couple quarters. It's the same I said before, unlimited basic. The minute we get over 50% migration into Spectrum pricing and packaging, the weight of those declines starts to subside. And particularly as the sales continue to increase year over year, then the pressure really goes away. So that crossover point will be reached relatively fast. We're already starting to see, as you would expect, continued better sales, a better output from the base that's been migrated, and things from the legacy TWC perspective will just continue to get better from here.","It's difficult to project the exact month or day that you'll cross over, but I think legacy Charter in terms of its migration path has been nearly spot-on in terms of how we're migrating this space and continues to serve as a good proxy in that regard.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Stefan Anninger - Charter Communications, Inc.","Thanks, John. That's it for our call today. Back to you, Michelle.","Thomas M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Charter's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Robin Gutzler. You may begin your conference.","Robin Gutzler","Thank you, Dawn. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a press release over PRNewswire at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we do encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","In today's release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma results for 2011. The pro forma results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011, unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.","The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thank you, Robin. Over the past year, we implemented a new strategy for Charter in terms of providing a superior product, reorganizing the business and how we price and package our product. We have made significant progress. We accelerated our underlying subscription revenue growth and grew revenue over 4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and our growth rate was increasing during the quarter. We also added 20,000 residential customer relationships compared to 5,000 in the prior year, our best fourth quarter performance in 10 years. And we gained nearly 110,000 residential customer relationships over the past 12 months.","While our video subscription units declined in the quarter, we lost fewer units than we did a year ago and the quality of our video customer base and the video packages we're selling are significantly better. In fact, if you include limited basic video customer losses -- if you exclude video limited video customer losses, our video losses were just 12,000 for all of 2012. Our triple play connect rate in the quarter was 36% of video connects, which is a significant improvement, and we've seen sell-in in the past few weeks get as high as 50%, which is where we'd like to be consistently.","Triple play ARPU at acquisition during Q4, was $120, despite our $90 promotional price, indicating a higher sell-in rate of ancillary services. In just 6 months, 30% of our total customer base is now on our new pricing and packaging, which means these customers are receiving a truly competitive product, are less likely to drive transactions and less likely to churn or either migrated in the old pricing or will be stepping up after the promotional period. Fundamentally, we're getting a better return on our investment for newly acquired customers.","On the commercial side, we continue to drive revenue growth for the year by over 20%. Even with all of the operating changes and investment, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 1.7% in the quarter. The objective is to do much more over time now that we've completed our organizational changes.","On our last call, I outlined the many changes we're making in our business, but we're also making the appropriate investments to take better care of our customers and our key strategic asset, our 2-way plant. Not only will these investments normalize over time, but they position us for faster residential top line growth, which we're starting to see.","In 2013, we'll focus on 4 key areas to further our objectives and deliver more for our customers. First, we're going to continue to leverage our 2-way interactive high-capacity plant, which is competitively superior to the vast majority of our footprint. This includes maintaining superiority on our Internet speed and reliability and continued catch-up plant maintenance so we can deliver a superior product that increases the inherent architectural advantage of our 2-way plant. This allows us to differentiate ourselves from satellite and telco and take share. The other way to increase our competitive advantage is to go all-digital by the end of 2014. In essence, we've already gone all-digital from a go-to-market perspective as we stopped actively marketing analog service in the middle of last year. And we'll continue to go all-digital in a variety of ways, including continued analog channel reductions, prioritization of specific regions for full digitization now, where the benefits already outweigh the costs.","Through digitization, we unburden the plant for more HD and DOCSIS 3.0 channels and make ourselves even more competitive with a superior high-capacity infrastructure, and we're going to do that predominantly with fully functioning set-top boxes rather than DTAs in order to offer a better user interface, use our 2-way advantage and generate more revenue with a better ROI, particularly as we buy new boxes at lower cost.","A second key objective is to spend more time on our product and feature development. We're working on developing a cloud-based user interface and search service that will move key product and service functionality out of the set-top box and into the network. The goal is to enable high-quality, low-cost 2-way set-top box purchases and extend the life of our set-top boxes already deployed. We also put the building blocks in place to take more control of our customer interfaces across varying devices and platforms. An early example of that would be streaming to smart devices and a companion remote application, and we've procured content rights to stream both inside and outside the home.","While we'll develop new products, interfaces and applications, the key thing to remember is the largest value driver at Charter is our operating strategy. Execution on fundamentals and getting our video, Internet and phone products into the roughly 7 million passings we have in front of us. And finally, we'll continue to capitalize on the $9.5 billion commercial market within our footprint, a business that remains in its early stages and has a significant room for additional growth.","Before I wrap up and turn the call over to Chris to give fourth quarter details, I'd like to mention the deal we recently announced to acquire the former Bresnan properties from Cablevision. These markets are similar to Charter in terms of demographic profile and competitive overlap. The operations have been structured the same as what we are implementing today at Charter, pricing and packaging, product improvements, organizational design and network configuration, only the Bresnan properties are 2 years ahead of Charter in terms of implementation.","The capital to position Bresnan has been spent over the past 2 years and is now declining. And the asset is growing at a faster rate than almost any cable system in the United States. So we're getting an asset that's accretive to free cash flow and well positioned to grow, all of which means that this acquisition is a good fit and we're looking forward to incorporating the team and its operations into Charter.","After a year at Charter, we are where I expected us to be at this stage, offering a fully competitive product and service suite, focusing on the fundamentals, taking care of our customers, all of which increasingly puts us in a position to grow faster.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chris Winfrey.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the financial results, I'd like to mention a few reporting changes we've made. We changed our homes passed and penetration disclosure to include commercial establishments in addition to residential to be more consistent with our peers. We've made some changes to our expense reporting categories in order to more closely mirror how we organize and manage the business. We hope you'll find those helpful. We've reflected both of these changes in prior periods for ease of comparison.","And now turning to Slide 5, looking at customer trends. We improved our video performance in the fourth quarter. We lost 36,000 video customers, down from 44,000 a year ago. Despite no longer actively selling analog, we saw a year-on-year improvement in video customer trends, evidence that the new approach and improved product offering is gaining traction.","As Tom mentioned, our full year spend to basic customer trends significantly improved, and we're continuing to make progress on retooling many of our sales channels, now growing those in a substantially new form. We added 54,000 Internet customers during the quarter, in line with our strategy of taking a more bundled approach. You recall that in the fourth quarter 2011, we had a $20 stand-alone Internet offer in 2011 and a low-priced 2-play Internet and phone offer in the market, which drove Internet volume. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we grew our phone customers by 34,000, better than last year, which had the low-priced 2-play offer, but phone still has room to grow.","Under the new offer strategy, customers are buying more of our product and that leads to a higher-quality relationship. You can see that higher quality in the product taken and the increased triple play penetration. While we're acquiring new customers at introductory rates, we're doing so without reducing our average revenue per customer, which totaled just under $106 in Q4. We already see benefits in non-pay and competitive churn.","Looking at Slide 6, we grew revenue by 4.3%, which is both a sequential and a year-on-year improvement. Our video revenue grew 2.8% over the prior year, the largest quarterly gain in more than 4 years, driven really by 4 factors: The quality of our subscriber development, increasing the expanded basic and digital; second, increased sale of advanced services with a higher number of boxes, all of which has revenue attached; also, promotional rates step-up discipline in early 2012 price increases; and finally, a higher amount of bundled sell-in, which results in the allocation of more revenue out of phone than in the past.","Internet revenues grew 9%, driven by the addition of nearly 300,000 Internet customers over the past year, and our phone revenues declined 14%, with the increase of phone customers more than offset by revenue allocation within the bundle.","Not including advertising, commercial and other revenue, our residential cable revenue rose 2.2% year-on-year. That compares to 1.1% in Q4 of last year, so very good early progress.","As we look to 2013, we'll continue to focus on adding new customers at introductory rates with lower upfront fees, but recurring monthly rates should start to step up. We've also implemented a rate increase effective for the end of the first quarter, which equates to about a 2.3% increase across our 5 million customer base.","Turning to commercial. For our commercial business, we again generated over 20% revenue growth. And excluding video, our commercial revenues increased by 26%. In addition in the fourth quarter, our advertising sales rose 18.5% due to a strong political quarter, as we also increased sales from the automotive sector. Excluding the election year impact, our advertising revenue would've risen by roughly 8% in the quarter and for the full year.","Moving to Slide 7. Our EBITDA was up 1.7% compared to 2011, which demonstrates solid performance given the amount of change. We have realigned our organization and restructured field operations. We're migrating to more in-house versus outsourced labor. We've revised our product and selling tactics and are redirecting various sales channels. We've revamped our sales commission structure, and we're improving the way we maintain our plant.","Total operating costs in the quarter increased 5.8% on prior year with the key cost drivers being programming and maintenance. Programming cost rose $26 million or 5.5% year-over-year. We think we can keep that growth rate in the mid- to high-single digits on a per-sub basis this year.","Maintenance expense increased $19 million in the quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, we've significantly stepped up our preventive maintenance of the plant and in doing so have identified specific regional areas which need improvement and which have an outsized impact on Charter's service rate and on the company as a whole.","We also added a fair amount of personnel in the quarter, including in-house service techs, quality control personnel and direct sales reps. The operating strategies have also driven a significant further improvement in bad debt, which declined to more than 20% on a year-on-year basis.","On Slide 8, our CapEx increased $122 million in Q4 compared to the prior year. $47 million of that increase was related to higher CPE. Fourth quarter CPE spend totaled $162 million in the following categories: About 1\/2 for capitalized installed labor for new connects; 1\/4 of that CPE spend for equipment for new customer acquisition and upgrades; and the remainder for additional equipment in existing video customers' homes.","In addition to CPE, our upgrade and rebuild capital increased $35 million over the prior year, primarily due to plant replacement in conjunction with the preventive maintenance we noted earlier. As we completed more frequent plant sweeps and increased preventative maintenance and find issues, we're incurring onetime capital, which will bring down trouble calls and churn rates.","Similar to the maintenance expense in the P&L, which identifies that capital need, there's a clear ROI attached to the spend which comes via improved operating metrics, customer satisfaction and lower churn. We expect some of this spend to continue through 2013 as we finish up the remainder of these projects. And support capital increased $13 million in the quarter driven by investment in vehicles and real estate, particularly as we in-source more of our work force.","Our fourth quarter commercial CapEx was up $13 million, and for the full year, increased $74 million to $269 million to support growth in the commercial business.","In 2013, we expect our capital investments, excluding acquisitions, to be approximately $1.7 billion, meaning that at least as a percentage of revenue, 2012 should be the peak for Charter, with the caveat being the timing, how fast we migrate to all-digital, and growth generally.","Turning to cash flow on Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $33 million, down from last year's fourth quarter due to the higher capital investment. From a balance sheet perspective, over 80% of our debt matures beyond 2016.","We ended the year with a weighted average interest cost of 6%, with a run rate interest expense of approximately $780 million. Our leverage was 4.8x adjusted EBITDA, and our leverage target remains 4x to 4.5x, plus or minus a half turn either way, to enable strategic activity.","A good example of that strategic activity is the recently announced Bresnan transaction, where we believe our leverage at closing should be about 5x.","And finally, on Slide 10, we've updated our tax asset information. As of 12\/31, we had an outsized tax basis totaling $8.9 billion, as well as NOLs of $7.7 billion. The key point about our tax assets is enhanced free cash flow conversion through at least 2017 and continuing tax benefits through 2024.","Before we open it up to Q&A, I'd like to introduce our new VP of Investor Relations, Stefan Anninger. Many of you know him well. As we moved our headquarters to Connecticut, he joined us from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse in January. Robin has done a great job, not only in managing that transition, but representing Charter with this group of stakeholders, as many of you know firsthand.","And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe some questions around margins. Obviously, programming cost growth has been one of the focuses of the quarter, and your 9.6% was solid. Can you give us an update on where you think that's trending in '13 and then your -- the ability of the company to maintain the strong margins, even with that cost growth that you've been able to post this quarter?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, John, clearly, programming is a driver of cost in the business. We do think that our margins will improve as a result of our performance operationally by taking transactions out of the business. And so the second biggest cost driver in the cable business, I think, is unnecessary physical transactions, and the way we're going to reduce those is by improving the customer proposition, therefore, improving the customer life and reducing the amount of service calls over the life of the subscriber. And that's how we take cost out of the business, and that's how margins improve.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you expect similar type of programming cost growth? Or should that accelerate? And I guess, in looking into '13, is flat margins a good place? Or do you think you can see improvement year-over-year?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Chris, do you want to answer that?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes. So we're not going to give margin guidance, but as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect that for programming for 2013, that we should be in the mid- to high-single digits on programming cost on a per-subscriber basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","It's Jeff Wlodarczak. I had a question about data additions. You talked about the fact that you had very aggressive data and double play promotions last year. What I wonder is, was there also a churn hit as those folks that were paying the $19.99 price last year churned off this year as they were repriced materially higher? And then I have a follow-up.","Thomas M. Rutledge","The way I would describe it is -- I mean, there is a churn effect from those kinds of offers, and we're essentially selling a different product today than we sold previously, and it's a richer product. And so as we drive that into the market, we're being very disciplined about the kinds of customers that we're connecting, so that the life of the subscriber and the value of the subscriber has increased. But we're putting a much different product in the hands of new customers. And in the process of changing our operation and changing essentially every reporting relationship in the company, we are gradually building back our sales capability at the same time. So you have 2 things going on. You've got old offers expiring and a different customer base essentially being transformed into a new customer base with a new product set and an operational change simultaneously that has to realize the full benefit of its implementation, and that has yet to occur.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Got it. And then if you could provide any additional color, it sounded like the first quarter trends sounded good, but any more color you can provide on how the first quarter's going? And then last year, you actually had positive sub growth there. Are you prepared to say that you could have positive sub growth in the first quarter of this year as well?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I don't want to give any more guidance than we've already given, but we did say that we were -- our triple play sell-in continues to climb to 50%, and we've been seeing that kind of result as a result of the organizational changes we've made. So our organizational efficiency continues to improve.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Russo - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Brian Russo for Doug. As you've made the service more competitive, have you noticed any response from your -- any noteworthy response from your competitors?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I haven't seen a significant change that I can articulate from any of our competitors. I mean, our national competitors, the satellite companies, I'm not sure are specifically focused on our activities. And I haven't seen AT&T, which is our primary phone competitor, change its go-to-market strategy with regard to us either.","Brian Russo - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","As a quick follow-up, what kind of further innovation do you think would be most impactful from a competitive standpoint for you guys to do?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I think our biggest opportunity is to just be a better cable operator. We have a superior infrastructure, relatively speaking, to all of our competitors. And we need to use it effectively. And our biggest effort is in putting our organization in shape, putting our plant in shape so that we can actually take advantage of our inherent strengths. And there's a lot of execution around that strategy, and we're continuing to improve in our operating metrics every day. But that's where the biggest single opportunity is, in just operating our strategic advantage effectively. Beyond that, we've started to use cloud-based guides and cloud-based searches to take advantage of a change in the world. The fact that people now have tablets and smartphones and the fact that those devices can interact with our cable system in a way that makes the video experience much better than it could be otherwise. There's inherent disadvantages to remote control devices on TVs for navigation purposes. We've found a way to take navigation from the TV and put it onto your smart device and essentially, get a whole new experience without having to recapitalize our entire set-top box universe. So it's capitally efficient and it's consumer friendly, and we're develop -- we're spending our precious development dollars in that area specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, for the last, I guess, 2 quarters now, you've been putting in a lot of changes to how you sell, how the organization sells and positions the products. Would you say that now, by end of Q4, you're sort of at where you want to be? And part of the reason I ask the question is if you look at your bundled penetration trends, they're a little surprising in that single play went up, triple play went up a little bit, double play went down. I didn't know if there were still some more, maybe noise, in the numbers and you hadn't kind of hit your full stride until Q1. You did mention that your bundled penetration -- your triple play sell-in rates continue to climb. So I wanted to ask if you could comment on sort of timing there.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, I think that's -- we have said that we continue to improve into Q1, and Q3 and Q4 were very significant in terms of structural changes we made to the company. We essentially changed every reporting relationship and changed the way we sold and priced our products, changed every commission structure we had and moved our headquarters. So all of that was quite disruptive, and we've seen -- but it's finished, and all of our people are in place and our management structures are in place, and our organization now is performing better every day than it did the prior day. And that means that we're getting a higher triple play sell-in rate and we expect continued success in improving our operations. But it's a big company and there are a lot of people involved. And it's a big job, but it's getting better consistently.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if I could just ask Chris, if you could follow up on some of your -- 2 numbers you gave on your prepared remarks. Well, I guess one number, then a question on the quarter. You said 2.3% benefit from a rate hike. Was that -- are you speaking to the customer -- revenue per customer number, the $105 you did in '12? Is that the...","Christopher L. Winfrey","What I'm speaking to, yes, effectively. We're talking -- that's the same relative metric, the 2.3% increase on average across the 5 million customer base, including video and non-video subscribers.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And Chris, any comment on the sequential decline in expenses? I know marketing was down a little bit. Other costs were down. Just given how much you were doing at the sales force and pushing your new product strategy it was a little bit of a surprise on the expense front. Any comments there?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, look, you typically see some seasonality. I think the biggest driver on the expense side was obviously programming on a year-over-year basis, but the other one, it was on the maintenance side. So I think you're picking up more on seasonality than anything else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just had a question for Mr. Rutledge. It's very kind of you to include Slide 4, which shows the Optimum West trajectory and I think a lot of investors are probably wondering sort of the timing to sort of see if there is a material inflection up on revenue, what a reasonable timing is. So I just want to check some dates and make sure I have this right. The investments, when Bresnan was part of Cablevision, you began to make those investments in the first quarter of '11, and it looks like the inflection happened about a year later, when you joined Charter, I think, in the first quarter of '12 and maybe made the investments in the second quarter of '12. Is that reasonable? And so we should sort of think of a 2Q '13 as maybe the point when it becomes obvious if there is an inflection up on the top line? Is that reasonable?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Your timing is slightly off. I would say it was more Q3 that changes were implemented. They were implemented in Q2 in the Bresnan acquisition for Cablevision.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","2Q of '11 and 3Q of '12 for Charter?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. So other than that, everything you said is correct from a fact basis. We included that because we think that the Bresnan success is indicative of what Charter can do. And it's not a 1:1 correlation. Charter is a different circumstance, but it's much larger, obviously. And therefore, it has a bigger execution concern, but we have the team and we're executing against it, and we expect that we'll have good results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, we've danced around this a little bit, but can you help us think about the sales process and the gross add momentum over the last, call it, 6 months? How do you see that sort of sales process? At what point is it normalized and up to sort of full speed? And then can you talk a little bit about the digital rollout as well -- or the all-digital rollout? Are there markets you expect to attack first there?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. So no, I wouldn't say we're at full speed yet. Q3 and Q4 were transitional quarters in terms of our capability of executing a strategy. We had to recreate our sales forces even where they are physically, how our inbound sales work, how our direct sales work, and there were a lot of people moving around in that process. As a result of that, we had achievements and additional sell-in and at higher sell-in, but we can do much better because at the same time that we were making those achievements, we were creating our own noise as a result of all of the activity and change that we created. And as I said earlier in the call, our triple play sell-in continues to improve, and I expect it to get better over time as well in other areas. The subscriber life indicators continue to improve, too, like churn continues to go down. So we think that the effect of our strategy is visible, but it hasn't been fully realized by any means. So I have higher expectations than we've already achieved there. With regard to digitization, we're going all-digital so that we can take advantage of our 2-way plant and create more value for our customers. And as part of that, we're selling our way in. And in the middle of last year, in 2012, we quit selling analog and so on the increment, we're only selling digital. And there are places where we've gotten fairly high penetration already, to the point where we're going to go ahead and turn off the analog signal and sell-in the rest of the digital product in a very short timeframe. And we're going to start doing that in places where we have the highest penetration and where we think we'll get the biggest uplift from a value proposition and where we can learn the logistical issues that we have to deal with as we go all-digital faster throughout the country. So that's our strategy. We're going to continue to sell our way in. And the higher that sell-in is, the less disruptive the all-digitization process is. In places where we've already achieved that or where we think that going all-digital faster will produce immediate results, we're going to do that. So we'll be opportunistic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions. First, I have in our numbers an expectation that ARPU will accelerate in the second half of the year because you started with your new promotion in the middle of last year. And as those promotional prices come off, we should get a lift. That's part of the thinking there. And so we've been hearing some of the other folks talking about how, when that happens, there's a high risk of churn and people want their promotional pricing. Can you sort of talk about how confident you are that you'll be able to get that ARPU lift at that point? And the second question is on -- your programming cost in 2013 look at least below where everybody else seems to be talking about programming rates, and obviously, these things are lumpy. Can you sort of talk about what is the longer-term programming rate increase per sub in your business model based on what you've seen in your contracts?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. So to your first question, yes, you're right. We started our promotional pricing in July of '12, and as a result of that, in July of '13, those promotions will start to roll off and they roll off over a multi-year period and there'll be a step-up in price. We think that because of the way we've added value to the product, that the churn will not be significant and that the net economic effect of all that will be very positive. And so that's based on our experience and it's based on our understanding of what you need to do to create a valuable product, and what our competitors' products are and how we relate to them. So these are fully featured, really good video products with lots of HD and 2-way interactivity and lots of Video On Demand, the highest, fastest speed Internet service you can buy in almost any part of our footprint and a fully provisioned voice product. And when you put it all together, it's sold at a price, even with the step-up, that's lower than you can build with going to the individual component pieces of other providers. And so we think that the value's there, that the product is superior, and that we'll be able to manage our customer relationships through Q3 and Q4 and going forward. So with regard to programming expenses, you know if you look at Charter's programming expenses as a percentage of revenue versus, say, Time Warner's and Comcast and other companies, it's higher. And so we actually think that there's some compression in the differences in prices between the big MSOs and us, and that we can actually have a lower rate of increase than other companies. But we're still already paying higher programming cost than other companies and that's how -- why we think we can get that compression to occur.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So looking forward after all-digital rollout, do you have a marketing plan that will sort of be next, anything you're going to do to sort of wrap that product around? You mentioned being able to upsell the customer and so forth and we see a lot of concepts there. We've seen some of your larger peers be pretty successful, post digital rollout, with some improved product packaging. Do you -- can you give us some idea on some plans there?","Thomas M. Rutledge","In changing our product packaging?","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, once you have an all-digital product, do you have a plan to -- for another branding strategy? Any sort of other push to sell products to customers, once you've kind of gotten all-digital? Because digital is not necessarily an end unto itself, there's other ways to sell beyond that. Just to -- is there a marketing plan there?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, well, good point. We -- some people think we should change the Charter brand and that we should add a tracker brand like XFINITY or Optimum, and we don't have anything to announce today on that. We think that we can be successful with where we are today, and incrementally, we already are selling all-digital. But the all-digital strategy is really designed to take advantage of our infrastructure. And in terms of our go-to-market product strategy, we've already implemented an all-digital strategy. In terms of additional marketing tactics, I think our biggest opportunity is to continue to develop our Internet portal, sales portal and to take advantage of Internet marketing in ways that we haven't historically as a cable company, and we've already begun to do some of that. One of the issues with Charter is its dominance, or lack thereof, of any DMA. And it's interesting that the Internet now allows us to sell in ways that we historically couldn't, and we don't necessarily need the same mass media tools that we've historically used. So we think there's some opportunity there.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one just quick follow-up. On -- with the Optimum West properties, where were they as far as SMB penetration relative to the rest of your base?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Small business penetration?","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Thomas M. Rutledge","I actually don't know off the top of my head.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","When you think -- in 2012, you talked about success-based CapEx. Does that impact your guidance for 2013 as well? If you add more video customers, is there a risk that, that goes higher? And then I guess, second question is, post-present, can you just update us on how you're thinking about acquisitions and managing your footprint versus capital returns and deleveraging?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So I'll take the capital question, Amy. You call it a risk, that if we were to grow faster than what we have as a plan. I would call that an opportunity. I mean, we have growth expectations and we have a CapEx estimate on that basis. If we're more successful, we'll spend more capital and I think all of us should be fairly pleased with that.","Thomas M. Rutledge","That's right. If we doubled our customers, it would definitely cost more.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes, and none of us here would be apologizing for it. The second question is related to the recent acquisition and how that impacts our thoughts on return of capital, and I would say it's exactly in line with everything that we've always said about our use of free cash flow strategy, which is that we have a target leverage range. We think that's the optimal place to be in terms of 4x to 4.5x, and whether it's stock buybacks, which we did in 2011, or whether it's investing significantly inside the business at a level that's not dissimilar from an acquisition, which we did in 2012, and in 2013, now investing in the Optimum West transaction. But those are what we believe the highest ROI projects at the time that we could do to use our free cash flow and we'll continue to do so, and we're comfortable up to 5x. We're also comfortable as low as 3.5x to enable some of those strategic opportunities in the future. So I think we've been very, very consistent in terms of how we've articulated our target leverage and our use of capital based on the opportunities that are in front of us. And I think we're all very comfortable where we're at from a leverage standpoint today, and that the projects that we've done so far, including the buybacks, as well as the spend that we had last year inside the business in 2012, have been highly accretive, and we have high hopes for the same with Optimum West.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just have 2 questions. Tom, you mentioned that Bresnan's 2 years ahead of Charter and CapEx is now declining. So you seem to be, I guess, indicating in some way that Charter's CapEx will decline, perhaps in 2015, as you finish the digital transition and some of the other initiatives. Just wanted to ask you if that's a reasonable interpretation of your comments. And then also, I wanted to ask on the digital conversion, are you charging for each of the set-top boxes, digital boxes, that you require the customers to take on the additional outlets as part of the conversion? And how are you executing that conversion today? Are you requiring all new customers and upgrade customers to take a box for every TV? Or are you just requiring at least one box per home? Just wanted to get a little more color on that, if you don't mind.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Okay. Well, with regard to capital and Bresnan, absent -- or including what Chris just said about success-based capital, the answer to your question is, all other things being equal, yes. It means that capital intensity goes down in the business going forward. And there is a capital expenditure necessary to get the ship moving, so to speak, and then there is success-based capital on the increment. But in general, I expect capital intensity to decline over time. With regard to set-top boxes, the answer is yes, we are charging for the additional outlets and we're charging for the set-top boxes through the conversion, which is why you want to market your way in as effectively as possible before you start try and do it en masse.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Is there a promotion where you get it, kind of like Cablevision did, where you get it for free for a year and then you start paying? Or do people have to start paying from day 1?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. There are various -- depending on the scenario, there are promotions necessary sometimes to make it go as fast as you want it to go, and we'll manage those through time as we need to. But the plan is to charge for the outlets.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.","Lance W. Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions, if I may. First, on the video side, I was happy to see the price increases and some discipline on the promotions. Could you discuss the competitive outlook there, how aggressive are you seeing the satellite guys in particular? And then on the programming side, I'm pleased to hear that you expect the pricing pressure to moderate somewhat in '13. My question is, is that due to the timing of contract renewals? Or are you seeing an opportunity, taking advantage of an opportunity, to push back a bit on some of the also-ran channels when they ask for more money?","Thomas M. Rutledge","So we are disciplined in our pricing and video promotion products. And with regard to programming, yes, we push as hard as we can push. We think that we've done a reasonably good job in negotiating contracts. Timing does matter, and different programmers have different levels of expectation and leverage. But historically, Charter has paid a higher rate for its programming than I think it should, and we're trying to get that to be more in line with other companies.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking to you again on the first quarter call.","Thomas M.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Charter Communications Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our Investor & News Center. The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risks factors and other cautionary statements contained in our 10-K filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Please also note that on July 1, Charter completed its acquisition of Cablevision's Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC, and its subsidiaries, also known as Bresnan. Unless otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to on this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as if it had occurred on July -- excuse me, on January 1, 2011. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Christopher Winfrey, our CFO. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thank you, Stefan. After reorganizing the company in 2012 and making our products and service offerings fully competitive, in 2013, we improved execution on fundamentals in our service operation and created significant momentum heading into this year, 2014.","In the fourth quarter, total residential customer relationship growth more than doubled year-over-year to 63,000 or a 3.2% gain for the full year, and we're growing market share across all products. Total residential PSU net adds grew by 147,000 in fourth quarter '13 versus 57,000 in quarter -- in fourth quarter '12.","We've stabilized our video customer base, improving our video results by 34,000 year-over-year, and we increased our multichannel market share with the expanded basic customers growing over the last 12 months. We're now well positioned from a product and service perspective to grow video customers.","We grew total revenue by 5% inside the quarter, and excluding advertising, revenue grew by 6.2%. Residential revenue grew by 4.9%, more than double last year's fourth quarter rate. And so far in this year, 2014, residential revenue is growing at approximately 6%. Commercial revenue grew by over 19% and, excluding video, grew by 23%.","EBITDA grew by 2.6% year-over-year, or 4.8% excluding the political advertising margin in the fourth quarter of '12. In full year, 2013 capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.","Sales are improving. From a customer perspective, we continue to see strong new demand for our products. Connect activity improved year-over-year by 14%, as we're improving our sales and marketing execution and providing a high-value, fully competitive product. And that improvement is occurring across all sales channels. Triple Play sell-in of video sales were at 57% in the fourth quarter, improving both year-over-year and sequentially. Involuntary churn is declining due to a better product and service offering.","The migration of our legacy customer base continues successfully with minimal disruption to existing customer relationship ARPU. 68% of our legacy customers are now on new pricing and packaging. 92% of our customers have our digital product, using 2-way HD boxes increasingly on all outlets in the home as we go all-digital. And 75% of our Internet customer base now receives data speeds of 30 megabits or more. We don't market or sell anything lower.","From a customer satisfaction perspective, as you can see on Slide 3, Charter's customer satisfaction levels are improving substantially. The improvement is being driven by the product and service operation investments we've made over the last 18 months, combined with our improving execution on a fully centralized operating strategy. And those investments are beginning to drive an overall reduction in service transactions and churn, together with increased dollars of margin on a quickly growing revenue base.","And while we're investing more in service quality to reduce total transactions, we've been able to reduce unit cost on higher-quality CPE by roughly 50% over the last 2 years, given our FCC waiver on cable cards, downloadable security strategy and volume buys. Ultimately, our investments are leading to higher revenue per relationship, lower transaction costs, higher customer satisfaction and greater customer and revenue retention at promotional roll-off, all positioning us well for significant free cash flow growth and greater cash flow growth per home passed.","In 2014 -- before I turn the call over to Chris, there are a few objectives for 2014 to highlight. First, we want to continue to improve service operations to drive our growth and financial objectives, the fundamental blocking and tackling of a high-volume transaction business. Second, to accelerate our product development in 2014, we continue to develop a cloud-based user interface for television displays, which, if all goes according to plan, will be available on every single set-top box in every one of our video customer homes. Our Charter TV app for tablets and smartphones launched in early November and allows for streaming of live cable channels inside the home. It also acts as a touch-screen guide, remote for set-top boxes and has the same look and feel as our new cloud-based user interface for set-tops. Our goal is to offer a richer user interface with a consistent look and feel. We anticipate adding more features to the TV app, including VOD both inside and outside the home.","Finally, the most important objective in 2014 is to transition the balance of our network to all-digital. At the end of 2013, we've completed approximately 15% of our all-digital initiative, and we plan to be all digital by the end of this year. This initiative allows us to unleash the full capacity and -- or full capability of our plant by unburdening our network from analog signals, giving us more network capacity to differentiate our products from those offered by satellite and telco competitors. By the end of this year, we'll be offering a superior product across the vast majority of our footprint, including, as you can see on Slide 4: more than 200 channels of HD, more than satellite, with digital pictures, an interactive programming guide and full Video On Demand on every single TV outlet; minimum Internet speeds of 60 megabits for newly migrated Internet customers and, in some areas, minimum Internet speeds of 100 megabits; fully featured voice at a competitive price, all giving us the ability to offer the best products in the market at a superior price point, whether at promotional rate or full price.","At the same time we take areas all-digital and deliver a superior product and service, we'll reestablish Charter in its new competitive light under the Charter Spectrum brand. So we've fundamentally transformed this company in 2 years. We're pleased with how we finished 2013, and we're very optimistic about 2014 and the strong start we've had so far. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. As a reminder, unless otherwise stated, the results we're discussing and showing in today's slides are presented on a pro forma basis as if we had acquired Bresnan on January 1, 2011.","Turning to Slide 5 of today's presentation, total customer and PSU trends improved across our residential and commercial businesses during the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, with PSU net add growth of 158% and 50% [ph], respectively. We are gaining market share across all products with high-value, fully competitive products, which are designed to stick. We lost 2,000 residential video customers during the quarter versus 36,000 last year, a 34,000 improvement.","Q4 video results include about 5,000 in bulk digital upgrades, but our residential video customer base was effectively flat during the fourth quarter. Looking over the last 12 months, which removes the impact of Q4 seasonal downgrades to limited basic, we grew residential expanded basic customers, indicating that we are starting to take back share in multichannel video.","Expanded customers now make up 93% of our video base. We also added 93,000 residential Internet customers during the quarter versus 59,000 during the fourth quarter last year. And we added 56,000 residential phone customers in fourth quarter versus 34,000 a year ago.","Residential customer relationship growth accelerated sequentially to 3.2%, as Tom mentioned, while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.1%. The net result is that we grew residential revenue by 4.9%. And excluding Bresnan, which we're quickly returning to growth, Charter grew residential revenue by 5.0%.","I'd like to make a quick point regarding the lower ARPU growth we saw this quarter. The continued migration of legacy customers to our new pricing and packaging at a faster rate than planned has put some near-term pressure on customer relationship ARPU. 68% of our legacy customers are now in our new pricing and packaging. And as the final waves of this migration take place, there's a higher mix of price-sensitive customers that are migrating, some of which are migrating from higher legacy price points into lower current pricing with more video and Internet product, which ultimately leads to step-ups with lower churn and results in far better ROIs. We continue to see higher average dollar step-ups and better retention at promotional roll-off for customers that we acquired approximately 10 -- 12 months ago. So our plan to maintain customer rates is fully on track.","Turning to commercial, we added 18,000 PSUs versus 12,000 last year. And as Slide 6 shows, commercial revenue grew by 19.4% and by 23.3% if you exclude the lower growth video base in commercial. We expect continued success in the $9.5 million B2B communications market in our footprint, where we offer more value to business customers.","Looking at adjusted EBITDA and expenses on Slide 8. Programming expense grew by $38 million and accounted for over 45% of the increase in total operating expense growth year-over-year. On a per expanded [ph] customer basis, programming cost grew by 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.1% for the full year, consistent with our expectations. As our video base has now stabilized and expanded customers as a percentage of our video customer base grows, programming expense dollar growth will reflect both rate and volume growth, which means that 2014 programming expense growth may look more like our competitors and peers, albeit for slightly different reasons.","Cost to service customers, which includes field operations, network operations and customer care costs, declined modestly on an absolute basis year-over-year. Ongoing service quality investments are now being offset by lowering transaction costs per dollar of revenue.","Marketing spend was higher by $21 million or up 20% year-over-year, given the higher sales activities and channel development, which we see as a positive. Other costs grew by $28 million or 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher labor cost to support commercial revenue, higher collection cost related to sales growth and overhead related to our insourcing activities, and in that order.","So in total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $19 million or 2.6% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of $16 million of political advertising margin in the fourth quarter of 2012, our EBITDA growth would've been 4.8%, and that includes higher expenses for higher customer growth, which we saw in our PSUs and customer adds inside the fourth quarter.","Looking at Slide 9, capital expenditures totaled $566 million during the quarter or $1.83 billion in 2013, including Bresnan for the period we've owned it, and that's in line with the estimate we provided. On a pro forma basis, full year capital expenditures totaled $1.85 billion. Just over 45% of our 2013 CapEx was driven by CPE to support new customer acquisition, upgrades and digital box migration of existing customers. Looking at full year 2014, we expect to spend approximately $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Of that total, approximately $400 million will be driven by our all-digital initiative, primarily digital set-tops and installation costs exclusively related to the migration dates by market and being onetime in nature. Also in the $2.2 billion is $100 million to support our insourcing activities for field operations, customer care and ITE [ph], which includes real estate, trucks, tools, test equipment and standing up our own platforms instead of relying on third-party vendors, also, in essence, onetime in nature.","Keep in mind that our full year capital expenditure estimate reflects an aggressive plan for customer growth, seeking additional 2-way boxes with each add, and our digital -- and our all-digital initiative as well. So our capital spend could be lower than $2.2 billion, although that's not our goal.","Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $84 million compared to $33 million on an actual basis during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA and contribution from trade working capital, offset by higher capital expenditures.","During the fourth quarter, Charter liquidated one of its tax partnerships, which resulted in a step-up in tax basis of approximately $400 million and provided a onetime benefit to GAAP tax expense of $36 million. This onetime benefit was a key driver of the positive net income that we had in the fourth quarter.","Looking forward, based on the updated tax assets shown on Slide 12, we do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer until at least after 2018.","We ended the quarter with $14 billion -- $14.2 billion of net debt and a leverage ratio of 4.8x on an LTM basis. Our weighted average borrowing cost remains 5.6%. And Slide 11 shows the weighted average life of our debt is 7.4 years, with over 95% of our debt maturing beyond 2016.","So we finished the year with $1.1 billion of total liquidity, and we have a balance sheet which is comprised of low-cost debt, long-dated maturities and significant flexibility. And the balance sheet is well designed to support our Triple Play growth strategy and benefit significantly from our significant tax assets.","As we complete our all-digital initiative at the end of this year, Charter is poised to substantially grow free cash flow in 2015 and beyond.","Now I'll pass it back to Tom for some final comments.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Chris. Before I pass it back to the operator for questions, a few words on the recent events surrounding M&A. Last week, we nominated a slate of directors for Time Warner Cable. Notwithstanding everything that's happened, we are still interested in wisely acquiring subscribers through M&A where that opportunity arises.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess the big question today is about the CapEx, $2.2 billion this year, and I understand the extra spending. Can you help us think about the '15 levels? You -- we've talked before and talked about normalizing back toward the industry in '15. And as we think about -- assuming you get the $2.2 billion spent this year, as we think about normalizing back, should we think about that as back to sort of a '13 level? Or could it -- that be back to be a more something closer to the industry percent of revenue?","Thomas M. Rutledge","All right. Why don't you take that, Chris?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Sure. So the CapEx for this year is $2.2 billion. And what we wanted to make sure people understood is there's $400 million of all-digital that's onetime in nature, as well as $100 million of insourcing activities. So we're not going to give guidance for 2015 or beyond. The biggest reason is it's highly contingent on growth. I mean, even if you look in 2013, when we were making a fair amount of transformation, 45% of our expenditure in CapEx was tied to CPE, and that all has revenue attached to it. So in some sense, it's our view, and we think it should be the view of shareholders as well, that to the extent we're spending on CPE and growing the business and it has revenue attached to it, people really should be cheering us on to go spend that capital. So if you take the $2.2 billion and you back off the $500 million of onetime, you get to $1.7 billion. And if you start to consider some of the things that Tom mentioned about what we're already seeing in the residential revenue growth rates inside this quarter and put those pieces together, I'd say you have a highly fast-growing cable business that is spending capital to generate that growth. And when the $500 million is no longer there in 2015, you get a significant increase in free cash flow, and we're highly confident of that. But the forward CapEx is going to be a driver of growth. And absent that growth, which we think is outsized relative to industry, there's nothing unique or structurally different about Charter that would cause it to spend more on a percentage of revenue relative to others.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, I'd just add that capital, from an efficiency perspective, on an incremental dollar of revenue and on an incremental box basis for CPE, continues to go down. So assuming that we grow our revenues and assuming that we create good customer relationships, which we expect to do, the actual cost of capital per customer is declining, relatively speaking, because boxes are getting less expensive. And that's due to Moore's Law, but it's also due to the fact that we're buying them from different vendors now. We have the ability to download security and pick different -- and get out of the historic buying patterns that we were in. And as a result of that, and along with cloud-based infrastructure, our capital costs are actually declining on a per unit basis.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And as we think about the $400 million, does that essentially get the all-digital transition done? You've gone back to, essentially, every home and inserted the number of boxes that need to be in front of every TV?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just -- you've done all-digital in 15% of the market. Can you give us any early indication on what, in those markets, you're seeing on subscriber trends, margins and just return on investment? And I have a follow-up.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Okay. So we are growing where we've gone all-digital. And Chris, do you want to...","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes. Look, we're growing video. In the markets where we've gone all-digital, we're growing video. And it's not just improving on video; we're performing better across all products in those markets where we've gone all-digital relative to those where we have yet to go all-digital, so...","Thomas M. Rutledge","And you can see that the performance of the company, from an RGU perspective, is already accelerating. And only 15% of it through the fourth quarter was all-digital. So it's a combination of the all-digital impact but, even more significantly, just the cleaning-up of the operation and the creation of a better product set and value proposition for consumers, which is driving accelerating RGU growth. But interestingly, in the 15% footprint, it's even greater proportionally.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, just on the cost side, other expenses up 15% for the quarter. Is that the run rates when we start thinking about 2014?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Look, I don't want to provide, particularly, guidance on a line-by-line basis. But if you think about what's inside that number, the biggest drivers there are growth in commercial, and that's to be able to onboard a higher level of growth that's taking place inside commercial; as well as increased collection cost, given the fact that we've increased sales by 14% year-over-year. And some of that, just by nature of bringing in higher sales, drives some of that. We also changed some of our methodologies in there, which should be onetime in nature, meaning a plateau at a higher level. So I wouldn't expect that to continue to accelerate. And then the third area is, not to get into the mundane, but as you insource labor, then things like property tax and insurance and all that kind of good stuff flows in there. So that's going to be very much tied to the insource. But the biggest driver there is really growth. When you think about the other operating expense the same way as the marketing expense -- I mean, look, marketing expense was up $21 million year-over-year, but that's tied to that higher sales growth. That's commissions. When you look at EBITDA for the quarter, you may have to get your head around a couple of things. One is, there was $16 million of political advertising margin that wasn't there. And second is the market expense that's driving growth, so you can decide for yourself how you want to look at that $21 million. And the third one is, as you highlighted, the other expense, the majority of which is driven by growth as well. And those all factor in to the 2.6% growth; or if you want to exclude margin, political margin, 4.8%; or if you want to do a growth-adjusted, it ends up being something higher than that. So I think those are the right ways to think about those cost elements.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I just had a question on CapEx. You said something on the call that sort of piqued my interest. You said that there's nothing structural about Charter that suggests its capital intensity should be different than peers'. And I was just going back to my model. I don't know, it goes back to like the Jerry Kent days through the Neil Smit days. And I've never seen Charter sort of generate a CapEx-to-rev number that's sort of in line with peers. So can you -- I assume that's because it's a revenue question, but what is the right parameter we should be using to sort of think about when you could glide into a peer level of CapEx-to-revs?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, I think that what Chris meant was that, if we were not growing, our capital expenditures on the same infrastructure would be very similar to anyone else's. There's nothing inherently different about the physical infrastructure and the need for capital at Charter relative to any other operator. We do think that we will grow faster than the rest of the industry, but we think we have that opportunity because of the way Charter was managed in the past and because of the kinds of penetration that it currently has. And so adjusted for growth, we think we're very similar, and growth capital will be a function of how fast we grow.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But when you're all done -- let's say that you're successful with your plan. Do you think, when it all settles out, that you will have higher CapEx-to-revs versus peers?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes. And we hope we do because it will be driven by growth.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two things. First, you guys said that you saw 6% residential revenue growth thus far in 2014. Should we expect that to continue to accelerate as we move through the year? And then there's been lots of commentary on the call here about -- on the cost side, different cost items. Is there another incremental cost that comes with all of the installation of the new boxes and the move to all-digital? And then, I guess, summarizing that side, can we expect margins to be up year-over-year or flattish?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, I think our revenue growth will accelerate. And the reason I think that is because our sales were accelerating and our Triple Play sell-in was accelerating. And the numbers that we're generating today can translate into future higher growth rates. In terms of cost for capital associated with all-digital, it's all in there in our estimate. And it's onetime in nature and goes away at the end of the project, which ends at the end of this year. And from -- I don't know if there was anything else...","Christopher L. Winfrey","Margin -- look, we don't want to provide margin guidance, but if you look at the categories, we've given some color on programming, where we expect to -- we've stabilized, and we expect to be growing our expanded video customer base and return that category to growth, which means that you're going to add pressure on programming not only through rate, which everybody faces, but also in volume. On the marketing side, it's tied to growth. And we look at marketing and sales expenses somewhat of a different category because it's tied to the growth. And -- but the key one, and I think people will pick up on it as they start to look through the numbers, is the cost to serve, some of the onetime investments that we had made to bring the service cost to a higher quality level. It has stabilized, and I think that puts you in a position where, growth adjusted, you're in a good position from a margin perspective.","Thomas M. Rutledge","The way I would describe margin -- I do expect margins to grow, and I expect them to grow adjusted for sales activity and other things of that nature. But fundamentally, you have cost structures associated with programming, which are growing rapidly. And that's an issue, a negative issue in the business. But the creation of high-quality customers that have -- that are satisfied with our customer service creates longer-lived customers and creates customers that have less service calls and transactions per dollar of revenue. And so the margin that comes from operating the business is improving, and we expect it to continue to improve as we get more and more customers into more valuable, less transaction-intensive packages. And that is rapidly occurring. We've gotten 68% of our customer base already into the packaging and pricing scenario. And as a result of that, service calls are dropping, satisfaction is going up, and customer life is expanding, all of which reduce cost and improve margins.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. So just following up on cost a little bit, as you are accelerating the rollout of these all-digital boxes over the course of next year, could you give us some idea about the amount that you expect to spend on OpEx, which is the truck rolls or when you put in a new box within a house and so on, how those statistics change? And secondly, just on a consolidation question, I mean, you obviously mentioned you are still open to these transactions. But just given the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, how do you look at the landscape right now? And purely in terms of size, is there a threshold for you that you need to get up to in terms of scale for a consolidation to make sense?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Right. Well, first of all, the cost of putting the boxes in is fully capitalized, including the placement of the boxes. So when the project is complete, there's no significant OpEx cost to operating the business. I mean, you could argue having more boxes per home means you could have more box failure per home, therefore higher service calls, but that's actually offset by the higher quality of the service overall and the total number of transactions associated with it. So it's actually a cost reducer to have a better product. But there is no OpEx cost, essentially, associated with the all-digital project. With regard to consolidation and the scale and landscape, I don't want to talk about specific opportunities, but we've always thought that the biggest opportunity Charter has is to grow penetration against the 7 million passings that we have a fully deployed plant in front of today and no subscriber relationship. That's where the biggest ROI is. And if Charter does that successfully, we'll create enormous value for our shareholders. So any -- and I don't think the landscape changing precludes us of realizing that opportunity. That said, if the landscape changes in such a way that we see an opportunity, we'll be opportunistic and take advantage of it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Chris and\/or Tom, one of the motivations in looking at Time Warner Cable was to try to reset your programming costs. Can you talk about -- it seemed like nothing else out there would have the same impact on programming costs that something of the scale of TWC would have. Can you talk about how you think about programming costs going forward, and are there alternative mechanisms that you've got to be able to manage that cost item in the absence of a significant change of scale?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Craig, this is Tom. I'm not sure that even all of Time Warner and Charter together would meaningfully change our scale from a programming cost perspective. We'd be the size of DISH and smaller than DIRECT and smaller than Comcast. And so it did have a marginal improvement immediately through synergy and the structure of the deal that we had proposed, but from an overall change-of-landscape scale perspective, that wasn't our main motivation.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Or the value creation.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Or how the value got created or will get created. The opportunity for us is to grow the cash flow per home passed in front of a plant that is essentially underpenetrated. And we brought tax assets and onetime synergies to the program, but the big driver is selling more cable to people who aren't buying it today. But when you look at the competitive landscape, I think that, while our costs are going up with programming, so are our competitors'. And when I look at our overall product mix and how that stacks up relative to our competitors, I think we have a superior infrastructure, a superior product and a superior customer service organization, potentially, and that all of that, combined, gives us the big opportunity. But as I said earlier in my comments, programming is an issue, and it's not unique to us, and I don't think we could solve it through an M&A the size of Time Warner. And if Time Warner is not available, think about the whole landscape out there. It's very hard to put together a scale that would really meaningfully change it.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Tom, if I could ask a follow-up, then. Have you taken a position yet on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal from a regulatory perspective? I would think that, that actually is large enough to bend the curve. And would you see bending the curve for one player beneficial to Charter or detrimental to Charter?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'm not going to comment on that. I haven't taken a position.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just had a few questions. First, on CapEx. Chris, can you tell us how much CapEx there was in '13 for all-digital? And then I just wanted to clarify, on the all-digital conversions, are you turning off all of the analog, or are you keeping, say, the limited basic channels on analog? And then the other question I had is on the rebrandings. How are you going about the timing of the rebranding? Is that all at once? Is it market-by-market? And are there going to be any significant OpEx to execute the rebranding?","Christopher L. Winfrey","I'll answer the first question, which is just a simple answer. The all-digital cost was -- it was south of $100 million inside of 2013, so it was under $100 million.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And yes, we'd turn off all analog signals, including limited basic. So the plant is fully digital, fully 2-way interactive on every outlet we deploy.","Christopher L. Winfrey","The rebranding...","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, the -- well, the rebranding is working in a way that, as we go all-digital, we get the set-top boxes placed out in specific geographies. We then launch a suite of 200 new HD channels on -- in total on top of the 100-plus that we currently have. And then we take the speeds up on our data service, and we begin to describe all of that as Charter Spectrum. And it's not really a significant change in marketing cost because we're already branding and marketing the company as Charter. But as we transform the product set and make it superior to anything that our competitors provide or anything that Charter has ever provided in the past, our thought is that we can begin to create a new sub-brand like Optimum at Cablevision or XFINITY at Comcast and use that to associate a brand notion with the high-quality products that are being presented in the marketplace. But from a cost of marketing perspective, the same mail pieces, the same broadcast advertising, the same radio advertising and on-channel promotions are done at the same rate, regardless of whether we call ourselves Charter or Spectrum or anything in between.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions. My first is on ARPU. Chris, you made some comments in your prepared remarks about the step-down from Q3 to Q4. I was just wondering if you could revisit that and flesh it out for us a bit. I know there was an expectation that, as the promotional roll-offs continued from last year, you would see that sort of build. So maybe if you could just add some color there. And I have a follow-up.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Sure. The simplest way to think about ARPU is that everybody wants to be really simplistic and just take a look at gross adds and to take a look at the roll-off of rate. But the reality is that these businesses have a tremendous amount of transactions that are taking place in the meantime. That includes migration of legacy to new pricing and packaging. And in the early days of that migration, it was giving us significantly lifts. And today, it's neutral or slightly negative. But those customers are getting a much higher-value product, and they're getting more video, more Internet product, and they're getting fully featured phone. So we're still happy to do it. So there is a short-term temporary drag that's taking place as we continue to migrate legacy package customers were a little bit more price-sensitive into the new pricing and packaging, if for no other reason they have no other rate place to go to, to be able to get that better value. The -- I want to be really clear. The customers that we acquired inside of the back end of 2012, they are rolling off, and we are getting the rate that we intended to get, and we are retaining a much higher percentage of those customers. So the model is entirely intact. But when you're looking at the amount of customers of your overall base that could have come in inside of Q4 2012 relative to the total number of transactions that are taking place in the systems, it's relatively small. And once we get through the migration, then you will see the lift that we see on a daily basis as those customers are rolling off to a higher rate and being, over time, retained at a better rate with a better product and producing lower churn.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That makes sense. And just going back to CapEx, and I ask the question sort of in the context of thinking about longer-term capital intensity and sort of the relationship between this all-digital project and underlying growth. I'm a little bit shocked that the all-digital project is a $500 million project. So I'm just curious how you think about just normal digital set-top additions, because it would seem you could, in theory, characterize all of those as benefiting all-digital. And so as we think about this project wrapping up, aren't there additional benefits to capital intensity from the fact that you've sort of placed so many set-tops in the field that will not -- you won't have to acquire as many. Even if you keep adding more subscribers, the sort of boxes per sub growth will decline. So it's a bit trying to parse how you've defined all-digital versus not all-digital on your spending.","Christopher L. Winfrey","I think that's a -- it's an important point. I mean, outside of the -- there's the $400 million. About half of that is tied to actual boxes. The rest of it is tied to the actual placement fee. But if you take a look at the question -- previous question that came from Bryan about all-digital cost, it was just south of $100 million this year for 15% of the footprint, and now we're going to do $400 million -- it's not $500 million, by the way. It's $400 million for all-digital inside 2014. You already see the efficiency that's taking place because we have more saturation of boxes being placed, we're buying boxes for much cheaper cost. Your point is that once you get beyond that, you're going to have an entire base of placed boxes that you're not going to have to acquire on the increment when you're growing. And you're absolutely right, we become more efficient over time. We have to buy less, and when we buy, we buy them at a cheaper price.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, all you're buying is incremental customer relationship boxes and lost boxes replacements.","Christopher L. Winfrey","And the other thing to keep in mind is we're not placing cheap 1-way DTAs. We're replacing 2-way Video On Demand boxes that are going to have a long life and will be placed with the cloud-based user interface over time. But they're embedded the boxes' modem, they have the 2-way interactive guide, and they have Video On Demand on every outlet. And we think that, that's a -- we think that's a pretty strong product to put in front of customers.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So talk to us a little bit about the $100 million investment in customer care. How much have you spent on sort of improving customer care? What exactly are you doing going forward? What sort of things is this going to go to and improve?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Frank, this is really just about insourcing labor across care, IT and field operations, and there's nothing horribly attractive about it other than you've got to have real estate to help those people, you've got to have trucks and tools and test equipment. And in some cases, as it relates to IT, we are putting in place hardware and software to do for ourselves what vendors have historically done for Charter in the past. And all that ties into the insourcing of $100 million.","Thomas M. Rutledge","But the reason Charter needs to do it and doesn't want to outsource is because, as Charter went through the bankruptcy process and was restructured, Charter didn't spend money on normal capital because they were trying to make debt covenants. And they didn't buy tools, test equipment, trucks. They outsourced the contractors' normal work that would be done internally. As a result of that, they had very poor customer service numbers. And so in order to fix that, Charter is running a more capital-intensive program relative to the rest of the industry to get back to a sort of normal state of affairs where we have our own service technicians who are able to do installations and service calls and we have our own call centers so that we can take phone calls and take care of customers. All of that capital has been spent over this year, over '13 and some more in '14, to get to, really, a normalized state.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First of all, to follow up on the insourcing discussion. Should we expect this to lower OpEx going forward -- once you've brought these folks in, that the cost will be lower, or is it purely the service quality improvement and, presumably, revenue associated with that? Secondly, on the decision to put full-fledged boxes on TVs rather than DTAs, can you give us an idea of what the incremental cost associated with that is on a capital side and also, if there are any incremental programming costs associated with having, for example, OnDemand and the like available to more sets in homes, beyond more customers?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'll answer the insourcing question. Yes, it actually reduced operating costs. And this is one of those situations where you can think you're saving money as an operator and actually cost yourself money. If you bring a higher quality of customer service to your customers, your customers buy more products from you, they're happier, they have less service calls. If you take care of the calls that you get efficiently, and if you fix problems the first time, the right time -- the right way, you actually end up with less activity in the business, which is the where the real cost of the business is. So insourcing, while it requires some capital, improves the quality -- assuming you manage the insourced people properly, it improves the quality of the business, which reduces the cost of the business by reducing transaction volume and increasing the life of the average customer. So 2 cable systems with the same amount of customers and the same amount of revenue per customer can have a different cost structure if one cable system has longer-life subscribers and less transactions, therefore, per dollar of revenue. And that's where the big upside in OpEx is by insourcing. Chris?","Christopher L. Winfrey","The second question -- look, I want to be careful not to give out sensitive pricing information about where we're buying boxes, but again, I just wanted to take a rule of thumb and say that the DTAs were about $50 cheaper than a fully functioning set-top box. In some sense, what you've really done is you've saved yourself, call it, just for the purpose of this example, $50, but you're going to have to come back -- if you want to have a competitive product in the household, you're going to have to come back and spend the same amount of capital anyway to put a fully functioning box on there and to put something that can have an interactive guide, that can have a modern sort of interface and that, ideally, could have Video On Demand that could allow you to compete better with satellite. So if you place a DTA, you're -- it's just throwaway spend, in our view. And so we'd rather spend capital upfront to actually get a credit from the customer for the value that you're bringing by having a better product in front of them and not to cause them a service interruption 2 times. So we'd rather spend that money upfront and actually get a better result from the customer when you've gone in and placed that box. So related to the operating cost, yes, it drives more Video On Demand. But from an operating cost standpoint, from a -- for pay Video On Demand, maybe you have margin on that, so it increases your opportunity to get Video On Demand, and you -- or you're able to charge an actual rate for the box because the box has value. So don't forget that each one of these boxes that you're placing, they have revenue directly attached to them, and it's not something that you're just giving away for life.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Just a really quick question on balance sheet capacity. Can you just lay out what the priorities are at this point between leverage, capital returns and then, I guess, M&A?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Amy, our targets haven't changed, which is our target leverage range is 4x to 4.5x. And we're about 4.8x, which is where we were last year when we acquired Bresnan. And so despite having acquired Bresnan, we're back at the 4.8x. Our target leverage is to be 4x, 4.5x. We're going to be very opportunistic and disciplined about how we use our free cash flow. In the past, we've shown an ability and willingness to buy back stock; to do M&A when it's accretive; and as of late, really, to invest in the business because we felt like that was the best ROI. We do not put out a formulaic return to capital scenario because we think it gives us the ability to do things that create the most value, and so far, that's worked very well for Charter. And there will continue to be discipline around that, both from a target leverage range as well as how we deploy capital in the future.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Could you comment on Netflix and some of the peering issues on the traffic asymmetry? And also, on Comcast-Time Warner Cable, are there any issues with some of the practices or conditions that could be imposed on the data side? They might not be binding on you but still might constitute industry practice and, more or less, consumer expectation. And then secondly, any thoughts -- more thoughts on out-of-the-home WiFi and how that could be a CapEx bucket in future years, even if it's not a priority right now?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Matthew, yes, with regard to Netflix, from what I can gather from the controversies, Netflix is putting themselves in a position to throttle their own network to try to gain sympathy in various operators, and it's an interesting approach. With regard to the Comcast-TWC data conditions, should that deal go forward and be approved, obviously, any conditions that would be accepted could have an impact on the business. And so, yes, that's an issue. And with regard to WiFi, we've spoken before about the opportunity that WiFi presents. We're putting out significant WiFi in our residential customer base. We're beginning to put it out in our commercial base. We have not gone out yet and put it in a public space, and really, that's just been a question of priority. In past operations I've managed, I've been a big proponent of WiFi. I still am, but Charter's priorities are more basic still, and we need to get our product set significantly superior to our competitors and grow our penetration. And we're focused on the day-to-day task of doing that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

Our operating strategy continues to deliver strong results and we remain focused on driving customer growth by delivering superior services and value to our customers, improving the quality of our operations by reducing unnecessary service transactions and truck rolls per customer, delivering sustainable free cash flow growth by driving EBITDA growth while reducing capital intensity; and finally, positioning our company for long-term customer relationship growth with current and new products by continuing to evolve a fully converged network that delivers high speed, low latency, seamless connectivity services inside or outside customers\u2019 homes and sanitary environment around the move. ","In 2019 we created over 1.1 million new customer relationships, substantially more than 2018. And we added over 1.4 million new Internet customers, also more than 2018. We grew our full year cable adjusted EBITDA by 6.6% in a non-political advertising year. And combined with our lower cable capital expenditures, our 2019 cable free cash flow grew by over 100% year-over-year. ","We expect that our cable EBITDA growth combined with our declining capital intensity, and disciplined capital deployment strategy will drive continued strong free cash flow growth. Our mobile business is a strategic extension of our core connectivity capabilities today and in the future and it continues to grow. We now have well over 1 million mobile lines in service with over 900,000 of those added in 2019 at an accelerating pace. ","In 2019, we saw a substantial reduction in service transactions per customer relationships. And those improvements were reflected in lower per relationship [repair] calls, trouble call, truck rolls, and billing calls. We also performed fewer physical installation truck rolls giving growing levels self-installation activity. ","Looking forward to 2020, we're well positioned to continue to reduce service activity per customer, given a higher level of customers in Spectrum pricing and packaging, the completion of our in-sourcing program and increasingly experienced in-source call center and field operation workforces, the overall improving quality, reliability and maintenance of our network, greater levels of online service activity, self-service activity and growing levels of self-installation activity as I mentioned, which in the fourth quarter exceeded 50% of sales. ","So in 2020, these lower levels of overall service activity per customer relationship should continue improvements in customer satisfaction, lower churn and reduction in cost to service customer relationship. Our in-home connectivity product set also continues to improve with 85% of our residential Internet customers now receiving minimum Internet speed of 100 megabits or more and nearly half receiving minimum speed of 200 megabits or more.","We continue to outperform in megabits, our ultra product and our gigabit speed tier across our entire footprint. We made our network capable of providing gigabit service everywhere we operate using DOCSIS 3.1 technology over the course of 13 months for $450 million planned capital. Through our 10G plan, we also have a cost efficient pathway to offer multi-gigabit speeds and lower latency to consumers and businesses that continue to attach more devices to our network, use more and more data on a daily basis, demanding greater network responsiveness and reliability.","During the quarter, we also continued to deploy our advanced home Wi-Fi capabilities to new markets beyond Austin, Texas, including Dallas, San Antonio, and closes of Southern California. Our advanced Wi-Fi capability provides enhanced security, privacy and app-based control of all IP devices in our consumers\u2019 homes, while simultaneously delivering a superior customer experience to better in-home Wi-Fi coverage, and managed Wi-Fi solutions through dynamic band switching and channel optimization within the bands. So far, our deployment has gone well and we plan to rollout this capability throughout our entire footprint. ","Our Spectrum Mobile business continues to grow quickly, and we added over 280,000 lines in the fourth quarter more than we added in the third quarter. While it's still early, we believe that our results so far indicate our mobile product drives core connectivity, customer satisfaction and will generate standalone profitability at scale. ","We also continue to test tools and technology using CBRS spectrum by small cells mounted on our own high capacity two-way network. Our tests continue to go very well. We continue to add features and functionality to our Spectrum Mobile product. And in the first quarter, we plan to offer 5G mobile service. ","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. ","Chris Winfrey ","Thanks Tom. Before covering our results, a quick reminder that we closed the sale of Navisite managed cloud services business within the Spectrum Enterprise in September. We have not prepared pro forma financials of recorded results to include Navisite in fourth quarter of 2018, but not in fourth quarter 2019. For the next few quarters, I will discuss Enterprise revenue growth including and excluding Navisite for comparability. On an annual basis Navisite generated roughly $150 million in revenue and its impact on our EBITDA and CapEx was not material.","Turning to our results on Slide 5. Over the last 12 months, we grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.1 million, or 4% and by 268,000 in the fourth quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 339,000 in the quarter and by 1.4 million or 5.6% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 101,000 in the quarter, wireline voice declined by 128,000 and we added 288,000 higher ARPU mobile lines. At the end of the fourth quarter 85% of our residential customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging. And residential customer relationship growth accelerated to 3.8% year-over-year. ","As we look at 2020 our goal is to accelerate our full year customer growth rate as we deliver highly competitive products with better service driving connects and reducing churn. ","In residential Internet, we added a total of 313,000 customers in the quarter, resulting in residential Internet customer growth of 5.4% year-over-year, driven by continuing churn improvements. ","In residential video, we lost 105,000 customers in the quarter, it\u2019s primarily driven by lower video gross additions year-over-year. And in wireline voice, we lost 152,000 residential customers in the quarter driven by lower sell-in following our transition to selling mobile in the bundle, and continued fixed and mobile substitution in the market generally.","Turning to mobile, we added 288,000 total mobile lines in the quarter driven by the value of our mobile product offers, growing brand and product awareness and increased sales effectiveness. As of December 31st, we had nearly 1.1 million lines with a healthy mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines.","Spectrum Mobile continues to scale with less EBITDA loss per line even at an accelerating net addition rate. And that does not include any benefits to our traditional cable connectivity business.","Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by just over 1 million or 3.8%. Residential revenue per residential customer relationship grew by 1.8% year-over-year given a lower rate of SPP migration and promotional campaign roll-off and rate adjustments. ","Those ARPU benefits were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, a higher mix of streaming and lighter video packages within our video base and $29 million of lower pay-per-view revenue year-over-year in the quarter. ","Our cable ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue, but Q4 especially benefited from the timing of the rate adjustments this year.","The Slide 6 shows our cable customer growth combined with that elevated Q4 ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 5.7%. ","Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 6.3% faster than last quarter as the revenue effects from the repricing of our SMB products and Legacy TWC and Bright House continues as well. SMB customer relationships grew by 6.8% year-over-year.","Enterprise revenue declined by 4.5% year-over-year driven by the sales of Navisite and the one-time cell tower backhaul fees that we mentioned as a benefit in fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding Navisite from the fourth quarter of 2018, Enterprise revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. And excluding both cell tower backhaul and Navisite, Enterprise grew by 8.5%. I expect that retail portion of Enterprise to continue to grow nicely as the wholesale piece including cell tower backhaul will continue to be challenging.","Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 23% due to less political revenue in 2019. Our non-political advertising grew -- revenue grew by 4.6% year-over-year primarily due to our advanced advertising capabilities, and recently deployed products that efficiently sell highly viewed long tailed inventory, using our own anonymized much more detailed viewing data. ","As we look to the full year 2020, we expect to continue that growth driven by our advanced advertising business and a healthy year of political revenue.","Other revenues declined by 6.6% year-over-year driven by lower processing fees and lower home shopping revenues related to video subscriber declines partly offset by higher levels of videos CPE sold to customers. Mobile revenue totaled $236 million with $138 million of that being device revenue. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 4.7% year-over-year. Cable revenue growth excluding mobile was 3.4% or 5.2%, when excluding advertising in both years and Navisite in 2018.","Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter total operating expenses grew by $165 million or 2.3% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses excluding mobile were essentially flat or up 0.6% when excluding Navisite. And that's despite strong relationship and revenue growth. Programming increased to 0.6% year-over-year, due to higher rates that was offset by video customer decline of 2.8% year-over-year, a higher mix of streaming and lighter video packages such as Choice and Stream and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the $29 million of lower pay-per-view revenue I mentioned. ","Looking at full year 2020, we expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 4.3% and that was driven by higher costs of video CPE sold to customers and original programming costs. Cost to service customers declined by 2.3% year-over-year, compared to 4% customer relationship growth. ","So we're meaningfully lowering our per relationship service costs through a number operating, quality and efficiency improvements, which is core to our strategy. Key metrics like calls per customer, truck rolls per customer and churn, self-install rates all continue to move in the right direction as Tom mentioned. ","Looking ahead, we expect further decline in cost to service customers on a per customer relationship basis but this quarter\u2019s level of operational productivity was exceptional and it will be replicated every single quarter. Cable marketing expenses increased by 2.1% year-over-year, and other cable expenses were down 1.4% driven by lower ad sales costs, which reverses in a political year, and lower costs related to the sale of Navisite, which will carry through the third quarter of this year. ","Mobile expenses totaled $372 million and they were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and usage costs and operating costs to stand up and operate the business. Our 2020 mobile EBITDA probably looks similar to 2019 due to growth and the scale of costs. But looking at it further, our current expectation is that in 2021, our mobile service revenue will exceed all regular operating costs, excluding acquisitions and growth related mobile costs.","Turning to EBITDA, we grew total adjusted EBITDA by 8.8% in the quarter when including the mobile EBITDA startup loss of $136 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.9% in the fourth quarter, including a roughly 3% negative growth rate impact from advertising revenue net of its associated expense in both periods. ","Turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $714 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter versus $296 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and the loss on financial instruments in the prior year period partly offset by higher income tax expense. ","Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.3 billion in fourth quarter with the cable CapEx declining about $200 million year-over-year, driven by the same CPE trends, DOCSIS 3.1 benefits and lower in-sourcing and integration costs I\u2019ve mentioned throughout the year. We spent $151 million in mobile related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in-support capital, it was driven by software and development costs and retail footprint upgrades for mobile. ","In 2020, we expect our mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2019 and then decline meaningfully in 2021 as that work will be behind us. And mobile CapEx outlook excludes any potential mid-band Spectrum acquisition build out, which would be based on a separate ROI evaluation. ","In 2020, we expect our cable CapEx intensity to continue to decline from the 15% in 2019. And on an absolute dollar basis we don't expect our cable capital expenditures to be meaningfully different from 2019 levels. Similar to what I just said about our mobile capital expenditures, if we find new high ROI projects during the course of the year with that accelerated spend on existing projects to drive faster growth, we\u2019d still do so. ","The Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.6 billion consolidated free cash flow in this quarter and excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $1.9 billion of cable free cash flow, up $700 million versus last year's fourth quarter. ","For the full year 2019, we generated $5.8 billion of cable free cash flow, up $3 billion versus 2018, despite a cable working capital headwind of $800 million this past year. ","For the full year 2020, we would expect cable working capital to improve significantly with a neutral to slightly negative impact on our cash flow. We still have typical seasonal swings including the first quarter, in which our working capital is almost always a use of cash. With respect to mobile working capital, we continue to add mobile customers at an elevated pace, which will continue to drive handset related working capital needs in 2020. ","In any event our free cash flow profile improved significantly last year. We\u2019re positioned to continue to couple our free cash flow growth with our return focused investment and capital strategy.","We finished the year with $78.4 billion in debt principal and $74.9 billion in net debt. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4 billion. And as of the end of the fourth quarter, our net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 4.45 times at the high end of our 4 and 4.5 times leverage range. And while calculating our leverage, we include the upfront investment in mobile to be more conservative than looking at cable-only leverage, which was now 4.31 times at the end of the fourth quarter. ","During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $459 per share. For the full year 2019, we repurchased over $7.6 billion of our equity. And since September 2016, we've repurchased over $27 billion, or a bit more than 25% of Charter's equity at an average price of $346 per share. ","Turning to taxes, on Slide 2, our tax assets are primarily composed of our NOL and our tax receivables arrangement with Advance\/Newhouse, we now don't anticipate becoming a meaningful federal cash taxpayer until 2022 with some modest Federal cash tax payings beginning in late 2021, as we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of that year. ","For the years 2022 through 2024 we expect our Federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated EBITDA, plus our capital expenditures, and less our cash interest expense multiplied by 21% to 23%. That estimate would include part of our tax distributions to Advance\/Newhouse captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile but it's a good baseline for today.","So we're pleased with our results and we believe in our operating strategy, our network capabilities and the balance sheet strategy which all work in concert to create value over a long period of time. Charter has infrastructure assets with strong growth characteristics and cash flow yield. We have a lot of ancillary products to use for, and so on top of core connectivity services and combined with good value and service will drive cash flow growth with tax advantaged levered equity returns.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Chris, you gave a lot of good detail on some of the cost metrics, as we look out into 2020. And the 200 basis points you guys saw in cable margin improvement this quarter, especially with the advertising headwind I think was really the highlight. But putting it all together in terms of the programming and cost to serve continuing to come down, how should we think of cable margin trends heading into 2020?","Chris Winfrey","Sure. On one hand, you had a headwind, as you mentioned, political advertising not being in the fourth quarter of 2019. On the other hand, we had some fairly exceptional pieces that were taking place as well as the timing of our rate increases earlier inside of Q4 2019 than it has been in prior years. So I think that results in higher ARPU for customer relationship growth in what would be a sustainable either prior to that quarter or inside of 2020. So you need to take that into account. I think that growth rate given the subscriber mix could look a lot more like what we saw for the full year of 2019 and that with what we saw in Q4. ","The second thing I'd mention is that programming has done very well on a gross and per customer relationship basis. I think it'll still do well relative to other years. But at least like a mid-single-digit per customer relationship growth in programming cost in 2020. And then finally, as I mentioned, the cost to serve was exceptional in the fourth quarter. Our cost to serve for customer relationship has been declining. It's going to continue to decline is our expectation. But to have an actual gross decline, significant one inside the quarter was a big step down. And I just would encourage people to replicate that every single quarter. ","So then working against that, again, I am not giving guidance but ways to help you to build a model, particularly later in the year, we expect to see a pretty good year for political advertising. So all-in, I think it's going to move around and it's not something that we actively manage inside the business. What we\u2019re managing is can we grow our customer relationships faster? And that's our goal, which will then drive better revenue growth, continues to be our goal to grow faster. ","And it has been our experience and continues to be our goal to grow EBITDA at a faster rate than our revenue growth rate with or without a political advertising year. So that's I think the right way to think about that and not to get strategically hung-up in a particular quarter of year-over-year comparison on a margin rate to what\u2019s happening with the underlying trend. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Following up there, Chris, you talked about lower video gross ads year-over-year. Is that a result of fewer promotions and changed incentives? And you said the goal is to accelerate customer growth rate. How do you expect that to go from, in terms of gross ads and churn going forward? And then quickly a follow-up if I can on the in-sourcing program, you talked about it in your commentary. Where are we on the completion of that, and how much in terms of costs are still being duplicated as you in-source labor and everything else? ","Chris Winfrey","Sorry, Phil, what was your second question? So first one is lower video gross ads, third one is status of in-sourcing program, and any double -- or what was the second one? ","Philip Cusick","That was the gist of it?","Chris Winfrey","Alright, I thought there was a second. But anyway, lower video gross ads up -- I think it's more function of the marketplace more than anything else. We still believe in video as an our attractive piece to user connectivity package that we offer. It\u2019s an important attribute and it\u2019s investment in growth of the traditional setup box as well as all of our IP platforms. And I don't know if Tom wants to add any more on that.","Tom Rutledge","Well, yes. The lower gross ads I think are a function of the marketplace. It's not material to what drives our economic model, but it is a nice small addition to our broadband connectivity business.","Chris Winfrey","And then on the in-sourcing program, the in-sourcing is essentially complete. We have well over 90% of our service calls are handled in-house and onshore. And then in the field service side, you need to have some contract labor available for PC guys that were well over 75% of our labor in in-source there. And that's been the case for both of those for some time now. There's very little in the way to talk about costs anymore that's in the system. ","I do think that it's going to continue to get better for all the reasons that Tom mentioned. The tenure of our employees gets longer, which means they get more experienced and better and do higher quality transactions with our own employees who have a career path at Charter. The amount of self-installation is going up. The number of calls and truck rolls are going down. The churn is going down. And the amount of digital transactions as Tom talked about is also going up which means less labor intensive service infrastructure. And I think that the trend is going to be with us for a long period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. ","Brett Feldman","Tom, you just mentioned how video still can be very complementary to your core broadband product. There are a number of new direct-to-consumer video products coming soon, whether it's HBO Max or Peacock and those providers have all said they're looking for distribution, including through MVPDs. I was hoping you could give us your updated thoughts around being a partner for some or all of them. And maybe some of the factors that you have to think through as you decide whether it makes sense, whether it's the economics, if there is technical issues, or just some strategic considerations that are weighing on whether or not you're intending to do this? ","Tom Rutledge","Alright. Well, Brett, yes, there's an opportunity enough marketing direct-to-consumer products in our relationship with programmers and those relationships in many cases are also operating under the old model too, which is the bundled cable model. And we can hold both thoughts in our head at the same time. And so bundled products which I think will be selling for years to come, but also selling direct-to-consumer products and because of our customer relationship, because of the way we can package those products into our overall product mix, and the user interfaces that we developed with products like Flex are designed to help enhance. ","We have an opportunity to create and help programmers sell their content. And do that in a way that's mutually beneficial to both of us. And so we're working through those models with the various companies. We have already placed direct-to-consumer products like Netflix on our user interface and customers can purchase products directly from our user interface, other card product services, which we've been doing for a long time by the way. ","In many ways I look at these products like I look at pay TV. There are opportunities to enhance the video experience and part of the customer relationship. So we have ongoing discussions with all of the entities out there. And fundamentally, I think while there's a lot of dislocation going on in the video business, there's an opportunity in there for us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Two questions for either of you or both of you. Tom, any change in how you're thinking about pricing the video business in particular? I don't know if you would characterize your rate adjustments in the fourth quarter as a change from prior philosophy or not. But at least it seemed to us like a more aggressive increase in your video pricing than you've done in the past. I was wondering if that reflects a change in your mind about how you manage the business? ","And then Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks sort of mid-band Spectrum and any acquisition build out there. I was just curious where your guide collective head was at on that opportunity, if that\u2019s something that's becoming more likely, less likely or just how we should be thinking about that as we go through this year and think about some options coming down the road? ","Chris Winfrey","Ben, I think fundamentally, we didn't or haven\u2019t changed anything with regard to our pricing strategy, which is price isn\u2019t the major component of how we drive our revenue growth, it's subscriber growth and we have accelerating subscriber growth. And we expect to continue to have accelerating subscriber growth, because we have the price strategy, we do with the product strategy, we do. And the bulk of our revenue growth comes from that. ","So, we have been passing-through things like retransmission consent fees and other things in the video business and looking at the margins in the video business, and the competitive environment in the video business and how we're priced, but our fundamental strategy is not different. ","Ben Swinburne","And wireless?","Chris Winfrey","Mid-band spectrum? We're interested in mid-band spectrum, there's an auction coming up for CBRS. We're likely to participate in that auction. I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us. The SEC has been helpful in positioning that spectrum in a way that's an opportunity for us. And so we're carefully considering our auction there.","We'll be Ben disciplined as you'd expect about ROI for us to -- in spectrum that\u2019s required; costs, what are the costs to build and what\u2019s the financial return for doing so, and where would you do it. So, I think people should expect that we will be disciplined around that first what we think is pretty attractive and then clearly the more mobile lines that we have, the more attractive that ROI is. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","Two questions if I could. First on the wireless business, if I could just continue down that line of thinking. How much -- just given what you know today, how much traffic do you think you will eventually be able to offload with sort of thinking about as a percentage of total maybe, that you'd be able to offload under your own facilities if you think about where it might make sense to build where you have aerial infrastructure to be able to build? And is there any scenario where you would ever want to go to a full facilities based strategy where you would own your entire network? ","And then just back to the videos question for a second. How do you think differently about programming renewals just given the change in tone around your video strategy?","Tom Rutledge","So look on the wireless situation it's really a math question of what's a cost to pay for your MVNO rate and what's the cost to build, where's the traffic and what's -- how does all that work and that's the discipline that Chris was talking about. So, as we think about it, there's -- it depends on what you're paying for mobile traffic and what the economic traffic zone is in inside of a particular area and how you would switch that traffic. So I don't -- there's no immediate plan to change our fundamental relationship with our carriers. And -- but over time as the market evolves and speeds go up, and capacity goes up, the economics may change and we'll take advantage of those through time as the marketplace unfolds. ","With regard to programming, obviously, the biggest issue in the bundled package is price and a lot of people have been priced out of the market and we continue to negotiate contracts. And as penetrations in the overall distribution change, the relative value of the content changes and it changes the relationship and changes how much programming is worth to you as an operator. And so I don't expect the general circumstance of distribution could precipitously change over the next couple of years. I think we'll still have a big bundled product, but the relative pieces of that are changing in value and we will act appropriately in the marketplace. ","Chris Winfrey","Craig, you had a sub question on the wireless side that asked if there is any scenario where we want to evolve in the networking. And so far we haven't seen anything that really demonstrates that need. We have a very good partner Verizon. It's going to very well. And they have a very strong microCell powered network. And so I don't think that there's any economic case that we\u2019re seeing today that says we need to -- now we need partners within the interim partners for the years to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin ","Just following on the question around cost of service. I just want a clarification. You said we shouldn't impute the same improvement in cost of service that we saw year-over-year this year or we shouldn't assume the same cost of service. That is something that would drive cost of service from here assuming what kind of quarter you passed there. And then related to that, I'm wondering if you can give us an update on where the Legacy Time Warner churn is relative to Legacy Charter churn and whether Legacy Charter churn is finally bottomed down or there\u2019s still opportunities for that to come down? Because it seems like the churn improvement was a big component of the improvement in cost of service.","Tom Rutledge","So you little gobbled there, Jonathan. But on the cost to serve, the cost to serve trend has continued to go down on a per customer basis. There are all sorts of reasons, that's true. I think Chris is trying to say that what the pace that is and how that will manifest itself quarterly isn't something that you should straight line and extrapolate. But the fundamental part that we're on in terms of customer self-serving using high quality service operations with well skilled people doing the work is reducing overall transaction volume. And this is the digitization and the definition of the network-as-a-software defined network and many of the operations becoming software defined. All of those things are taking fundamental operating costs out of the business and capital expenditures that we made over the last three years as a result of the integration puts us in a position to realize that upside. So that's the fundamental notion that he was trying to express. And Legacy TWC churn continues to be both elevated relative to Legacy Charter, but continues to be declining at a faster rate than Legacy Charter continues to decline.","Jonathan Chaplin ","And it should be a gap now, it used to be ....","Tom Rutledge","Hey, Jonathan, you've got really bad cell signal and so this time around we couldn't hear anything on that question. ","Stefan Anninger","Thanks Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich ","I have a follow-up. So I think it was Tom who said that you will accelerate or you expect to accelerate customer growth rate this year. And I was just wondering, if you could elaborate on that? Do you mean high speed data only or are you including video in here? And then you also Tom mentioned, Flex and I don\u2019t know if it was just in the context of direct-to-consumer services, but do you have plans to offer a service similar to Comcast Flex and\/or can you talk about how you're thinking about the evolution of your broadband product that would differentiate -- make it more different besides speed, but that else is a differentiator?","Tom Rutledge","Well, when I spoke if accelerating growth, I was talking about high speed data and customer relationship growth accelerating. So that's what I meant by that. And in terms of Flex or similar products, yes, the answer is yes. There are a variety of IP relationships we have. We have one with Apple, selling IP devices through Apple. We have Roku devices that are product design. We've got millions of customers who subscribed to us directly through an app based product. And so our video product on the Internet or IP delivered cable TV and IP delivered over-the-top products are all being delivered through a variety of new technology platforms. Flex is one of those. And so the answer is, we're pursuing all the various opportunities in video that are available to us and including those in our broadband strategy. ","In addition to our -- we've enhanced our broadband through speed differentiation and taking our minimum speeds up. More than half of our customer base now gets a minimum speeds of 200 megabits as the slowest speed we saw. And we've enhanced that with our advanced Wi-Fi products, which deliver high quality service throughout the house, allow you to manage all the devices in your house, see what the service quality of those devices is and how they're connected to the network, as well as allow you to manage the privacy or the utilization of any of those devices throughout your house, so that you're secure, private and getting a high quality service everywhere inside your property and on the go. And so we continue to invest in the broadband platform to make it a better platform. And we continue to invest in legacy video and we continue to invest in the way legacy video transforms itself into a IP platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant With Evercore. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","James Ratcliffe","Hi, it's James Ratcliffe for Vijay. Two if I could. First of all Tom mentioned 10G is sort of the next phase and that with the 3.1 rollout done. Can you give us any idea of the timing or a magnitude of that sort of deployment? I assume it's differing in kind just degree to the $9 for home-pass so that 3.1 was? And secondly, in a slide you mentioned that the strategy in the business is not dependent on M&A. Can you talk about what you see the M&A landscape looking like both any opportunities for horizontal or if there are any incremental vertical acquisitions that would make sense? ","Tom Rutledge","Sure. So with regard to 10G, we just upgraded the whole network to 1 gigabit everywhere. That was the $450 million capital project I mentioned over a 13 month timeframe. 10G is a set of technology specifications that the industry has developed that allows us to ultimately get to 10 gig symmetrical services, which are provided at very low latency, delivery specifications and allows you to put high compute capabilities throughout your network. And there is no immediate need to deploy a new upgrade in the marketplace today, but it's an evolution that we can invest in as we go forward. And it allows us to do that incrementally in a very cost efficient way, a lot less cost than it would cost to build a brand new network. And so we have no immediate capital deployment associated with it. But it's a variety of tools to incrementally get you to at least a 10 gig symmetrical. And there's -- we have already surpassed that capability in our laboratory testing. And so that's just a stake in the ground in terms of what the potential of our existing infrastructure is. ","With regard to M&A, first of all, we don't have anything that we're about to talk about. But the cable business is owned by controlled shareholders mostly through the United States. And I think we have a great business and lots of opportunity, and with the right combination of assets there's always value in scale and market approach. And -- but there's nothing for us to say at the moment. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft","I wanted to ask you a couple questions on CapEx. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes in scalable infrastructure capital? It's down quite a bit in 2019 from the prior couple of years. Just wondering how we should think about that spending category in the coming years relative to history. Is there a sort of normal level if you will? ","And then secondly on CapEx. As you reach the end of the SEC commitment for new homes passed, what should we expect in terms of a normal homes passed growth rate? Will it kind of be the -- just the rate of home growth in your footprint? The way it's been maybe historically over the years or do you see opportunities now to extend the network to existing premises that are currently off-net? Thanks. ","Tom Rutledge","So with regard to scalable CapEx, Bryan, the -- we are getting advantages from the 3.1 deployment. And I think that those advantages, which are in with -- what the advantages is that the growth in Internet utilization on a per customer basis is a continuous investment required by us and the 3.1 so expanded the capacity of the plan that some of that scalable infrastructure capital that might have been in prior periods, isn't required right now. But that opportunity continues for a while yet, because once it's a function of the data usage per unit per customer.","And interestingly our Internet-only customers now are using over 500 gigabytes per month, half terabytes of data usage. So it is something that continues to climb. And that's relative to a wireless average customer of [8], to put that in proportion. But the capital expenditure, I think will stay in that space similar to what it is now for some period of time, clearly 2020, because of the capacity that\u2019s been built by 3.1 and the evolution of traditional video towards DOCSIS, any of that opportunity. ","Homes passed, look, we build everything that we can build from a homes passed perspective without regard to the requirements of our consent decree. So, we've accelerated and actually built more passings than the consent decree required, and there's nothing going forward that would change the rate at which we're building other than the rate of household formation. ","Chris Winfrey","And Bryan just on the CapEx, Tom mentioned we're temporarily depressed in 2019 and probably in 2020 for the continued DOCSIS 3.1 benefits. But if you think about the different line items for CapEx, our CPE which includes traditional installed, which is now our growing higher self installed, our CPE is declining and already the majority of that mix of CPE is more tied to Internet-related products as opposed to video products. ","As Tom mentioned, we've been building at an accelerated pace on the line extension. So I think that'll continue to be elevated with positive ROI attached to that build out. And the scalable while lower last year, probably this year as well, over time that's an area that we will continue to invest like we have in the past. And then in support, we continue to have not the same magnitude that we've had the past few years, but there's still a fair amount of integration -- [back into] the integration capital that's going on and you'll see that in the support category, whether that's through real estate or through IT systems. And so, whereas scalable may be temporarily lower, I think support is temporarily still higher. And that's the way the different pieces of CapEx will move over the short to medium term. ","Bryan Kraft","And on-balance, continued declines in capital intensity as you look beyond 2020 for the most part?","Tom Rutledge","We don't see anything that changes the arch that we're on. And mobile will have its own trajectory, which I talked about in the prepared remarks, which we expected to step down significantly in 2021 but for any ROI based investment in spectrum and\/or build out.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, Bryan. James we'll take our last question, please.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line and Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","I wanted to dig in more specifics on a couple of topics. Tom, I think to ask the question directly that I think folks were trying to, will you need to subsidize OTT video services to compete in broadband in the future against the likes of AT&T that's going to include HBO Max for certain customers. So, one, the competitive outlook going forward with broadband? Two, on the spectrum, it's super interesting that the conversations you've been having with us around wireless and the lack of the need for a physical network, I guess my question is, how much spectrum do you need because if you're just going after high capacity areas, I think you could do that with small amount of CBRS or CBM spectrum, 10 or 20 megahertz. But if you're going to build out 10 or 20 megahertz, you might as well build out more because the cost to build is sort of the same regardless of how many megahertz. So I'm just curious how you think about quantity of spectrum relative to that return on invested capital dynamic? Thank you. ","Tom Rutledge","Well, on the subsidization of OTT, that's really just price, what you're selling broadband for. And I think that we have a relatively good competitive posture from a price perspective in the marketplace. And so I don't see us changing that. But there we will do promotional offers that have a price effect in them, the cost in them. I won\u2019t say never, but it's just a marketing technique. It doesn't mean you have changed your fundamental pricing strategy. And with regard to wireless, you're into the math of what's the value of the physical network pieces and that's a function of a lot of things. It's not -- it is the cost of bills, the cost of what your rented network is and how those two things interact with each other. And so I'd say your thinking is correct, but we haven't decided exactly what we will do.","Doug Mitchelson","If I could just follow up on that, Tom. Do you need updated MVNO with Verizon or a new MVNO to take advantage of mid -- maximize taking advantage of building out an advanced spectrum in high traffic areas? Does there need to be any evolution in that relationship for you to be able to switch to your spectrum?","Tom Rutledge","We have a good relationship and we're happy with our MVNO relationship with Verizon. And I'm sure it will evolve through time. ","Stefan Anninger ","Thanks Doug. And thanks to everyone who listened to our call today. That concludes our call. ","Tom Rutledge ","Thank you very much.","Operator","And it does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation.

My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Charter Communications First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Stefan Anninger, you may begin.","Stefan Anninger","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Charter's 2013 First Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.","Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.","Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.","During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.","Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our Investor & News Center. The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Thanks, Stefan. I'm pleased with our first quarter 2013 results. They demonstrate that the strategy we have implemented over the last year is starting to have a positive impact. Our revenue growth accelerated during the first quarter to 5%, even without the benefit of last year's election year advertising revenue.","We grew residential customer relationships by 56,000 and our expanded basic video customers grew by 4,000 in the quarter, while our limited basic video product, which we no longer actively market, declined by 28,000.","Triple-play sell-in as a percentage of first quarter video sales was nearly 50% for the quarter. And as of today, it exceeds 50%. Triple-play customers continue to connect at an average entry ARPU of $120, a significant premium to our $90 promotional offer. 43% of our customer base is now on our new pricing and packaging structure, meaning that our customer base is increasingly receiving a better product with more value. We are now more competitive in the marketplace and can sell more products to our existing customers and to their neighbors. Our commercial segment again grew by approximately 20%.","Even with all the operating changes we've implemented and the investments we're making, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 2.8% in the quarter. We are essentially selling and providing a different service than we were a year ago, which is reflected in our revenue growth. Relative to last year's first quarter, we saw that triple-play sell-in rate improved by over 75%. We also achieved higher selling ARPU across the average package we sold in a higher product penetration per sale.","We did have lower gross sales compared to the first quarter last year, as we continue to rebuild our direct sales force and reorganize our inbound call center sales force in the first quarter. But generally, our sales channel performance improved steadily through the first quarter and has continued to do so. So sales are going up, and as Slide 3 of today's investor presentation highlights, we're offering a better product and service, which is more competitive than -- and which we expect to continue to drive deeper penetration in existing and new homes served, increase customer satisfaction and lower churn, a reduction in the amount of transactions with our customers, and as a result, realize a better return on the increased amount of capital we're investing.","Moving on to our priority in 2013. On our last quarterly call, I outlined our 4 key areas of focus for 2013. I believe we're performing well in each of these areas. Here's a brief update. First, we're actively leveraging our 2-way interactive high-capacity cable plant in order to extend the advantages we have relative to our competition. We continue to make network investments and perform deferred plant maintenance in order to deliver quality service. We also continue in our efforts on taking our plant all digital by the end of 2014. Going all digital allows us to offer more video content and higher data speeds through DOCSIS 3.0. We've started in Texas on a hub-by-hub basis, offering a substantial high-definition channel increase. Our plan is working, and we'll continue to roll that out across our entire footprint this year and next.","We've also recently received our cable card waiver from the FCC. The waiver is important is it will further reduce our advanced set-top box costs and enhance the return on investment associated with our all digital effort. The waiver furthers our goal to end up with a network and product infrastructure that allows boxes from multiple vendors and smart TVs to connect to our network with downloadable security software.","The second large objective in 2013 is to further develop our product and feature sets. We're making good progress on developing a cloud-based user interface and search service that will move key product and serve functionality out of the box, into the network and available across various devices and platforms.","Third, we continue to execute on our most important objective, improved operational performance to drive deeper penetration of our video, Internet and phone products across our 12 million passings.","That starts with providing an improved product and service to our 5 million current customers to generate more satisfaction revenue with lower churn. That deeper product penetration and customer satisfaction directly translates to higher success in selling products to the roughly 7 million passings which we have no relationship.","Finally, we'll continue to grow our commercial services business in the $9.5 billion telecom marketplace opportunity within our footprint by continuing to focus our sales and product development effort in this space.","So we're executing well on our plan, and I believe there are more good things to come for Charter.","Now I'll turn it over to Chris to give additional details on the first quarter.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, Tom. When we implemented our new product offering and operating strategies in the middle of 2012, we provided a general sequence of how we could see success develop in the metrics. First, through the quality of PSU growth, which we quickly saw through extended basic video and triple-play and from penetration growth.  Second, through residential customer ARPU and accelerating year-over-year revenue growth, which started in Q4 and continued into Q1 of this year. And ultimately, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, where we expect a meaningful first comparison once we have the full year of the same strategy and product offering in place.","As we look at Q1 2013 results, let me highlight what we're seeing within the metrics posted in today's materials. Starting with the customer trends on Slide 4. We lost 24,000 video customers in the quarter, down from a gain of 20,000 a year ago. If you exclude limited basic losses, we grew video customers by 4,000. And relative to the first quarter of 2012, we no longer actively market analog service or benefit from some of the aggressive packaging in place last year.","We added 99,000 Internet customers this quarter, less than the 141,000 gain a year ago that reflects our strategy of taking a more bundled approach and not having a $20 single play or $30 double-play offer in the market as we did for much of the first quarter last year. In fact, we have a higher quality product for the nearly 100,000 Internet net adds that we added at this quarter.","And as a result, we grew our phone customers by 59,000, a 28,000 increase versus the prior year, reflecting the higher sell-in of triple-play packages at the point of sale, which, as Tom mentioned, is nearly 50% of video sales in the first quarter.","You can see the early financial impact of the strategy most clearly in residential ARPU, which is now above $107 versus last year's $105 and overall revenue growth of 4.9%, which was increasing through the quarter.","Another way to express this is despite significant net adds in the first quarter of last year, in Q1 2012, we only grew residential revenue by 0.9% as compared to Q1 of 2011. In the first quarter of this year, we grew total residential revenue by 4.1%.","So looking at the detailed revenue line items on Slide 5. Our video revenue grew 6.8%, really driven by 4 factors: the quality of subscriber acquisition through higher sell-in of expanded basic versus limited basic. Our sell-in rate of expanded basic is now 99% versus 81% a year ago and our residential video base has grown to 90% expanded. We also have much higher level of box placement, SD, HD and DVR, all of which has revenue attached.","Thirdly, promotional rate step-ups partly offset by churn and rate increases, which really started in March. And finally, a higher amount of bundled sell-in, which results in allocating more revenue to video than in previous quarters.","Internet revenue grew 11%, driven by the addition of 250,000 Internet customers over the last year. And phone revenues declined 21%, with the increase in phone customers more than offset by revenue allocation out of this portion of the bundle.","Our commercial business grew by 19.6%, where we were a bit light on install revenue but continued the subscription revenue growth above 20% or 25%, excluding video.","If you look at commercial PSUs, we showed an increase of 6,000, which includes 10,000 commercial video losses in the quarter. As some of you may already know, EBU reporting reduces total reported bulk video customers with a basic cable rate increase, like the one we implemented in the first quarter rolls through our customer base.","So to be clear, our commercial video billing relationships grew in the first quarter and commercial video revenue also grew year-over-year. And total customer relationships for commercial would have grown by 8,000 excluding the EBU reporting effect.","Advertising sales fell by 9% in the quarter, driven by a decline in political and the eliminations of some barter contract revenue, which is offset in OpEx. Core advertising growth, excluding these impacts, was slightly positive in the quarter.","Slide 6 shows adjusted EBITDA rose 2.8% in the first quarter versus the prior year. We're pleased with this result given the amount of change still taking place in the business. And as a reminder, we're realigning our organization and restructuring field operations. We're migrating to more in-house versus outsourced labor. We revised our product and selling tactics and are redirecting various sales channels. We revamped our sales commission structure and we're catching up on deferred plant maintenance. So on the expense side, total operating expenses grew by 6.1% versus the prior year quarter.","The key items were programming cost, which was $24 million in the quarter. That equates to 4.9% on an absolute basis or 5.7% for expanded basic video customer. If you include the effect of higher limited basic losses and EBU accounting for commercial customers under our rate increase, the Q1 programming increase per total video customer was higher. We continue to expect full year 2013 programming expense growth in the mid to high single digits, particularly on an improved expanded basic customer basis, which is our focus.","Cost to service our customers increased by $36 million or 11%, reflecting higher spending on deferred plant maintenance and labor. This spending can have an outsized impact on reducing truck rolls, and we started to see early returns on these investments already.","Turning to Slide 7, our capital expenditures for the quarter were $412 million, reflecting a $72 million increase versus the first quarter of 2012. CPE spending increased by $61 million versus the prior year to support new customer acquisition, upgrades and the migration of existing customers to our new pricing and packaging.","Support capital increased $24 million year-over-year due to investments in our fleet, back-office systems and real estate. And commercial CapEx totaled $62 million, up $24 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily related to line extensions to support growth.","We continue to expect our total 2013 capital investments, excluding the impact of acquisitions, to be approximately $1.7 billion.","Before moving on to the balance sheet, I wanted to make a -- 2 below EBITDA items in this quarter's income statement. We have a $42 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the quarter related to early payments for our term loan C, which was held on the balance sheet at a discount due to fresh start accounting. The loss is a noncash charge.","On income tax expense, we typically run over $60 million per quarter in noncash deferred income tax expense as we have a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. In this quarter, the recent bond for bank refinancing lowered the noncash deferred income tax. We did not expect either of these noncash items to be recurring.","Moving on to Slide 8. We generated $118 million of free cash flow in the quarter, just above last year's first quarter level, driven by lower cash interest payments and higher adjusted EBITDA, offset by higher capital expenditures. We finished the first quarter with $865 million of total liquidity. And during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes due in both 2021 and 2023, most of which we used to pay down our term loan C.","Subsequent to the close of the first quarter, we priced a delayed draw 7-year term loan E in anticipation of the Bresnan closing. We amended and extended our term loan A. We amended, extended and upsized our revolver to $1.3 billion. We issued a new 7.5-year term loan F to refinance the term loan C and D, and we issued $1 billion in 10.5-year senior notes and tendered $900 million of 7 7\/8 notes with a cleanup call for the remainder.","So our debt maturity schedule pro forma for these transactions in the closing of Bresnan is shown on Slide 9. Over 95% of our debt now matures beyond 2016 and our pro forma interest cost will be 5.6% with an annual run rate expense of approximately $820 million.","As of March 31, our leverage was 4.8x. We still expect to close Bresnan in the third quarter. At which point, we expect to be levered at approximately 5x in the last 12-month basis.","As a reminder, our tax asset consisted of an outsized tax basis $8.9 billion and $7.7 billion of NOLs as of December 31, 2012. We announced last week that Liberty has completed its 27% investment in Charter. And as a result, we experienced a cumulative 50% ownership change from the past 3 years, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.","However, as today's 10-Q describes, we do not expect this ownership change to impact our ability to use our loss carryforwards in the future.","And on that note, we'll open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just wondering if I could ask a longer-term question because it's one that comes up with investors quite often. The way we're sort of modeling sort of the longer-term top line growth for your firm is to sort of use the sequential lift you saw in the Bresnan properties as a proxy, nominally 2% or 3%. The question I get most often from the buy side is they look at your sort of aggregate penetration rates and say, \"Gee, they're quite low relative to a lot of cable peers.\" Isn't the opportunity set much larger for you as you begin to turn Charter around? And I know it's a high-level question, but if you could just comment on that, that would be very helpful.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Jason, this is Tom. I don't want to give you a long-run forecast of what we think our revenue is potentially. But what you say is true, Charter's less penetrated than Bresnan is. And so from a potential point of view, it has more upside. Whether you can realize that or not, though, is the million dollar question. And the answer to that is there are logistical impediments to growth, and it's hard to grow faster than a certain rate growth, even regardless of what your base is. You see that in the commercial space if you look at how big it is relative to our penetration of it. It's growing rapidly, but it's hard to take that up by an order of magnitude. So I think that Charter has growth in front of it for years to come, whether we can logistically grow it faster than Optimum West or the Bresnan has grown, it's hard to say.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak of Pivotal.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Two for Tom. Could you give us your thoughts on having Liberty Media as your largest shareholder with board seats? And then do you otherwise have a more favorable attitude towards M&A, given their presence, your tax advantage position and the attractive debt markets? And I have one follow-up.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we are happy to have Liberty Media as a shareholder and as board members, as shareholders. I hope they're like any of our shareholders, and that they have expectations for the company's business plan, as we all do. And I think when you look at Charter's prospects, we do have a big runway in front of us. We are levered appropriately for the kinds of business we're in to get good returns from our growth. And we have a significant tax asset. And so, as investors, they're like all investors. I hope they understand our plan, and they do. As board members, they're experienced operators in this space, not only here but around the world. So they bring us a level of expertise that's really unmatched. And so we're pleased to have them. And in terms of our M&A approach, Charter doesn't need to do M&A to be successful, and we have an enormous opportunity in front of us and we're going to take advantage of that. If we can find other opportunities that are similar to Charter's opportunity and we can manage them and get them at an appropriate price, of course, we're interested. We just did the Optimum West acquisition for that reason, and we'll be opportunistic. But it doesn't really change our point of view.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Fair enough. And then Tom, can you talk about if you are seeing any substitution for OTT video providers? And I wanted to get your interest level of Aerial {ph] wins out in the courts and offering a low-end alternative to multichannel, say, an Aerial {ph] like service bundled with maybe a Netflix or an Amazon combined with your data offering.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. If you look at all the multichannel growth, there isn't much of it in the whole space, and I think -- and if you look at the population growth and household formation, it's shrinking, multichannel video penetration is shrinking, which you could argue is over the top. But I would argue that it's really more about pricing. We've gotten very expensive bundles of video packages in our product mix that we as distributors can't do much about at the moment, and which has gotten no relief from the FCC with retransmission consent. So it's a difficult consumer proposition, and the economy is still not great. We still have a lot of people unemployed and underemployed and the labor force participation is at historic lows. And so I think the big issue is price and economic, macroeconomic forces in general, that the value proposition or the desirability of the cable package or the multichannel video package that we sell is still really attractive to most people. So I think most people that are using over-the-top exclusively are doing it more out of economics than some value proposition in terms of what they really want to watch.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And would it be interesting to you to do an Aerial [ph} like service bundle with Netflix for those low-end subscribers that are economically challenged combined with your data offering?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, if Aerial [ph] prevails, it means that there's a way to put broadcast TV on televisions inexpensively in places where there's poor reception, and that's what cable was historically long ago. And so there's an opportunity there. Whether it can be exploited, whether it's legal are big questions. Would it dramatically change the business? I don't think it would. I do think that content would migrate away from broadcast and move into multichannel bundles. Most of the broadcast companies own other product that's cable exclusive or multichannel satellite and cable exclusive. So I really don't see it as a game changer, regardless of whether it's legal or not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik of UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick questions on CapEx. It looks like the increase we're seeing year-over-year is being driven largely by the CPE and the all-digital conversion. So Tom, could you just refresh our memories in terms of what you think is the sort of long-term capital intensity of the business, given Time Warner Cable and Comcast in the '13 to '14 range? And as you laid out the all-digital conversion in '13 and '14, can we assume that we can start to move towards that sort of longer-term level, as we move into 2015?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, we've said that we think that in the long run, the business becomes less capital intensive, and that last year was really the zenith of our capital spending as a percentage of EBITDA, of revenue. Same thing really.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Yes.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And that -- so going forward, that it will be less. And I think that's true, absent some change in the whole dynamic of the business or some acquisition. On a per sub or per dollar of revenue per sub basis, capital intensity should decline. And there are a bunch of forces that are loose that make that so. One, the network is completed. Charter's actually doing capital expenditures and operating expenditures on its network coming from what I called in the script deferred maintenance. What that means is that we've been walking out our plant and expensing that walk out and finding problems with the physical infrastructure and fixing them, which do -- some of which get capitalized. So you're spending capital and OpEx at a higher level that really reflect some years of neglect that happened as a result of restructuring of the company. But in general, the plant is in great shape and it's highly capable and fully functioning 2-way operator -- 2-way operating capable infrastructure. And so I don't see a continued significant investment in our network infrastructure. Going forward, though, CPE is getting less expensive on a per-box basis. Our waiver furthers that in the sense that each box that we're going to buy is going to cost less and each -- and the opportunity to stand up additional vendors and to hook to smart TVs directly all will reduce CPE intensity relative to the amount of TVs we have connected to our network. And we also have some additional capital cost that we've been incurring in the short run, as we restructure the company from a company that outsourced a lot of its labor to a company that's in-sourcing its labor. The reason we're having to spend capital is, even though we're pulling from the same labor pool for contractors and employees, we have to equip our own internal employees with new trucks, test equipment, et cetera. So we have 1.5 years now of spending or 1.25 years since I've been here that reflects that kind of change in the structure. At some point, we normalize that and we don't have any outsized spending relative to our labor force. In fact, the labor component of our total cash outlays become smaller, because we capitalize some of it. So the general answer to your question is -- and the direction of it is yes, we're moving toward more normalized ratio of capital to revenue over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a couple, but I do want to follow up on that. You said moving 2 more normalized ratio of CapEx to revenue. What will that more normalized ratio be? And then further, Tom, do you expect the cloud-based user-interface will have a impact on the business? Is that evolutionary or revolutionary?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, the answer to your first question is normal is a function of how fast you're growing, and we have ambitions to grow our business more rapidly as a result of this penetration position relative to the rest of the industry. So we shouldn't be seeking to have the same capital intensity as every other company. But at a general proposition, it's improving. The second part of your question.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Cloud interface...","Thomas M. Rutledge","The cloud interface revolution, evolution, what it does is allow us to have state-of-the-art user interfaces like our competitors that are over-the-top. And to put those interfaces on multiple devices, including the TV, and control the TV from those devices, so it allows you to search using a touch screen or a mouse and then to pull up content that you want to have and have that content appear on your big screen in a form of Video On Demand or a linear channel. And that is actually an improvement to the over-the-top products. And if you look at our actual content inventory, it's not much different than what the over-the-top providers are making. So in the sense of control and ease, it's a big differentiator to where we are using a remote control device on a grid guide on a TV. And -- but the beauty of it is that it allows all of our boxes that are already deployed regardless of their processing power and age to be capable of using the cloud-based infrastructure. And what it means is that the intelligence comes out of the box and moves into the network. And the client, so to speak, the set-top box can become a thinner client, which means again, less capital intensity on a set-top box basis and a better user experience and a reduction -- and it eliminates the need to replace your entire box inventory with higher processing power boxes, which could display graphical interfaces.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So we'll call it a revolutionary evolution, I think.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. I mean it's a significant opportunity and -- but the beauty of it is that it makes every box you have state of the art.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have one for Chris and one for Tom. Chris, on the quarter, last call, you were nice enough to tell us about your pricing plans for the year, and you talked, I believe, about at 2.3% lift to your revenue per customer kicking in, in the second quarter. But I don't know if the price moves you made came earlier than you had planned or anything you can help us to decompose the 2.2% increase year-over-year in ARPU or the $1.50 sequential, whatever you think is the right way to think about it.","Christopher L. Winfrey","So the rate increase, if you take a look at the different rate increases that we took against the product sets, it was 2.3% on 5 million customers for the full fiscal year of 2013. And we saw 1 month of that already inside of Q1, through different rate increases rolling through. So it really was at maximum 1\/3 of kind of your run rate effects. So that's the right way to think about it.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And that includes the price -- the promotional price? Obviously, you guys called that.","Christopher L. Winfrey","No, that's a separate and apart from promotional rate step-ups that take place upon customers rolling off their promotional offers.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I see. And then Tom, you guys had mentioned the CableCARD waiver a number of times over the last couple quarters. I know you haven't changed your CapEx outlook, but you seem to have called out the benefits of that. Could you maybe just spend a minute on why that's important and how that changes the speed and capital cost of the all-digital rollout?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. So the reason we haven't changed our capital guidance is we assume we would get it, and we thought we can manage through it, even if we didn't -- at least in this fiscal year. But the -- in the long run, what it allows us to do is to buy less expensive boxes. And the simplest part of the equation is that right now, we have to buy a box that has a form factor in it that allows the insertion of the CableCARD and we have to buy a separate CableCARD. And that physical infrastructure in the box costs money, and it's significant on a per box basis. And we get that savings right away. In addition to that, the downloadable security infrastructure that we're going to stand up will allow us to hook TVs directly or devices, DVRs, any device, any CE device with the chipset in it, will be able to be activated with downloadable security by the cable company, by us. That means that not every device we have will require us having any CPE at all in the house. And as more smart TVs proliferate, you're moving to a world where a lot of CE devices that act as televisions or PCs will be able to be connected on a cable-ready basis, so to speak, no capital involved on the part of the cable company. And finally, there's been a duopoly of security, conditional access, we call it, between Cisco and Motorola, and it'll be opened. I think both of those companies recognize that, and that makes other vendors easier to sell products into this industry, which will mean that any CPE devices that are needed between the cable company and another device, like a TV, will be less expensive if there's a more competitive environment.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One quick one and a little bit longer. So can you, number one, define for us what the single-play limited video is as a percentage of the base? And do you see a point where churn driven sort of basic video decline start to moderate? And then second, can you detail more for us the differentiated offer you started in additional markets in Texas? And is that leading to any acceleration in uptick?","Thomas M. Rutledge","I'll take the -- I can do -- do you want to do the first 2?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So that -- look, Phil, the simple answer is that we have 90% of our video base now expanded basic. So that by default means that you have 10%, which is the limited basic. We've provided you the single-play penetration percent, which inside of Q1 is now 37.7%. And what we've not done for a whole host of reasons is to provide single-play Internet versus single-play video. So -- but I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of the limited basic customers in that 10% of our video, the vast majority are traditionally single play, but there are some in there that were coming through as a result of low-end triple play offers that the company had made in the past, which then rolled off into promotions inside of Q1, and that's part of the reason you see higher churn on that base as well. So I think the amount of the drop-off that we've seen in the past couple of quarters is a function of that. So maybe some would accelerate it as to where, as Tom call it, your status [ph] becomes over time. The other piece that takes place is that you naturally are migrating that customer base into new pricing and packaging into a more full video product. So it's not just churn. It's also migration into the proper video product. And then you're selling, as you replace churn over time, you're selling at a 99% sell-in of extended video. So I think we've seen an accelerated amount of reduction in that limited base through all of those, but particularly given the roll-off to promotion that we were selling at this time last year. And as we get into a proper year-over-year comparison, we expect that base to continue to decline but maybe not quite as rapid of a rate.","Thomas M. Rutledge","And in your Texas question, we're going from a situation where we had a lot of analog television still on our network there, and we're turning it off completely and launching, I believe, 140 channels of HD approximately, simultaneously with the reduction in -- we're turning off of the analog product. Most of the way we market our way in with a fairly high digital penetration. And we're finding that, that, combined with the offers we have in the market there and the focus we have on it, our sale on a year-over-year basis are accelerating. I mean, essentially, we have better products there now, significantly better product than we had historically. And so it's early and -- but we're pleased with the results we see so far.","Operator","You have a question from the line of Vijay Jayant of ISI Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is David Joyce for Vijay. With some of your peers having a significant triple-play promotions over the course of past year that are in some instances, turning into increase churn, we were wondering how that situation might play out for you, given that you've got lower penetration. Wondering if you might not have the same experience, if you could talk to that please.","Thomas M. Rutledge","Our goal is to reduce churn through our strategy, and that's our expectation. And the reason we think it will work for us is because we're putting a more valuable product in the home than customers have historically had. It's all digital. It's 2-way. It's lots of high definition TV, linear and On Demand. It's very fast Internet service, 30 megabits at the slowest speed that we saw incrementally and a very feature-rich phone product. And when -- and it's value priced, and it's value priced if you keep it together as a service offering in the future. And we believe that, that product is valuable, that consumers recognize it and it can't be replicated by our competitors easily. It's superior to satellite in that it's a 2-way interactive product. It's faster than DSL, and the phone service is more fully featured and less expensive than you can buy from an incumbent phone company. And packaged, it's a better economic value than you can buy the component pieces from individual companies. So if you look at our satellite competitors and look at their ARPU, and you look at what the full package that we sell is and its value proposition, there's a significant opportunity for us to grow and to retain the customers that we connect. So we don't expect it to increase churn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack of Nomura.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit about the -- you talked about the economy and sort of price sensitivity and the over-the-top discussion. How's that impacting customers' interest or appetite for moving up the speed tiers? And also as you think about the price increase you just instituted, will that also have a negative impact based upon people, obviously, looking for cheaper products out there?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, the answer to that is yes. We took a modest price increase on the products, 2.3% across our customer base, and we were conservative with it for that reason. Even though our costs for programming are rising more rapidly than that. And we think that our product -- if you look at what people are subscribing to already and our relative market share of that, that we can stand up a better product than our competitors, and that better product can be more -- can be priced from a value proposition in a better way and that we can take share. That's our business proposition. But if we had a growing economy and we have people going back to work, the opportunities for growth will be greater.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Tom, just to circle back on the M&A discussion, what do you think about potential acquisitions out there? Is contiguousness or demographics important to you thinking about urban versus rural assets?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Well, no, I guess is a simple answer. I think, any -- at some level, if the asset is small enough, the demographics matter. But any cable operation of size that covers a significant part of the country will tend to have average demographics. And I think that average demographics create an opportunity for a well-run cable system.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shing Yin of Guggenheim.","Shing Yin - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a follow-up to an earlier question about the limited basic subs and a kind of related question. So on the limited basic subs, you said you lost 28,000 in the quarter. I just wanted to clarify whether that is a net number, that is net of any that you may have recaptured or upgraded to an expanded video product. And if so, can you give us an idea what your recapture rate was in the quarter and has typically been over the last several quarters?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Ours -- so let me answer that one first before you go on to the second question. So it is a net number. It's a net loss number. And the way to think about what we offset is that we sold 99% expanded inside the quarter, which meant that we were permitting 1% sell-in of the limited basic relative to that being a substantially higher number last year. So the goal was to sell expanded basic. And so the vast majority of gross disconnects were not offset by new connects into limited basic.","Shing Yin - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I see, that's helpful. And my second question was from the trending schedule, your percentage of customers who are non-video increased to 22% in the quarter from 17% a year ago. I just wondered if you can give us an idea whether that reflects a larger number of customers within your markets who maybe are not choosing to take video at all? Or are you actually seeing more customers take your Internet product but choose video from another provider? And if so, who are you primarily losing these video subscribers to?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes. I'm not sure that I would argue that we're losing video subs to someone else as a result of the Internet sales. I think we're replacing DSL in satellite homes with Internet-only customers is my view of what the primary driver of that is.","Shing Yin - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so does that suggest that when they switch over to your Internet product, they are actually keeping their -- whatever video service they previously had?","Thomas M. Rutledge","Yes, yes. And our goal, obviously, is to improve our video product and our brand and our reputation in the video space so that we can improve that conversion. But we have a highly valued, highly well-branded, recognized data product, and it's having significant successful traction in the marketplace. Our video product is rapidly improving but it doesn't have those attributes yet in the minds, eye of the consumer. And so there's more work on video, but I think we can get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one question to clarify another question. The $107 for customer relationships, just to clarify, does that include commercial customers or not? And then looking at your NOLs, what's your current expectation for the percentage of your share base that going towards the change of control post the Liberty acquisition? How close are you to possibly tripping that? And what agreements do you have with 5% holders to avoid jeopardizing the tax asset?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Sure. So on the first one, it's residential revenue per residential relationships. So it's a clean number. And on the second question, we did push through the 50% cumulative 3-year change in ownership. And despite that, we do not believe that the value of our tax assets is impaired. There's a fairly good disclosure inside of the Q as to why that's the case. It's a function of both the price at which that transaction closed, as well as additional realized built-in gains. But net-net, we don't believe that we're at all impaired to convert  related [ph] to use those tax assets.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza of CRT Capital Group.","Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","This is Shagun for Lance. So all the investments made in network sales, marketing and promotion were made last summer. That -- would that make 1Q the trough in terms of EBITDA margin compression? Or should we expect at least some margin compression in 2Q as well and then for it to ease in the back half?","Christopher L. Winfrey","So the -- I think the fact is we're not going to be giving lots of EBITDA margin guidance. But if I just trace you back through the changes that we made, the changes that we made were really started in Q3. They include both the way that we went to market product, pricing, packaging as well as the accelerated preventative maintenance and continue starting to do some of that deferred plant maintenance that Tom was talking about, and that really accelerated through the fourth quarter last year that's continuing today. And so I don't think that if you try to take a look at the business the way it's being operated and what we're selling and the customer base that we have, you're not going to begin to have a really clear year-over-year look until you can at least get into Q3. And even then, you're going to have a mixed customer base that is a function of both legacy as well as new pricing and packaging customers. Today we're at 43%. That is not an inconsequential number. So 43% of our base is now in that new pricing and packaging. And the higher we can get that number over time, the more like-for-like it becomes as well as our operating practice on a year-over-year basis. So I think you need to think about all those things when you think about the investments going in both in P&L as well as capital expenditures.","Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then one question regarding CapEx. 1Q CapEx was actually slightly below what we were expecting, although we are expecting it to be down on a full year basis. I was just wondering if any capital expenditures will push from 1Q into 2Q. Or is this really the run rate we should be expecting going forward?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Look, I don't know your model, so I'm not going to try to comment on it, but we spent $412 million of capital expenditures inside of Q1. Our estimate still is $1.7 billion for the full year. It's a function of growth, it's a function of scalable, it's a function of commercial. There's a lot of moving parts inside there. So I'd rather not go much further beyond that than what we've already talked about.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Amy Yong of Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Two quick questions. Can you talk about the video revenue growth of 6.8% in the quarter and kind of parse out what drove the growth mix, revenue allocation and price increase and how we should think about the rate of growth over the next few quarters? And then just quickly on Bresnan, can you help us think through some of the synergies that we should be thinking about?","Christopher L. Winfrey","Sure. So on video revenue, I gave a fair amount of color from the prepared remarks, as well as the -- as well as what we'll see in the release and the 10-Q today, so I don't want to be overly repetitive. But we're selling different products, so you're getting more revenue at acquisition. We're putting more boxes onto these homes, both from new customers as well as they migrate. We also have been more rate disciplined at promotional rate step-up. We took some rate increases. And then finally, I gave a sense that there is -- as we sell in and migrate customers to new pricing and packaging, there's effectively a reallocation on the bill that's taking place on bundled customers out of phone, and that's by design and a little bit into the Internet and video. So all those things put together, I'm not going to provide a waterfall because it's extremely complex. We had to take a look at acquisition, which package and is it single, double triple play and migrations or not. So it would be inappropriate to do that, but that's the right context to think about it. In Bresnan, we'll handle that very appropriately. We've not disclosed anything about integration that we expect to have synergies. I think the reality is it's operated in a way that Charter's operating its plant today and it's going to market the same way that we do. And so we think it's going to fit very well, so it's less about trying to drive the cost synergies and more about trying to grow the business and grow penetration and grow the amount of ARPU per relationship and the amount of cash flow per home passed by [ph], doing both on the revenue side, as well as lower transaction cost and improving the capital efficiency along the way.","Thomas M. Rutledge","But I think the one thing I would add about Bresnan is that it's already more capital efficient than Charter because capital is spent to get that plant ready to be marketed like we're currently marketing Charter.","Thank you all.","Christopher L. Winfrey","Thanks, everyone.","Robin Gutzler","Thank you, operator.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
