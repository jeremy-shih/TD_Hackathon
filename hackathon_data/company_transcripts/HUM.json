I will now hand today's call over to Regina Nethery. Please go ahead.","Regina Nethery","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Humana's senior management team will discuss our first quarter results and our updated earnings outlook for 2014. Participating in today's prepared remarks will be Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve McCulley, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Joining Bruce and Steve for the Q&A session will be Jim Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.","This call is also being simulcast via the Internet along with a virtual slide presentation. For those of you who have company firewall issues and cannot access the live presentation, an Adobe version of the slides has been posted to the Investor Relations section of Humana's website.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website.","Finally, any references made to earnings per share, or EPS, in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $2.35, with solid performance in our Medicare Advantage, commercial group and government business. These results are indicative of the power of our Integrated Care Delivery strategy, clinical excellence through coordinated care.","Medicare beneficiaries are benefiting from the progress in our clinical programs through benefit stability and plans with increasing higher-quality ratings, all in a rate reduction environment. Individual Medicare Advantage growth during the recent enrollment season was particularly strong, with membership up 13% from the end of last year, as we are able to offer reasonably stable levels of member premiums and benefits.","Though some investors have expressed concern over this level of growth, we believe our ability to enroll our members into clinical programs in a timely manner helps ensure we are assisting members with their health needs. We've been closely monitoring admissions, program participation and pharmacy experience for our new members. And to this point, we are very pleased and satisfied across our Medicare Advantage business as a whole and for our Florida regional PPO.","Our integrated delivery model is differentiating Humana by putting customers first with a goal of making it easy for them to achieve their best health. A key element of this is creating a trusting and engaging relationship with beneficiaries we serve as quickly as we can.","In the first quarter of 2014, we completed health risk assessments for approximately 531,000 of our Medicare members and nearly 8,000 individual commercial members. Further, our sophisticated predictive models have identified approximately 100,000 of our members as potential candidates for the Humana Care Chronic Program or our Personal Nurse Program. All of this has helped to drive a 31% year-over-year increase in new members in our Humana Chronic Care Program. This program is one of our strongest examples of clinical excellence through care coordination. Our strategy also continues to enable us to partially offset the negative impact to our members from the ongoing Medicare rate cuts from CMS.","Turning then to the Medicare rates for 2015. We had initially estimated the impact of the final rate notice issued in early April to be a funding decline of 3%. After further analysis, we now anticipate funding to be down approximately 2%. Regardless, it's still a funding cut in an environment of increasing medical cost.","As always, our Medicare bids, product pricing and benefit design are currently being developed with the goal of achieving our target margin of approximately 5% in the aggregate for all our Medicare products, while minimizing disruption for Medicare beneficiaries. We anticipate sharing more detail around this later in the year after our bids are filed and approved by CMS. But at this point, we do expect the products we offer in 2015 will continue to integrate clinical excellence through coordinated care. Thus, enhancing the consumer experience while promoting wellness.","Our focus on enhancing the coordination of our clinical processes continues to provide solid returns on investments we've made. We now expect to increase those investments by another $100 million to $150 million during 2014, helping position Humana for expanding growth opportunities in a challenging funding environment. This additional investment has been incorporated in the reaffirmation of our guidance we shared with you this morning and generally represents the scaling of the clinical capabilities we've discussed in the past.","Our Part D offerings are facing a challenge this year from the cost of specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C. Although we had anticipated some level of hepatitis C spend in the year, due to a faster approval process and accelerated level of awareness, the impact of these drugs has come sooner and is more significant than we planned.","In the first quarter of 2014, we incurred approximately $20 million of expense related to these specialty drugs, net of risk share with CMS.","The vast majority of this was for our Medicare Advantage and PDP membership. We believe health plans across the sector will be taking higher hepatitis C specialty drug costs into account for 2015 product pricing.","We are also watching closely the potential roll-out of similar drugs later this year, since we expect that could result in another wave of utilization. Our current forecast for 2014 anticipates specialty drug costs will stay at an accelerated level throughout the year.","Turning now to health-care exchanges. Since we spoke to you last quarter, we are pleased to experience a growing number of applications, which has led us to raise our HumanaOne growth expectations to a range of 350,000 to 500,000 in 2014. A large portion of this raise expectation took place as the open enrollment period was coming to an end. This higher projected membership is allowing us to lower our estimated health care exchange investment spending as we leverage our operating platform across a bigger base. Steve will elaborate on this further in his comments.","With the open enrollment period now complete, we can begin to evaluate how certain our original pricing assumptions are playing out, recognizing that it is still very early and our claims experience for this population has yet to develop fully. The mix of our on-exchange enrollment appears to validate our original pricing assumptions and, as we anticipate and price for, it's skewed slightly to a younger population than the industry as a whole.","Our pricing assumptions around our original expected growth and the participation of previously underwritten individuals have been negatively impacted by a number of factors, including the administration's transitional policy changes.","We are in the process of evaluating early pharmacy claims and other forms of medical data to evaluate the overall health conditions of our new-member base. Our original -- although our original pricing assumptions were negatively impacted by the factors I've just discussed, we continue to believe the overall health condition of our health care exchange membership approximates our estimate from 90 days ago.","We remain cautious not to get ahead of ourselves in our interpretation of this data and are continuing to watch medical claims development for this population but are not seeing any deterioration from our expectations over the past 90 days.","So in summary, we believe that our integrated care delivery strategy is continuing to position us for success. We are growing membership across a number of fronts without compromising on pricing discipline. The roll-out of our state-based contracts is moving along well, and we continue to evaluate ways to apply our clinical model to this expanding book of business. While it is still early in the year, we are encouraged by the indicators we continue to monitor and feel confident in our ability to achieve earnings per share in the range of $7.25 to $7.75 for 2014.","Before I close, I want to also spend a moment on our recent CFO announcement. Let me begin by thanking Steve McCulley for his diligence and dedication while acting as interim CFO. Steve has a strong command of our operations and breadth of accounting expertise. I look forward to continuing to have Steve as part of the management team that sets strategic direction for the company in his role as Principal Accounting Officer. Brian Kane will be joining us as CFO June 1, and brings financial and strategic breadth to the role that will nicely complement Steve's operational depth. I look forward to having Brian join our leadership team.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a review of our financials.","Steven E. McCulley","Thanks, Bruce. Looking briefly at our first quarter results, we are pleased to report earnings per share of $2.35 that reflected solid results in our Medicare Advantage, commercial group and government businesses. These results reflect, in large part, the impact of strong membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business, as well as favorable utilization trends and favorable prior-period development in both our Medicare Advantage and Commercial group businesses, which contributed to the improved benefit ratios in both our Retail and Employer Group segments. Additionally, we have increased our outlook for membership growth for our Medicare Advantage, PDP and individual exchange businesses, as noted in this morning's press release.","With respect to pre-tax results, our Healthcare Services segment reported a meaningful increase in pre-tax income over last year's first quarter, due to a higher contribution from the Pharmacy Solutions and home-based services businesses, which serve our growing Medicare Advantage membership.","Our Employer Group segment also increased its pre-tax income relative to last year, reflecting a lower benefit ratio that was partially offset by a somewhat higher operating cost ratio, which now includes the taxes and fees associated with the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, including the health insurer fee.","These improvements in Healthcare Services and Employer Group segment pre-tax income were offset by a decline in retail segment pre-tax income year-over-year, as utilization levels were more than offset -- as lower utilization levels were more than offset by planned investment spending associated with our state-based contracts expansion and the exchanges, as well as the negative impact of higher-than-expected drug costs in our Part D benefits. These higher drug costs were driven primarily by hepatitis C treatments, which are expected to continue through the remainder of the year.","Despite these higher drug costs and the impact of the new health-care exchange membership, our Retail Segment benefit ratio still improved by 60 basis points compared to prior year, driven by better-than-expected utilization in our Medicare Advantage business during the quarter. You may also recall that prior year pre-tax results in our Medicare business also had benefited from the absence of the impact of sequestration, which was implemented effective April 1 last year. The year-over-year increase in the retail segment operating cost ratio reflected investments in our state-based contracts and exchanges, along with the ACA taxes and fees, including the health-insurer fee.","So to summarize the first quarter, we are again pleased with the improving utilization in our Medicare Advantage business and the strong underlying performance of our other businesses, and believe that our continued progress positions us well as we move through 2014 and beyond.","Turning to the next slide. This chart details the items that impacted our updated outlook, starting at the left of the slide. We now see 4 primary items impacting our initial guidance for EPS of $7.25 to $7.75 per share, which included planned investment spending of $0.50 to $0.90 per share in our state-based contracts expansion in the individual exchanges.","First, given strong performance of our underlying core businesses, we now expect to recognize $0.70 to $0.85 per share of net operational improvements for the full year that we had not expected in our previous guidance. This range includes improvements in medical trends and utilization in our Medicare Advantage business, along with cost savings from our ongoing productivity efforts.","We believe that our improving Medicare Advantage medical trend continues to demonstrate the value of our clinical model in creating a long-term value in a challenging business environment.","Second, based on drug cost trends we are seeing, primarily around hepatitis C drug costs, an expectation for progression of these treatments among our member population, we expect to recognize $0.40 to $0.50 of net incremental expense from our previous guidance related to hepatitis C for the full year. As you would expect, we are actively managing our approach to treatment of this disease and will continue to respond appropriately to developments as clinical protocols continue to evolve and as further treatment options come to the market.","Third, our outlook around the health-care exchanges has improved, and we now expect to recognize $0.10 to $0.15 per share of improvement relative to the original estimate of $0.50 to $0.90 of investment spending for our state-based contracts expansion and individual exchange businesses. This brings our current expectation for spending in these areas to $0.40 to $0.75 per share. This improved outlook reflects the benefits of our increased membership and revenue outlook for the individual exchanges, which leverages our operating platform.","Finally, as Bruce discussed, given the ongoing and demonstrated success of our clinical model, we are investing an additional $0.40 to $0.50 per share for incremental clinical investments, which will better position us for the 2015 rate cuts. So taken together, these items leave our overall earnings guidance unchanged in the $7.25 to $7.75 per share range, which, as I discussed, includes less investment spending for our individual exchange business due to improving scale and incremental clinical investments. As we've discussed before, we expect all of our investments to position us competitively and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects.","And as usual, this range allows for some level of variability in our planned investment spending and any normal fluctuation that may occur in our core businesses. We look forward to updating you when we report our second quarter results in late July.","Turning next to cash flow. We produced strong operating cash flow for the quarter of $671 million, which compares to $412 million last year. As we discussed last quarter, the effect of the 3Rs will impact the timing of our operating cash flows for the full year. At the end of March, we had established a receivable of $54 million related to the 3Rs. And by year-end, we now expect to build a total receivable of $575 million to $775 million that will be collected in 2015, the majority of which is expected to be driven by the reinsurance provisions of the ACA. This range is higher than our previous expectations, due primarily to higher exchange enrollment. We have accordingly revised our 2014 operating cash flow guidance to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion to reflect this updated expectation.","As I mentioned in our last earnings call, receivables or payables associated with the 3Rs should not have a significant impact on subsidiary surplus or subsidiary dividend capacity.","As usual at this time of year, we have submitted our request to the state department of insurance that regulate our various insurance companies and have requested a total of approximately 930 million of subsidiary dividends. As you may be aware, the approval process for dividends is subject to additional uncertainties this year due to the treatment of the ACA's industry fee by the departments of insurance. Accordingly, we don't expect to have approval of all of our dividend requests until later this month, after we have filed our first quarter statutory financial statements. Today, we have received approval for over 40% of our total requests. As always, we will keep you apprised when our dividend requests are approved and finalized.","Finally, as announced in our separate press release last week, the Board of Directors has increased our quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share. Additionally, as announced today, the Board has also refreshed our $1 billion share repurchase program through June 30, 2016. Consistent with the previous authorization, the refreshed repurchase authorization permits shares to be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchase or in privately negotiated transactions.","So with that, we will open up the lines for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It looks to me like you're projecting that you're going to get much -- a much greater portion of your earnings this year in the first quarter than you normally do. So does that -- why are we seeing such a different seasonal pattern for you this year? If -- Part D was bigger, so that should've depressed your Q1. And instead, you had very strong Q1 earnings. Sequestration should have depressed your Q1 earnings relative to the rest of the year, year-over-year. So can you tell us sort of why you're seeing this different seasonal pattern than you had in the past?","Steven E. McCulley","Sure, Peter. This is Steve. I think -- first, I think if you took -- if you looked at last year and you adjusted for the long-term care charge in the fourth quarter, we earned around a little over 30% of our earnings in the first quarter. And I think if you take this year and you do the same math, you get to a comparable number. But still, you're -- I think the difference is -- what I would also throw in there is that the hepatitis C impact is largely in front of us in the remainder of the year. So a lot of that lies ahead. So that'll put some pressure on the remainder of the year relative to the rest, as long -- as well as the duals in the investment and the duals that also continues to run between now and the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to go into the 3R number that you booked here. It just seems like a large number. Am I thinking about it right if I say that at $675 million, it's half of your retail operating income? Is there -- that number just seems large. Can you put that into context for me? And I know that, I think, last quarter you said the same thing that the majority of it is related to reinsurance. But at least from that answer last year, if felt like it was more like 60% than 90%. Any sense of -- or better clarity you can give us about how much is actually reinsurance versus risk corridors?","Steven E. McCulley","Sure. Thanks, Kevin. This is Steve. The -- it is mostly reinsurance. So more than half is the reinsurance. And that's going to move up just with volumes. So -- as we've added a lot -- as we've increased our membership estimates, that number has moved up commensurate with that. And that shouldn't -- the thing about the reinsurance number is that, that number gets larger as we go through the year. It's not -- it'll accumulate. So -- but I wouldn't expect us to be a lot different on a per member basis around the reinsurance than the other carriers. Maybe the risk selection affects that to a degree. But we're just -- we're trying to give as much disclosure as we can around what we see. And, again, I think it's mainly reinsurance driven. So I would just leave it at that.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But I guess, I mean, just the size of it is surprising to me in the context of the Retail business. Wasn't sure if you could -- is that the right way to think about it? And I guess, then -- the implication would be, well, how do you reprice that business over time as the reinsurance numbers and coverage comes down over the next couple of years? Does that imply a big raise in pricing?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, to Steve's point. It's really a math exercise. We've looked at other of our commercial blocks of business, and we've seen that level of claims experience above the reinsurance attachment point, and we've applied that here. We are pricing for 2015 for the wear off of the reinsurance benefit that winds down over a period of time. So inherent in our 2015 pricing is the fact that, that reinsurance number is going to go down over time. So when we talk about our pricing for '15, we can see pricing levels anywhere in the single digits to the double digits. And a big part of that double-digit drive is a result of the reinsurance wear-off.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question relates to the Medicare Advantage growth. It seems like you guys have gotten a little more comfort on the medical cost trends are coming in a little bit favorable this year. We now know the final rates for 2015, your bonus stars, et cetera, so I guess, obviously, the missing piece is the competition and what others do. But I'm just curious if you can give us sort of preliminary thoughts on '15 in terms of membership growth. Should we be thinking about something similar to what you've been able to show? Or is there a cumulative impact to some of the benefit changes that you have to make and we should start expecting a slowdown in membership?","Bruce D. Broussard","We're just in the midst of our bid process here in estimating 2015 rates. And I think it would be premature to talk about our membership growth for '15, Josh.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So maybe, Bruce, let me ask it a different way then. Longer-term, forgetting just specifically the next year, but as you think about the benefit design changes that you have to make relative to this underfunding that you've mentioned several times, do you still think that Medicare Advantage growth rates should be significantly above population growth in the Medicare book? It's, say, 3% over the next couple of years. As you think about the next 5 or 10 years, do you think that, that -- your membership growth will continue to outpace that overall market growth?","Bruce D. Broussard","We've said in the past that we do believe that Medicare Advantage, for a host of reasons, will continue to grow faster than the population. We see penetration historically growing even in times of rate reductions from CMS. And I think it's evidence of the population preferences and how they have changed over time. And then, secondarily, I think Medicare Advantage, because of the improved quality, the clinical programs and the integrated delivery model, offers a much better value than fee-for-service. So we do see it growing greater than that. I think year-to-year changes in market share and where we grow or our competitors grow faster, is really, I think, a result of clinical programs. And as I've said on many occasions, the differentiation in the marketplace is who's got the best clinical programs and can offer and really improve the experience in the clinical aspects of the member. And we're biased, and we think Humana today is the leader in that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Andrew T. Tom - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Andrew Tom in for Justin. Can you give us a breakdown of the $100 million to $150 million of incremental clinical investments and where that spend is going specifically?","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray. Obviously, we grew fairly significantly. So we're going to hire a bunch of clinicians in a lot of the programs that have been beneficial for us. The one program that we talk quite a bit about is in the home-care services, where we put nurses in front of seniors who need our support services to maintain themselves in their home. And that's been a very effective program for the seniors to maintain themselves in their home environment, as well as for us, because what we're doing is deferring or eliminating an ultimate hospitalization or a nursing home space. So that's a big area of focus. Other things we're focused on doing are looking at some remote monitoring kinds of tools and techniques to help us with those kinds of chronic programs. We're also looking at the engagement levels of some of the individuals who participate in our programs. And we're working with the folks in our Centers of Excellence to try to develop ways to get more people to participate. And so we'll spend some money in that regard. Really, again, focused primarily on hiring clinicians in a lot of areas that are around our integrated model and having us focus on root cause as opposed to the ultimate event around a hospitalization or a nursing home business and shifting the way that we think as an organization. And I think that's been paying some dividends. And when we get the opportunity to invest in those kinds of things, we're going to take it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Going back to the 3Rs, I know you said that more than half is the reinsurance piece. But I was hoping you can give us how much of the receivable relates to the -- your estimate of the risk corridor. And are you concerned at all with sort of the budget neutrality aspect and actually getting paid for that piece?","Steven E. McCulley","Thanks. This is Steve. Probably the smallest amount will be the risk corridor in the full year that we look -- as we look at the full year. In the quarter, we recorded $54 million for the 3, and about $13 million of that was risk corridor. We don't -- with the budget neutrality, there's -- we don't see any problem with that, certainly for 2014, because CMS, number one, they believe that there are sufficient funds to pay all the risk corridors currently. And to the -- I guess, there is, theoretically, a possibility that down the road in '15 or '16, there could be -- if there's a shortfall, we would contemplate that when we think that, that comes into play. But for 2014, we're very comfortable that the risk corridors are appropriate to record.","Bruce D. Broussard","And that's a small component of the number that we...","Steven E. McCulley","It is.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When you say small, is it under 10%, 5%? Just any range.","Steven E. McCulley","Probably, for the -- I would say, 15% to 20%, 10% to 20%, maybe, something like that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the way the math works is pretty simple. It's just, if you didn't get paid for that, it would just be 10% to 15% of that receivable brought to the bottom line would sort of be an earnings impact? Is that the way to think about it if we want to just sort of take that stance?","Steven E. McCulley","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just maybe talk us through the factors that drive your confidence on the medical trend for Medicare Advantage this year recognizing, obviously, a good start to the year? I'm just wondering what you're looking at that makes you feel confident that better-than-expected trend will be the theme for the full year.","Bruce D. Broussard","Sure, the admission rates that we're seeing are very, very favorable, not only for the first quarter, but they continue into the second quarter. Some people have said, \"Well, gosh, that's because there was such a bad winter.\" But I would point out that most of our Medicare membership is in the Southwest and the Southeast and, in particular, Florida. We don't have a tremendous amount of Medicare members in the Northeast. So our admission rates are very, very favorable, we believe, in large part, because of some of the clinical programs investments that we're making. We're looking at pharmacy information and what's happening from a generic use rate perspective and a mail order use rate perspective. And that's very solid. The number of people that are getting enrolled in all of the programs that we're constantly evaluating is increasing. The predictive modeling tools that we develop that identify folks faster and give us the opportunity to have a conversation with them are working better. So a lot of the things that Bruce has shared with you many, many, many times in the past seem to be creating a fairly favorable utilization environment. So we feel pretty good about that and that's why we took the step of wanting to invest more so that we set ourselves up better for the future.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fantastic. Let me just ask one other question, if I could, which is back to the commercial side and the 3Rs. Just so I understand, in the risk corridors, I thought the way it was going to work was it was going to be budget neutral, so that regardless to how much money HHS has, if there was a net -- more net deficit than surplus across all of the plans in the exchanges and all of the individual market, that HHS would make a proportional cut to the amount of recoveries that the plans would get. Is that a misunderstanding?","Steven E. McCulley","No, I think that's true over the course of the entire 3 years, Matt. So -- but they would take -- if there was a net deficit in 2014, then they would take proceeds from the '15 and move it in and settle up '14, so you don't really get -- you wouldn't get into a collection issue until further into their program if that persist. Do you see what I'm saying? Does that make sense?","Bruce D. Broussard","Matt, just to carry on that conversation. Keep in mind, one of the reasons why we're in this circumstance is as a result of the transitional policy that was decided by the administration around the underwriting and people being able to keep their own plan. So as we think about this and what it's impacting in 2014, and taking dollars from 2015 to '14, it really is a result of that policy change that's driving some of the circumstances we're in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was looking to get the starting point to think about for 2015 earnings. And so the 2 questions I would have would be, would you view the $0.40 to $0.50 of new investments in clinical programs as onetime or recurring? And then, secondarily, any onetime benefit with a favorable development or anything else that you'd call out as being unusual similar to the, I think, it was the $0.45 that you highlighted when you gave the 2014 guidance?","Steven E. McCulley","Carl, this is Steve. On the clinical investments, we -- the way I think about those is they're recurring, but there's -- there'll also be recurring benefits that go with those 2. So when you looked at the waterfall slide that we presented, the first one was a favorable item of $0.70 to $0.85. A lot of that was due to the investments we made in the prior year in those same -- in similar programs. So yes, we will continue to invest in the clinical program but there'll also continue to be a benefit from that.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then anything from a favorable development perspective that you'd call out?","Steven E. McCulley","No, it was -- it's too early to tell. I think in the first quarter, we had a little more than we expected. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out. And as we get further into the year and see how the rest of it -- see how the full year plays out and we give 2015 guidance, we'll update you at that time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Retail earnings guidance was lowered, but MLR was maintained. So I just want to make sure I understand the moving pieces. You just mentioned admissions were down, but MLR guidance was held flat. So I want to understand if the delta there was solely Sovaldi or if there was anything going on, on the acuity side or price per admit side. And then, since MLR was flat, it implies SG&A went up. So I just want to make sure that's just the investment spend and nothing else is moving around in your assumption.","Steven E. McCulley","I think that's right, Sarah. I think the only -- and I'm assuming you're talking about the retail segment, specifically. If that's the case, then what you would have in there is improvement in the MA trends. And you would have then the hepatitis C and the higher drug costs and those things are all kind of moving around in the benefit ratio ranges that we give in aggregate. So nothing really else happening there.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And what about the new members coming in? Is there anything that you could spike out on how they differ from your existing book?","Bruce D. Broussard","Are we talking about Medicare new members or...","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, the Medicare members.","James E. Murray","No, the Medicare members that we've gotten because of the significant growth that we experienced, we've been doing a lot of evaluations to make sure that nothing negative lurked out. And we've talked in the past about how when a member comes in, in the first year, they're probably a little bit less profitable, so to speak, than some of our existing membership. And they look fairly consistent with what we've seen in the past. They are getting into programs a lot faster than what had, had been happening in the past. So that will allow the beneficial effect of some of what happens in year 2 and 3 to accelerate. But nothing significantly different with the new members that came in here in '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just as, I know on the investment spending away from the clinical initiatives, you -- it looks like you probably reduced that about $0.10 to $0.15 in the EPS impact. And I know that was mainly targeted at exchanges and dual programs. What's sort of changing there? Is that run rate of $0.40 to $0.75 now more firm or is there still movement there? And does it say anything about your 2015 exchange outlook, I guess?","Steven E. McCulley","A.J., this is Steve. Yes, just to reiterate your question, the improvement from prior to now, the $0.10 to $0.15, is all a result of having more membership in the exchanges and increasing our revenue there, which allows us to get more scale over our operating platform, which is a good thing. So we are pleased with that. And I do think that's beneficial for 2015 because there is a scale issue that you have to reach in order to make this business work for us. And so I think we feel better about 2015 now than previously in terms of that business. In the duals and the exchanges, really not a lot has changed since last time. So I wouldn't point to anything. We continue to build that out and look forward to what happens between now and the end of the year. But -- and then, it's too early to give 2015 guidance, but I would say that we look for both those investments this year to benefit us going forward?","Bruce D. Broussard","A.J., on the exchange side, just to add to Steve's comments. One of the large assumptions that's going to have to be vetted out is going to be the rate increases because that's really going to determine how this business transitions from the -- to ours, the risk adjustment -- I mean, the risk corridors and the reinsurance to an ongoing business. And I think it's going to be important as we work with the states and the federal government on the rate increases over the next few years, and we're just beginning that process. So our outlook is that the membership is growing. And I think the membership will continue to grow in 2015. We feel that we're gaining some ground in our platform and capabilities on the service side and being able to meet the needs of our customers is really going to come down to these rates and how the rates are determined in '15 and then subsequently in '16.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I just wanted to follow up, actually, on the -- your hep C comments here. I just wanted to confirm that kind of $0.40 to $0.50 is above kind of what your previous run rate estimate was, and if you don't mind trying to share, maybe, what you're expecting there. And then just related to that, it seemed a little bit high to me just based on kind of the cost-sharings on Medicare and Part D. Is there anything within your books that might be driving it higher than the total population or anything this year you can do to mitigate the impact before pricing for next year?","Steven E. McCulley","Andy, thanks. This is Steve. I will start off by saying the $0.40 to $0.50 is the incremental impact. What we thought in our -- when we -- at this time last year, when we were pricing our Part D business, is that we knew these drugs were in the pipeline. We expected them to happen late in the year, and they came much sooner than expected. And that's the differential. So -- but the numbers are pretty significant for us. So on the -- obviously, CMS, when you go through the risk corridors and you get -- I'm sorry, the phases of the Part D benefiting, you get into the reinsurance phase, CMS ends up picking up most of the cost for these people that didn't get into the catastrophic layer of the Part D benefit. So we anticipate for our Medicare business have -- Medicare and Part D business having north of $1 billion of growth cost for these drugs in 2014. So it's a very big number. Obviously, the net impact to us is smaller. The net impact to CMS is very significant.","James E. Murray","And this is Jim Murray. As just a follow-up on what Steve had to say. For all of our retail businesses, these drugs weren't in our formulary. And then that changed on -- sometime in April. They were included in our Specialty tiers with the prior authorization. But frankly, what we're seeing is that when they go to a third-party appeal program, they're being overturned. And so philosophically, for the remainder of 2014 in most of our retail businesses, we're likely going to have to pay these for the individuals who are put forward by their physicians. When you think about it, we're talking about 1% to 1.5% of our population. And some percentage of those who will ultimately take advantage of the program, and there's varying levels of estimates in terms of how many will ultimately take that. I've seen some schedules that would suggest 20%. So we've tried to estimate what we think will happen in '14 and came out with the numbers that Steve talked about earlier. In addition to the initial regimen now, there's also the possibility that there'll be an additional piece added towards the tail end of the year that will make it more expensive. This is a unit cost problem. And we have to really have folks address that. We're going to put it in our pricing for 2015. And I would expect most of our competitors would do the same. But for '14, there's not a lot that we can do to offset the negative impact of this very expensive drug.","Bruce D. Broussard","And I think, just to add to that, it is a price. It's not a utilization issue from a -- the type of patients we're seeing, I think, were in line with the population as a whole. But as Jim is saying, this is going to have a significant impact on Part D pricing next year for a minority of the membership that's using it. And I think it's a public policy issue here on pricing that needs to be addressed because it's only going to get worse as we look at specialty drugs going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","As I'm looking at your individual commercial membership numbers directly, it looks like, as of April 1, your membership probably had gotten up over about 1.1 million. And your year-end numbers are a couple hundred thousand lower than that. Is that an allowance for nonpayment of premium or is there some other reason there? And if you could talk about kind of the percentages that you're seeing on that front I'd appreciate it.","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim. We're estimating that there'll be some churn in this business. That's kind of what we thought that maybe there'll be a lot of folks who go in and out of the program because some might go back into Medicaid. And so that's a part of our estimate. You're right that we're probably going to bump up against 1 million members in this program. And we're estimating that there'll be some level of terminations because of that churn. We're not -- we've never had this kind of business before. So that's clearly an estimate, and we'll see how that ultimately plays out.","Regina Nethery","It's Regina, Dave. Also on your question about payment of premiums, I think we're seeing 75% to 80%.","James E. Murray","75% to 80% for those that came in, in from January, February and March. Correct, sorry.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted a little more color on the crosswalk on Slide 12, particularly the first bucket, the $0.70 to $0.85 of net operational improvements. Was that mostly in the first quarter or is that sort of spread out over the course of the year? Just trying to get a sense for what we saw right out of the gate here.","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. There's certainly a chunk of that in the first quarter. But that's also spread out over the year. I don't have any -- I can't give you any specifics on that. But it is -- it's going to be throughout the year, with a chunk of it in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","As I look at the difference between the $0.50 to $0.90 headwind, with duals and exchanges going to kind of $0.40 to $0.75, I understand the $0.10 to $0.15 is more efficiency on the exchanges, because we have so much enrollment. But we have so much more enrollment that it seems like you're assuming potentially a better loss ratio. Is that the right assumption? Because if on so much enrollments, we've got the operating efficiencies it feels like we're expecting less on kind of MLR losses. Am I thinking about that right?","James E. Murray","Christine, this is Jim. All of what you're seeing there is the improving fixed costs scale impact. When we did our pricing for '14 long, long, long ago, there were various assumptions about the size of the pool overall and the size of the pool from the underwritten existing insurance business. When troubles began to happen during the course of -- when we had set our original pricing and when we gave you our first set of guidance, 90 days ago, the folks in Wisconsin, who are extremely intelligent, took the opportunity to try to negatively impact what we thought the overall MER position would be, given the reduction in the size of the pool and some of the transitional things that Bruce referenced earlier. We've left that exactly the same for this update. And what we're doing now is evaluating the medical claims that we see on that business to see how that comports with the overall models that the folks in Waukesha have put together, which are very sophisticated. And I can't say enough about those actuaries in Waukesha. And what we're evaluating regularly is how our medical claims bump up against that. And we feel very comfortable with that overall model guidance that was put together by that actuarial team versus our claims experience that we're seeing. We haven't changed our assumptions relative to our expense ratio since 90 days ago to see how that ultimately plays out for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the question or actually ask a separate question about your individual off-exchange book in the small group book. Two of your competitors reported growth and 1 reported a decline in the individual book, with some conflicting data around whether the margins are getting worse or better. So I wanted to understand, is this -- this is dependent upon your health risk in your off-exchange books, so as they're pooling risk and you can no longer medically underwrite what is the experience that you're seeing in the off-exchange book? Are your margins improving or getting worse?","James E. Murray","We have the legacy block of business, which represents our old underwritten business and that is, obviously, shrinking as people are moving into the ACA compliant plans. And I would say that we're not seeing a significant deterioration in the overall results. I think there has been a slight worsening in our legacy block of business. And obviously, over time, the legacy block of business, for us and all of our competitors, is going to shrink. And that will make the overall exchange pool a lot better than what exists today. The transitional policy changes that Bruce referenced significantly impacted the overall pool in the exchanges because those underwritten lives are still in the older plans. When they are allowed to move into the new ACA compliant exchange, that's when the risk pool will self-correct itself. So we don't see significant deterioration, but some. And it's going to wind down over the next several years. It would have wound down faster except for the transitional rule. So I don't know if I've answered all of your questions. But those are kind of the factors that we're having to deal with as we estimate a lot of the 3Rs and set our pricing as a lot of what's happening with, not only our legacy business, but also our competitors' legacy business.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the pool is shrinking and the MLRs are getting worse and it will take a few years to play out?","James E. Murray","Yes, not significant shrinkage. I think you also talked about small group. We're not seeing a significant deterioration in our membership in Small Group. That seems to be holding fairly nice. We did have a nice growth in the back -- last quarter of 2013, because a lot of our customers chose to renew their policies early. And we -- we're watching to see whether or not there's what we call other group movement out of the smaller plans into the exchanges. And we're not seeing a significant impact from that yet. But we are trying to monitor that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Wright with Monness Crespi Hardt.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted a real quick clarification, if the 3Rs is 6 75 [ph] at the midpoint and 50% is reinsurance, 10% to 20% is risk corridors, does that mean about -- you're assuming you're a net receiver from risk adjustment of about 2 30 million [ph], something like that?","James E. Murray","Those were your numbers. But that's -- we are a net receiver from a risk-adjustment perspective.","Steven E. McCulley","The only thing I would add, the reinsurance is more than 1\/2, so a little bit more than 1\/2. So...","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just is that net receiver position predicated mostly on the platinum enrollment? Or can you break that out kind of by your [indiscernible]?","James E. Murray","That's a piece of it. I would say more, more -- I'll use an example. I don't want to give any of the states that we're doing business in. So let's pretend we're in Montana right now. And let's pretend Montana has a very big Blue -- a big Blue Cross plan that has lots of share and we have very little share. You've all been reading in the papers that a lot of folks are saying that not many new participants are coming into the program, into the exchanges. What's happening is that people who had insurance before are what's populating the exchanges. And so in a Montana, if you've got a big plan there that has a big share, what's happening likely is that plan is getting a bigger proportion of underwritten members into their new ACA compliant exchange pool, while we had a small share. And so our membership that we're going to get, because we're smaller in a Montana, would be more aligned around folks who didn't have coverage before and not as many members who were underwritten. And so that's why, the sophisticated models that I talked about that the people in Waukesha put together, state by state they evaluate that kind of dynamic. And it's really amazing to watch because you have to evaluate the big share carrier in a particular state, what they're likely to do and the implication that, that has on us and we go state by state and we try to evaluate that from a -- not only from a reinsurance, but also risk adjustment and, ultimately, the risk corridor perspective. It's really an incredibly dynamic modeling process. But that's generally how we end up with some element of a receiver position in risk adjustment, is that dynamic that I explained about Montana.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bruce, clearly, you're playing in the government space. You own Medicare. You own the public exchange, but you partner on the Medicaid side. I was just wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts on your hesitancy in terms of owning the position there.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think, as we've discussed on many different occasions, we are excited about the ability to service the duals population, and it really aligns with our capabilities as an organization in helping people that are in need of -- in need as they use, heavily use, the health care system. In the TANF, specifically in the TANF population, we are really putting our toes in the water through joint ventures that to date have worked out well, as you can see in our projections that we will be bringing a lot of number of members coming over the next year. And we're still comfortable with that relationship, the relationships that we have, and it seems to be working well for our states, our partners and for us. As we've said in the past, we will continue down that road. If it doesn't look like that, it's working the best, then we would always be open to looking to expand our capabilities in the Medicaid area, specifically in the TANF business. So I think we've been fairly clear, the reason we would do that is to enter and be a leader in the Medicare -- in the duals business. But we would not do it on an individual basis and just to be in the TANF business. And that's what we're working through. And I think today we've been successful at the joint venture model.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew McQuilling with UBS O'Connor.","Andrew V. McQuilling - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just had one question on the exchange members and if you're able to use any of your clinical program infrastructure to ultimately help manage some of that cost? Is that part of the plan in why you're expanding the clinical program as fast as you are?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, it very much is. And I think as we articulated in the fourth quarter conference call, the reason why we are excited about entering these new populations, such as duals and, in addition, the individual exchange members, is because it closely aligns with our capabilities around our clinical programs. And I think, in my comments, I mentioned that we have -- that we identified about 8,000 members that are available for some of our clinical programs through our predictive modeling, and we're actually reaching out to them as we speak. But I do want to emphasize that the $100 million to $150 million expansion that we're investing in, in our clinical programs is really a result of our Medicare Advantage membership and the growth in that and being able to both service that membership on an ongoing basis and continuing to prepare for 2015 and the additional membership that we would get in 2015.","Andrew V. McQuilling - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Terrific. And then maybe, if I could, in terms of understanding better your exchange member health status, is Q2, you think you're going to have a pretty good handle on it? So right now, you haven't changed assumptions, but Q2, you think you'll know?","James E. Murray","Well, remember that we got -- I'm going to guess 200,000 or so in the first quarter and we got a big bolus of new members in the second quarter. We'll feel better about the cohort that came in, in the first quarter, although we've studied the heck out of them in terms of their pharmacy costs and their utilization and did a lot of the predictive modeling work that we do for the Medicare population with these -- with this group of folks. And we feel reasonably comfortable with what we've seen so far on that first cohort. We'll study the next cohort over the next several months. So I would -- I'm going to guess that sometime in the next 3 months, maybe 6 months, we'll feel very comfortable about it. I quickly want to add, a lot of what we're doing around our 2015 pricing, which is due right now, is based upon those old assumptions that we talked about. It's not what we're seeing develop with medical claims. And so I think there's a bit of conservatism built into our 2015 pricing because we haven't done anything to adjust our medical expenses for what we're seeing in terms of medical claims.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just a quick one. Was there a specific reason why you were not able to repurchase the \"normal\" amount of shares this quarter that we've seen recently?","Steven E. McCulley","Tom, this is Steve. No, there wasn't really a specific reason. We were working on the rate announcement with CMS. So that was in play a little bit. So that was something we were just keeping an eye on. As well as, I mentioned earlier, around the dividends, our dividend request under a little bit more scrutiny from the DOIs with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the way that fees are handled in the statutory financials. So just monitoring those 2 items was really all we were contemplating.","Bruce D. Broussard","So, in closing, let me thank you all again for joining us today. We are pleased, obviously, with our first quarter performance; better-than-expected membership growth, both in Medicare Advantage and in our new exchange-based products; increasing ability to help our members with the timely, data-driven clinical interventions and particularly those members with chronic conditions. And it does speak to, and I think a lot of the questions that were coming out about our clinical capabilities, to our goal of having clinical excellence via coordinated care.","Finally, I'd like to thank all the Humana associates on the call.

Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Finally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter 2013 results of $2.95 per share, significantly higher than our previous expectations of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. The results were primarily driven by the combination of strong operating performance in each of our business units, as well as some discrete items that have not been anticipated in our previous earnings guidance. These items include the settlement with the Department of Defense for certain contract claims and the benefit to our Medicare business for the delay in the federal government's implementation of sequestration.","Given this quarter's performance and the way we see the remainder of the year playing out, we raised our full year 2013 guidance to a range of $8.40 to $8.60 per share.","Since our last call 90 days ago, we've seen a great deal of activity across a number of fronts. Most prominently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued both its preliminary and final rate notice for 2014. The educational efforts and the comments in between those 2 CMS announcements demonstrates Congress' and general public's strong support to the Medicare Advantage program. In response to the public comments, CMS revised its trend assumptions to account for the assumption of physician payment fix to the sustainable growth rate.","However, the challenging rate environment for Medicare Advantage continues. In the final rate notice, CMS made adjustments to the risk coding recalibration formula that proposed in the preliminary notice such that combined with the impact of county rebasing, certain of our stronger markets will still see a rate pressure in the mid-to-upper single digits for 2014.","In aggregate, we anticipate our Medicare Advantage premiums from CMS will decline by 2.8%. Adding in the impact of the non-deductible industry fee, our government funding reductions for 2014 become well over 4%.","Given this level of challenge, together with the out-performance we are seeing thus far in 2013, at this point, we remain uncertain if 2014 will be a year of earnings growth.","We are dedicated to doing all we can to overcome these challenges. We are encouraged by the fact that the tactics we will use to address them have historical yielded positive results. In this environment, getting our cost below original Medicare becomes all the more important. This involves continued focus on our 15% solution, including the development of our integrated care delivery model, along with the types of clinical investment -- infrastructure investments I've outlined in our second quarter call last year.","Our better-than-expected earnings this quarter are a testament to the benefit of this focus and positions us more favorably for addressing the challenges of 2014. These challenges require us to increase the amount and scope of our investment and enhancing our clinical infrastructure and in preparation for our participation in the health care exchanges, including educational campaigns to help introduce the public to these new options.","Specifically, let me outline some examples to illustrate how some of our recent clinical infrastructure initiatives resulted in measurable improvements in clinical quality, efficiency and effectiveness.","We increased the number of care management professionals to 7,600 at March 31 from 4,400 a year earlier. We improved our new member predictive models and clinical assessment process such that 31,000 of our Medicare Advantage members are already enrolled in our chronic care programs compared to 4,000 at this time last year. The combination of our care management professionals and the early identification prospective members have resulted in enrollment of 180,000 seniors in our chronic care programs compared to 125,000 at this time last year.","By December '13 -- by December 2013, we will expect to raise to 275,000 members enrolled. We continued our efforts to accelerate our relationships with risk providers, as we continued the integration of our recent Metropolitan acquisition with our existing primary care assets. As of March 31, Humana employed has strategic investments or MSO contracts with nearly 6,200 providers nationwide, representing over 530,000 Medicare Advantage members.","We also include members covered by path to risk, the total nearly -- the total is nearly 940,000, compared to prior year of 800,000 or 47% of our individual Medicare Advantage members. We are in the midst of our -- preparing our bids for 2014. And we believe, once again, we will have a solid value proposition to offer Medicare beneficiaries.","Consequently, we anticipate a net -- additional net growth in Medicare membership in 2014. Our integrated care delivery model, combined with a favorable senior population demographics, continues to position us well for Medicare membership growth over the long term.","We are maintaining our positive long-term view across the enterprise. We are staying active in the dual eligible procurement processes around the country. Our pharmacy and wellness businesses are thriving, and our Employer Group business margins are improving.","In sum, despite the challenges ahead, our associates are engaged and excited about the positive impact we are having on our members' lives as we help them achieve lifelong well-being. I look forward to continuing to share updates with you as the year progresses.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Bloem for review of our financials.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll walk through our first quarter results before turning to our updated 2013 expectations and capital deployment plans.","Looking then at the first quarter, we are pleased to report earnings per share of $2.95, which exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance by $1.15. Additionally, our pretax income for the first quarter of $730 million represented an increase of $340 million over last year's first quarter.","There were many items impacting the over-performance for the quarter, the major ones are highlighted on the slide. First, our first quarter 2013 results included the beneficial effect of a $48 million, or $0.19 per share, favorable settlement with the Department of Defense in connection with the TRICARE matter that we discussed on the second quarter 2012 call.","Additionally, the 1 month delay of sequestration increased our pretax income by $18 million or $0.07 per share versus our previous guidance. You will recall that we assumed in our 2013 Medicare bids that sequestration would occur on January 1. So in comparing the first quarter year-over-year, approximately $50 million of the $340 million improvement can be attributed to the 3-month sequestration delay from January 1, its originally intended start date.","Of course, since sequestration became effective on April 1, this year-over-year favorable comparison will not continue for the remainder of the year. Now the operating improvement of $205 million or $0.81 per share versus our prior first quarter guidance, primarily resulted from the following 4 items.","First, favorable prior period development. Relative to last year, we experienced $125 million more in favorable development, including $77 million more in the Retail Segment, mostly Medicare Advantage, as well as $61 million more in the Employer Group Segment.","Second, we also experienced favorable medical expense trends in most lines of business. This was primarily driven by lower levels of hospital utilization after the flu season, rapidly abated in the third week of January. Although we are pleased with the results of these favorable medical expense trends, we continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year.","It's important to note that when comparing the first quarter of 2013 with the first quarter of 2012, there was a significant medical expense benefit from weekday seasonality, including the absence of weekday in the first quarter of 2013. Weekday seasonality alone accounted for approximately $125 million of the $340 million improvement over last year's first quarter.","Third, our PDP business exceeded plan during the quarter, as we experienced a favorable drug utilization mix versus both plan and last year. However, as we re-project the members' progression through the various cost-sharing phases over the full year, we don't see the first quarter over-performance continuing to the same degree during the second half of the year.","Fourth, we also benefited from a lower operating cost ratio versus plan. As highlighted in this morning's press release, we experienced a year-over-year reduction in our operating cost ratio of 150 basis points in our Retail Segment and 110 basis points in our Employer Group Segment. Most of these operating cost reductions were anticipated in our prior guidance. But since we performed better than plan, we reduced our forecasted 2013 full year operating cost ratio by 25 basis points.","So in summary, with respect to the first quarter, these 4 items accounted for the $205 million or $0.81 per share of operating over-performance shown on the slide, with favorable prior period development accounting for a little less than half of that total, while the remaining 3 items accounted for the remainder.","In terms of the $340 million pretax improvement versus last year's first quarter, these same items apply, as well as the beneficial impact of weekday seasonality and the 1 quarter delay in sequestration that I discussed.","Finally, with respect to the first quarter, we picked up $0.07 a share as a result of revising the estimate of income tax liability associated with the non-deductibility of executive compensation, as is required by the health insurance reform law, as well as $0.01 per share from share repurchases. Again, both of these are against our previous guidance.","So turning now to the full year. The same items discussed for the quarter similarly impact the full year. However, most of the operating over-performance for the first quarter does not trend forward, primarily for 2 reasons. First, we do not and have not included any additional prior period development in our forecast. And second, while we're pleased with our first quarter utilization trends, we remain cautious in our full year trend outlook since we're only 1\/4 of the way through the year.","Importantly, and also as indicated on the slide, we expect to make further investments in our 15% solution and clinical care model. That will continue to enhance our ability to both improve health outcomes and lower medical cost in 2014 and beyond.","We're confident that the investments we have made to date are resulting in better outcomes and believe strongly that these investments will continue to pay off as we tackle the challenges of 2014 and beyond that Bruce described.","Finally, we're making additional investments in our exchange readiness and information technology associated with our individual Employer Group businesses. Both of these investments also will further prepare us for the future.","Now the final slide updates our 2013 operating cash flows and financial resources, as well as our capital deployment plans. With respect to our operating cash flows, first quarter 2013 operating cash flows were $412 million, or $81 million, 24.5% higher than those in the first quarter of 2012 after excluding the April 2012 Medicare payment received in that period. Accordingly, we've raised our 2013 full year operating cash flow guidance by $100 million at the midpoint to a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.","From the standpoint of our current financial resources, we're very pleased to report that after consultations with the various state departments of insurance and the credit rating agencies, we expect to receive approximately $970 million in 2013 dividends from our operating subsidiaries during the next 90 days. This amount compares with $1,220,000,000 in 2012 subsidiary dividends and will enhance our March 31, 2013, parent cash and investments balance of $202 million.","The $250 million reduction in 2013 subsidiary dividend primarily results from the higher surplus associated -- the higher surplus requirements associated with 2012 premium growth. You'll recall that premium growth is a major factor in determining the state required surplus amounts.","With respect to our 2013 capital deployment plans, we expect to continue our constant review of potential strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as capital projects, while at the same time consistently returning capital to our shareholders through both an increased quarterly cash dividend and a strong share repurchase program.","As noted in our press release, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to $0.27 per share. At the same time, it also refreshed our $1 billion share repurchase program through June 30, 2015.","Like the previous authorization, the refreshed repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.","With that, we'll open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to circle back on a comment that you made earlier about some of your stronger markets seeing mid-to-single upper digit impact from the risk coding recalibration. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color around that, maybe what percentage of your markets may have that scale of impact and if it's coming from the risk scores or the county rebasing to just help us understand a little better.","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray. The -- we have some markets in Florida, Louisiana and Las Vegas who, over the last number of years, as many of you know, are HMO-related and have focused on proper coding of the risk that we assume as a company. And some of those markets are seeing higher rebasing and recalibration adjustments than some of the other markets that we serve and are impacting us negatively, as Bruce talked about in his remarks.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And second question with the -- you mentioned the rate challenges spurring the $100 million in incremental investment for the 15% solution. So can you bucket the types of investments and speak to the time it usually takes to see a return on those specific categories of investment?","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray again. The things that we're investing in would be more clinical infrastructure, much like we did during the past year, which is beginning to pay the dividends that you're seeing in our restatements and our improving trends. Things that we're doing are hiring more clinicians. We've seen some success in programs that we refer to as SeniorBridge Humana Cares and some of the clinical assessment work that we're doing. We're in the process of hiring folks. We're going lower in the queue. We're determining that a certain category of individuals who go into those programs, not only from a quality perspective, but also from a cost perspective, we're seeing good results. And so we're going to go a little bit lower in the queue, and that's what's causing the extra infrastructure spend that we're talking about. That's a significant portion of the additional investment. We're also doing some things around marketing and messaging for the open enrollment, both for the Medicare Advantage and the HumanaOne, where we're going to see some exchange activities starting in October that we're pleased and looking forward to. And then I would also say that we're spending some money on the Medicaid infrastructure. Some of you have seen that we're doing some things in terms of winning bids in the Medicare space, and we're excited about that and we're spending to build out those capabilities going forward. So those are the things that we're talking about when we talk about the extra investment.","Bruce D. Broussard","And just to add to that. I think the investor should take away the investments that we're making are incremental, but the results that we have proven, especially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter of this past year, we've seen some great results of how these investments are or are just accelerating those to prepare for 2014.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Early in the call, you commented that you still see net enrollment growth next year. And I guess, when you couple that with the comments in the press release about 2014 growth still not being projected, I guess, can you give us a sense for what that would potentially imply for margins? And I know you've historically targeted a 5% margin in the retail book. Should we think about 2014 with regard to that margin as sort of a short-term step back potentially that you would again target that margin longer term? Or just any color around sort of the margin -- potential margin target as it relates to 2014 and beyond will be helpful.","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray again. We have talked about in the past the 5% margin. It's incredibly early to discuss anything relative to 2014. You all know that we're currently working on our bids. In fact, we've got teams of people in today and next week finalizing our bids. After we finish our bids and feel good about what we've accomplished, we obviously got to look and see what the competition does. We don't get a peek at that until October. And philosophically, I think you're going to hear more from us going forward rather than having an explicit 5% margin target, that we want to think more about long-term earnings growth and the implications of return on invested capital. And I'm not certain that you'll hear us say, \"Gosh, we want to have a 5% margin,\" but we want to grow our earnings meaningfully in the future. And I think we're going to try to change the dialogue around that going forward. And so don't look for a margin target, look for earnings growth targets going forward.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one follow-up. You've heard some of industry peers and just the general industry tone has sort of been that what we're seeing in 2014 with regard to rates is really more a pull forward of changes that the industry was expecting further down the road. And so just it's the pace of the cuts, not the cuts themselves. Can you give us a sense, in your opinion, the rate of acceleration? Meaning, do you see the 2014 rate cut being something that you have previously expected over 2 to 3 years? Or just any color around the acceleration there would be helpful.","Bruce D. Broussard","We can't give you specifics. This is Bruce. I can't give you specifics relative to the -- how much is being pulled forward. I do believe, based on all the analysis that's being done by MedPAC, that the Medicare Advantage rates are becoming equal to or less than the Medicare fee-for-service range. And I think that as you see that, a lot of the benchmark changes and all of the recalibration, I think, will slow down as we are continuing to have a higher value proposition when compared to Medicare fee-for-service.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake of JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is on the rates for 2014. Can you just tell us whether the 5% rate cut includes the improvement of Star bonuses that you had and the impact of industry taxes? And then can you give us an early read on your ability to improve 15 Star bonuses at the strong pace that you did for '14?","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, in regards to the rate, as the 4% that we talked about overall, that rate includes the Stars programs. So that does reflect that. It also includes the industry fee that you referenced. So it is an all-in rate. In regards to the Stars program itself, I mean, we obviously had a great year last year and demonstrated our commitment to the quality of our programs. And I think we'll just continue to make that investment. We're not prepared to say that we're going to be at the level on the improvement that we've seen in the past. But our commitment to it and our investments continue to be probably at the -- leading the industry.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And my second question is just a follow-up to what -- Chris' question on margins. So you talked about changing the dialogue to earnings growth and return on invested capital. And so if -- my question is on return on invested capital specifically. How should we think about that in terms of the Medicare Advantage business specifically? And if you are targeting a 400% RBC, what's a reasonable return on invested capital metric that we should think about for Medicare Advantage business at a minimum?","James H. Bloem","Yes, Justin. I think -- a couple of things here. One is, obviously, in the Medicare Advantage, because it's so much of our business. The operating leverage we get by adding additional members, which we reference, are, we believe, we have the ability to continue to do that, will improve that number. The amount of capital that we retained in the subsidiaries, as I mentioned before and is always done in conjunction with the states, and we got like 35 or 38 different operating subsidiaries that we do and each state has different requirements. We started for the first time in the press release today to put a return on operating capital metric in. And comparative to last year, it was 13.4%. And again, so that, as we've often stated, even when we talked about margins in the past, we talked about we were not really a margin expansion story as much as a membership expansion story. So we earn, as Jim said, more money as we continue to go along. And we earn that many that are over, what I would call, very efficient capital base. That's the invested capital part. So when we talk about our integrated care delivery and our clinical care models, we're talking about being able to put more members and to bring out and to build that infrastructure in a very capital-efficient way versus buying all -- buying different entities in each place or rather developing organizational competencies that can be then spread throughout our entire network and that way enhance our return on capital without being capital inefficient to do it, without using all the capital that would require to build a completely owned integrated system.","Bruce D. Broussard","Justin, just to add to that, I think a few important points as we look at our membership growth. In our segmentation analysis of our members, we have really proved out that the long-term value of a member is not just the first year and continuing to have a relationship with that member over a 7- to 10-year period that time has allowed us to historically grow, and we see that continuing going forward. So as we look at our growth, it's not only how we look at it year-by-year, but it's also the relationship that we established over the years with that individual. The second aspect is, as we look at the organization and probably a little different than a number of our competitors, is that our growth has been primarily around organic growth, that the members have come in and we have grown, not as much from an acquisition point of view, but from the ability to grow members based on the sales and marketing and the value proposition we have. And we look at that as a very key differentiator from an investor point of view as you go forward. I know your question was specifically, what are we going to look at a 10% or a 15% or a 7% kind of return on capital for our Medicare Advantage? And I think what we look at is over the long term, we will continue to exceed our cost of capital through organic growth and long-term value that we receive from our members as having a long-term relationship with them and continuing to enhance their -- the care model through that relationship.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry. Just the 13% then, is that a number you're comfortable with going forward? Should we think of it that way?","James H. Bloem","That's the number that it is today. And again, we would look at that number. And again, as we add membership, as we build out the capabilities across the network that we spent a fair amount of money in the last 3 years to build, then -- and so we look forward to being able to spend less, serve more, lower outcomes, higher R\/R, same or lower capital. But the capital in the subs is, right now, optimized at around the 400%, to get back to your original question.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you think that 13% is going in line or higher?","James H. Bloem","Again, we would say progressively, yes, we would expect to improve on it, but not in a predictive sense, but also balancing, again, all the business we have and running that again over the same asset base.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to continue on the topic of 2014 in Medicare Advantage. At this stage, is there anything you can tell us about how you plan to offset beyond your internal costs on medical and operating? Do you think this is going to be more member premium based, more benefits based? And if I could just add to that, how are you confident, at this point, in enrollment growth, given that you haven't finalized your bids? I think, Jim, you said it's incredibly early to talk about 2014 and you don't know what the member responses are or the competitor responses are going to be or, for that matter, how CMS is going to handle the plan approval basis?","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim again. As somebody pointed out, the net overall funding impact for us is somewhere between 4% to 4.5%. On top of that, you got secular trends that we're dealing with, which can be anywhere from 4% to 6%, depending upon the market. So the amount that we have to deal with, and I guess our competitors would likely have to deal with, is somewhere between an 8% to 10% -- 10.5% issue. The playbook that we talked about with all of you many times on the past is trend vendors. And you -- we've been successful in the past and you've seen a lot of investment spend specifically designed to enhance our trend vendors going forward. The risk coding improvement and some of the investments that we talked about today and at the end of the year are also focused on that. So we anticipate some lift because of those things. We've got premium and benefit cuts that we can evaluate on a market-by-market basis. The providers, some of the deals that we have with providers are risk-based and various forms of risk arrangements with providers throughout the United States, where they will participate in those cuts with us, and so some of that will be absorbed by the providers that we work with. And also, market exit is another thing that we can evaluate for those markets that don't make a lot of sense and are drags, if you will, on some of our overall results. We don't want to get into anything competitively as what's happening with many of our competition [indiscernible] includes some of the markets that we look at are better than what I just described, some of them are worse. We're dealing with something that you all know, called the TBC, which I would tell you may have had some unintended consequences because we're evaluating that in terms of whether we want to exit a market now. But when I get done and the team gets done looking at all of this and we've been talking about it for 2 weeks now, there's still a significant economic value that we provide to the members that we serve. And in addition to that, the assets that we have as a company that we've been very proud of, marketPOINT being one of those and the relationships that we worked hard to develop with the members that we serve, which Bruce referenced in terms of 7- to 10-year relationships. Because of all of those things and I think our brand as a company that focuses on the senior population, I feel very comfortable in our ability to grow our membership year-over-year, regardless of what our competition does.","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, Matt, to add to that. I think a few additions. I think the assets that Jim referred to -- our sales force, our brand, our clinical capabilities is going to be very important in the future as a result of that becoming a tighter and tighter business relative to both margins and the ability for a competitor to earn reasonable return in this business. And I think the stronger will get stronger and the weaker will get weaker and the barriers to entry in the business are increasing as a result of these pressures. And I think companies like Humana are positioned well to take advantage of the demographic growth that is happening. And I truly believe, and I think what this quarter demonstrates, that our ability to add value clinically when compared to the Medicare fee-for-service program is a great, great example and I think has long-term fundamental growth for the organization and the ability to add value back to the industry.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just one follow-up, which is I appreciate the slide that you guys provided on the projected and past funding impact changes. As we look back at 2010, which was the biggest one in recent history to the negative, certainly, can you quantify or at least broad side of a barn, how you offset that looking back and recognizing that how you offset it in '14 may not be the same, component-wise?","James E. Murray","I'm old and graying. As time goes on, I'm not sure I could remember exactly what happened in 2010. I will tell you that the multiple effect of 4 years of rate reductions is having somewhat of an impact on our economic value proposition. But I, frankly, don't recall exactly what it was in 2010 which drove some of the favorable results that we experienced as an organization.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just you talked how you want to focus a bit more in the future on earnings growth, long-term earnings growth than return on capital targets. Just given that, can you help us frame what you're thinking in terms of a long-term earnings growth rate for the company?","Bruce D. Broussard","We traditionally have not shared that with the street side, rather stay away from that question.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That is why I asked, but I guess we'll wait for further details on it. Also, just did want to ask a question on the exchanges. And first, just if you can give us an update on how many exchanges you're planning on participating in for 2014. Then I noticed that you did reduce the amount of individual membership that you're expecting to see in terms of declines for this year and just wanted to get a sense of whether that was just because the individual growth was better in the first quarter or are you now expecting less attrition in the back half of the year in the individual market than you were previously anticipating?","James E. Murray","Yes, to your question on the exchanges. On the individual exchange, we -- I believe the team is aligning around participating on 14 exchanges in various -- of the states that we have significant network strength and we're pretty excited about that. And to your second question, the team was a little bit surprised about the growth that we saw in the first quarter, and that is the impact that improves our guidance and not so much what we expect to happen when the exchange goes into play in October.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So you're still thinking about maybe a high-single-digit-type attrition in individual in the back half of the year?","James E. Murray","Correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In the past, you guys have talked about moving toward a 50-50 HMO-PPO split by 2017 in your MA book. Is -- the concept, I guess, has been that you move up a few percentage points a year. Can you talk about whether you can accelerate that? And if you could accelerate that, how much does that help you mitigate some of the pressures we're seeing in the MA book going into next year?","Bruce D. Broussard","I'll start it off and then Jim can add to it. Obviously, we -- our goal is to obtain the 50%. And if you look at where we're at today, including our path to risk, we're at about 47%. And that path to risk really gives an indication of our relationships with our providers and how we'll eventually move them to a full risk-taking relationship on that","aspect. The second question relative to how does it help us, it does considerably help us because we have found with an aligned around quality and cost -- our quality of care, when as indicated by Stars and other educators like that, along with the cost, are superior. And so we see the more we can do that, the better we will be positioned to deal with rate reductions like we've had in the past. But that will come in blocks. In other words, it's not going to just a straight line. It will be -- will have to take a period of time. Mostly at the first part of the year, you'll see those changes. Jim, do you have some other comments?","James E. Murray","All right on. And the only thing that I would share is in, I'm sure everybody on the phone recognizes this, that the reason that we're focused on this is it moves the care delivery from focusing on an individual sickness to focusing on an individual's wellness and trying to get in front of some of the events that individuals have. And to Bruce's point, that then, as that plays itself out, really gets to the satisfaction that we enjoy when we have those kinds of models. So it's just a win-win as we move towards that more population health kind of a perspective.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe if I...","James E. Murray","A.J., we will just continue to keep forward -- to have some forward-looking in how we are doing in our path to risk relationships and how are those relationships evolving, both moving to an HMO model and in addition, how we are continuing to build better relationships with their providers.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just on the balance sheet. One of the strengths has been that you're relatively, I don't know if under leveraged is right word, but modestly levered certainly compared to the peers. Given the environment we're in, I could see where you might want to maintain that. Alternatively, you got strategic investments you're making to build out your integrated care delivery network strategy and so forth. Can you comment on balance sheet priorities and thoughts about the leverage?","James H. Bloem","Yes, I think -- and again, it's a very good question, comes back to the ROIC a little bit. But if you look at basically what we have as an opportunity, always in front of us are -- we're looking for acquisitions, strategic investments and CapEx. Those are the things that really improve the value of the company. And then we look at the appropriate level of capital that it takes to do this. It's got a regulatory component. It's got a rating agency component. And it's got, as you would say, there's some value in keeping some optionality. So when you look at all of that, I think that we've done a fairly balanced job in the last 3 years of returning about 50% of what's available back to the shareholders in the form of cash dividends, which, 3 years ago, we didn't pay and now we do. And much enhanced share repurchase. And then -- but again, always focusing on how can we make the company more valuable through CapEx, through strategic investments, which are the noncontrolling kinds of things we did. So for example, last year, we spent basically $1.8 billion doing that. We increased the leverage ratio or the debt-to-total cap ratio from 15% to 22%, still below our peer group, but now toward the bottom end. And we also, when in discussing it with the regulators and with the credit rating agencies, have said that we think that, for our category, a 25% to 30% is an appropriate level. And they've acknowledged that in writing, in terms of when they write up about, for example, their credit rating of us. So again, it's an optionality. It's appropriate use of capital. As I said earlier, it's an efficient use of capital to build out these capabilities so that we still have a lot more optionality left and we can weather what other -- whatever uncertainty is out there or whatever opportunity presents itself.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So shift to ROIC focus. I guess a couple of questions around that. One, I have to assume, Bruce, you've realigned management incentives to some sort of ROIC targets. I'm curious if that's around improvements on an annual basis or if those are just absolute targets. The second question around it, I guess, would be what was the catalyst to change? Was there sort of a change in management and relooking at the way you guys think about value for shareholders, et cetera? And then the third part of it, and I apologize for cheating here, which was sort asked, which is if you look at the attractiveness of buybacks, I assume in your ROIC model they become much more attractive. So would you expect a different pace of buybacks going forward with the understandings around what Jim just said to the last question?","Bruce D. Broussard","Let me -- my memory is always short so let me try to answer those. If I don't answer them properly, reroute it. In regards to the management incentive plan, I think you saw an announcement or an 8-K around a performance share-based plan that we filed, I think, last month or so. One of those components is actually the ROIC-related indicator. So for the management team, we are very much aligned in that aspect. Even before my arrival at the organization, ROIC was an important part of the organization. And Jim, in fact, I think my second day on the job, Jim brought a slide to me that showed ROIC over the last 10 years and how the company has performed on that regard. So it has been an active part of the internal management of the business, but really was never incorporated in the compensation side. And working with the comp committee and also working with the management team, we concluded, as we look forward, that ROIC gives us the best indication of the right investments to make, and in addition, being right aligned with the shareholders. So for us, it's -- I think it's a good indication for the shareholders that we are walking side-by-side with you and over the years, demonstrates the long-term success of a -- of returns for our shareholders. In regards to the buyback side and regards to accelerating that, I think we continue to maintain the posture we've maintained historically and that is, is that we'll make the right investments, both in giving money back to the shareholders, and at the same time, making strategic investments in that regard. And I -- this program should not weigh that decision one way or the other. I think it will continue to be what we've done in the past. And as we see more clarity in the business and opportunities to deploy the capital back to the shareholders present itself, then we'll obviously be sensitive to that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And maybe, Bruce, if I could just sort of ask to follow up on that. You talked about ROIC, obviously, and you juxtapose that was moving away from margin target. The incremental return on invested capital for a new member, even at a significantly lower margin than the overall book, will be significantly higher than your existing 13%. So should we think about this as a new strategy and one in which you think now is the time to really put pressure on your competitors around the products that you are going to bring to market for new membership growth?","Bruce D. Broussard","I think -- I don't -- wouldn't say it's a different strategy. I think it's just taking -- it's an extension of what we're doing already. But I do believe it is taking into account the long-term value that we see in having a relationship with the Medicare member and being able to look at our earnings, not only just on the short-term earnings basis, but really on the long-term aspect of adding value to both the member and our shareholders. So I wouldn't call it a change, and I wouldn't say that we're just going to go out and grab share irresponsibly. I think it is just a constant way to say what is the best interest over a 3- or 4-year period of time for our shareholders and our members and how do we look at that as opposed to just looking at a year-by-year bid strategy. And that's how our decisions are made.","James H. Bloem","And if I could just add about the share repurchase then. Looking at share repurchase versus making the company more valuable, you're right, when you look at should we buy back stock or should we invest in CapEx or acquisitions or other strategic investments, you get the 1 year pickup when you do that. But over time, when you make those investments, those investments make you money year after year after year. And that's what really -- that's really what the trade-off we look at when we look at how much shares to buy back and what the real priority. So what I said earlier about you first go after things that make the company more valuable, that's why you do that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. I was thinking more against dividends, right? Buy back significantly, more enhancing ROIC than dividend.","James H. Bloem","Yes, well, both help you get to the appropriate level of capital, which is really what this is about. And when Bruce mentioned that we've been running the company like this over the years, that's really what it's been about. That and making sure that, that return we get exceeds the cost of the capital that we have.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ana Gupte of Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I was trying to get a sense for the offsets that are available to the ability to preserve margins to a more quantifiable level, not just for 2014, but also going forward. So you put a very fine point on your rate headwinds for 2014. I think it's very close to 5%. And then you have, let's assume, 3% basic cost trend. If you look at the mitigating offsets, I'm just -- let's just assume you exercise the entire TBC. That's about 3%, the $34 PMPM that they offered, and then assuming you have about a 1.5% to 2% ability to do risk adjusters. So the things that are left to you would be SG&A, moving to this global full-risk model and vertical integration. So with where you are on those 3 and you have probably more potential than some of your competitors, given your starting baseline, can you give me some color on what you could do in '14 and what might be the potential run rate going forward?","Bruce D. Broussard","No. We're in the middle of bids and this is a very competitive environment. Some markets look better than other markets. We've got all kinds of the things in our toolkit that we're focused on in certain markets. Some of those tools are more impactful than in other markets. And next week, when we do our, what we call, our lockdown meetings, we'll get a sense for how it's all rolling up in total. But for purposes of competitiveness, I'd just as soon tell you that we're working really hard to figure out where we need to be market-by-market. We've been successful in the past with this effort, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll be successful again for next year.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. Well, let me just go back to the chart that you've been showing us then on the Investor Day and some presentations after. You have a 70% cost base relative to Medicare for the full risk, and I think it's 90% for no provider incentives. If you just work off of that, the full risk includes vertical integration or you're just talking about a contracted model? And where are you right now on that spectrum? I thought I heard a number in response to A.J.'s question. So what are you targeting? One could work off of that and get a sense for what -- where you might be in '14 and then beyond.","James E. Murray","Yes, I think Bruce referenced earlier, if you look at where we're at now, I think he referenced 47%. And as we -- one of the other areas of investment that we have for 2013 is accelerating the acquisition of primary care physician practices and building primary care physician practices where we're excited about what's developing there. We have 17 clinics that we're in the process of building where we just closed on a recent acquisition in Texas with a medical group that we're very, very pleased about. Those efforts are going to accelerate. I think the last time we were together, we talked about the desire to acquire 1,000 physician practices over the next 3 years. And so all of those things are going to be part of what you're going to see us focusing on as we move more from insurance to care delivery. But again, right now, it's really early. It's May, I think it's May 1. And so providing color and numbers relative to how we're going to do in '14 is really, really early. There's too many things that yet need to be figured. But we're really, really focused as an organization on expanding our clinical model, moving our relationships more to be risk-based and that's what we wake up thinking about day in and day out.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And then, finally, on -- so I mean, I'm reading this as -- if I just look at this and put some rough math, it seems me that the offsets could even lead you to keep margins flat, but I'll leave it at that. And then the second thing on run rate SG&A...","Bruce D. Broussard","Okay. I hope you enjoyed it.","Regina Nethery","Ana, go ahead with your question. You were asking about SG&A?","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. Yes, I was asking about run rate SG&A. So your 8.9%, $100 million is onetime investments. Do you see those continuing into '14? And then can you just give me a sense of your run rate expectations, of what SG&A could look like sort of run rate?","Steven E. McCulley","We do have -- I think you're referring to the $100 million invest -- I'm sorry, this is Steve. On the $100 million investments, most of those are going to be in the clinical space and they'll be quality related. They won't -- a lot of that won't be in the admin cost. You did see our retail SG&A ratio improve nicely year-over-year and that's certainly a part of the strategy. So having scale here is important. And we do have a good plan for 2014 to continue to bring the SG&A ratio down. I don't think we want to guide to that number today. But you'll see continued improvement in that metric as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on what the rate cut means, if anything, to your ability to kind of move, along the spectrum to risk. I mean, how are your physician partners looking at this rate cut? I mean, you mentioned that you've got some capitation in here, which provides a little buffer versus rate cuts. But for the physician side of things, if you're trying to get someone to move along the path to risk and now you're telling them that the target earnings potential for them is probably going to be lower than what you might have thought otherwise, how do you think about that? And is there some functional limit to how much you can end up kind of flexing down on capitated membership because the doctor is going to need x percent increase versus fee-for-service to get them to do all the work that needs to be done to really be integrated?","Bruce D. Broussard","In general, what we're seeing in the physician community is that they're -- they have pressures from all sides. So I wouldn't -- this is a relative measurement, and I think any pressure that's coming from Medicare Advantage is probably multiplied in the commercial space, and in addition, in the Medicare fee-for-service space. So I would say that in the proper setting, this is actually a benefit for the physicians because it allows them, as Jim said, to move from treating patients to the ability to look at patients from a -- from their health point of view and evolving them. And we find that physicians are excited about that because it becomes less of a volume game and more around quality and cost. And so we find them to embrace it. In regards to how much can we flex, I mean, we continue to believe being a partner with physicians is important, and therefore, our ability to flex and push rates down are dependent on our relationship with them. I mean, we have contractual relationships and with a lot of the groups out there today and those contractual relationships allow us to pass those rates on and the reduction to them, which we will do. But what we are generally seeing in the marketplace is that physicians and organizations do much better when properly given the tools and given the proper motivation in a risk-based environment than a fee-for-service environment. And if we can help through our path to risk programs and our ability to invest and help them evolve, we think we have a long-term success in those relationships and really are helping them out in the pressures outside of Medicare Advantage.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you don't see any real change yet on the physician engagement side of things as far as their willingness to move that. So then -- so I guess, on the -- another question would be, as you thought about moving these -- your businesses from an unintegrated PPO product to more integrated product, more HMO, my guess is that probably some of the benefit that you were looking to get was going to be from coding. And if you think about a few hundred basis points delta now versus between where you thought you might get to now with the final rule to where you actually will get, it doesn't sound like you've really -- with the fact that you think you're going to grow membership next year, it doesn't really sound like you've dramatically changed the -- your thought process around what markets are viable over time. So I just wanted to understand that a little bit. How do you think about 2014 as the year to get out? Do you get out of a market today if you feel like it's going to be marginally profitable tomorrow but then unprofitable in 2015? Or do you really wait until it turns negative before -- or do you get out today or do you wait until that turns negative before you make that decision to pull out of a market?","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim. The market leadership has put together a document, if you will, that evaluates 80 markets throughout the United States. And they've put together their strategies and plans and the relationships that they want to create in all of those markets. And what falls out, there are some markets where the provider systems that exist in those particular markets are such that we don't see any kind of long-term success there. And so for that reason, it's likely that those are markets that we need to think about differently than we have in the past. And the other dynamic that I mentioned earlier is this whole PVC calculation, and the teams understand the mechanics of that a lot better than I do. But what it creates is a dynamic that over time, if you don't choose to exit today, it could get worse for you. And so they're stepping back and they're thinking really long term about a particular market and they're choosing, I think, this year to say, \"Maybe it's time to close up shop.\"","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So you are proactively looking at things on a longer-term basis this year. Even with that decision process, you still feel like 2014 is going to have net membership growth?","James E. Murray","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Windley of Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping to get some of the trend benders in a slightly different way. So you commented about the increase in the number of members in chronic care programs, increase in the number of members in care management. Can you give us a metric or a delta on what the difference is in the cost experience on those members that are in those programs versus not? Or how much the improvement -- how much of an improvement you see when you get them in those programs?","James E. Murray","We have a team of actuaries that have evaluated the new enrollment in all those programs and they do regular evaluations of savings. But I hate to talk about it that way. I'd rather talk about it more from a quality perspective. And by the way, it's really good from a cost perspective as well. Suffice it to say, that I told you earlier that we're going to go lower in the queue. So that tells me that there's tremendous opportunity to get folks in these kind of clinical programs that stabilize them in their homes. They're well received. The members love them. We love them. It's the right thing to do. And -- oh, by the way, it's starts with the trend benders. And I'd rather not to talk about ROIs and things like that because I just don't think that's the right way to think about it.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. So Jim, if I ask a different way, last year, when you stepped up -- when the company stepped up investment, I think it was a $46 million number expected to generate $200 million to $300 million in cost structure improvement, has the payoff on that investment paid off to that degree?","James E. Murray","Well, I think we reported some fairly strong earnings in the first quarter and you saw some favorable restatements from last year. I think a lot of the spending that we did because we have the second quarter issues, which was embarrassing for us, are beginning to pay dividends this year. And we feel good about what's happening in 2013. They need to continue in order for 2014 to be a good year for us as well.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could throw in just a couple of quick ones, housekeeping, I think. The health care services metrics page, the owned JV primary care providers under risk actually went down and I wondered what drove that. And then, Jim Bloem, if you could perhaps quantify how much flu cost ended up being in the first quarter?","James E. Murray","Let's go on record of saying that, that was way over 2 questions, but we'll answer it.","Steven E. McCulley","I will -- let me -- you're trying to fit the record. David, this is Steve. So on your second around the flu. I think what we've said before is, as I recall, that the first quarter impact was around -- we estimate it to be $50 million. It was maybe a little less than that, not -- it was still a significant event, but maybe it ended up being a little bit less than that. The flu admission data that we looked at really just ended sharply in the third week of January. And by the time we got to week 4 in January, it was a nonevent for us. So I would say it was a little less than what we said before, but not materially. So I'm not sure about your provider count question. I don't know if anyone else has a...","Regina Nethery","This is Regina. I think it had to do with -- we had one provider group that was acquired by someone else, so small change associated with that. But other than that, it's been growing quite nicely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is there any reason to assume that the coding intensity adjustment and the recalibration adjustments would pass less to your providers than, say, the sequestration cuts did?","Bruce D. Broussard","I don't -- I wouldn't -- I'm trying to follow that, Peter. I don't think so. I mean, I think in our relationships that we have, I mean, it's a percentage of...","James H. Bloem","I think of the same, yes.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the premium tax then, that wouldn't pass as readily to the providers, I would assume. Is that correct?","James E. Murray","We're in the process -- some of our contracts stipulate that, that gets explicitly passed down. Some of our contracts, it's kind of a relationship and negotiation, and we're in the process of working with all the provider partners to pass as much of that as possible. You have to step back and say, \"Gosh, we can keep pushing down a lot of stuff, but what do we have at the end of the day because we've done some damage to the provider network that we think is one of our strongest assets?\" And so that's just a market-by-market, provider-by-provider evaluation that we need to make and I know the team that's out there does a lot of smart things in terms of evaluating all of that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second question. Your health services business stayed flat in terms of contribution year-over-year. You're talking about stepping up spending to continue to improve that. Will that -- so I assume it's going to be more negative in terms of performance going forward. Are we going to see earnings ever come from that business? Or is that always going to be sort of a receptacle for some of your spending as opposed to where you're seeing the performance show up on the plan side in terms of earnings improvements?","James E. Murray","Earlier, I referenced the 1,000 physician practices that we're targeting, acquiring over the next several years to set up -- us up well for the long term. When we began to provide that infrastructure and that business, I would expect that you're going to see some really strong earnings growth in the future. Not to mention the pharmacy business, that is a wonderful contributor for us and has been over the last number of years. So I believe the health services organization, after we get through this period of investment spending that we've detailed, will be a significant contributor going forward.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Will that be in 2014? Or when will that be exactly?","James E. Murray","I would estimate that we'll see the beneficial effects of a lot of this probably more in '15 because we've got some issues relative to '14 with some of the pushdown that I talked about of these funding cuts that are -- is going to impact those businesses in '14. I would expect that you'll see some nice lift starting in '15.","Bruce D. Broussard","And I think, Peter, I know you're looking at the financial statements and the like, but when you peel it back, that division is a large contributor to the organization as a result of all of the great clinical activities it has going on. And in addition -- and also the relationships it creates with our members. So I look at it as much broader than just the financial results that's in there. And that's why you see us being very bold in our investments in that area because we are seeing some really good things that show up in the Retail Segment, but wouldn't occur without those investments in that particular segment.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just the last question. I assume most people in this call have always appreciated the work Jim has done here. But can you update us on the CFO search?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes. And we all -- I sort of stutter here because we respect the dickens out of Jim. And -- but we understand that he would like to enjoy some time outside of Humana, so we appreciate that. But the same time, he has been very gracious in allowing us a long-term transition and helping whoever fills that seat as having a successful transition for that. That being said, we are in the market today, beginning to both interview internal and external individuals for that position. We anticipate that we will have somebody in the latter part of the third quarter and that will allow time for Jim to help in that transition and really have a dual transition in that aspect.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Christy Arnold of Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","About 20% of your Medicare Advantage medical cost were capitated as of the end of 2012. Is it possible -- I know you said it's early and you're still working with your relationships. Is it possible to give some estimate of how much percent of premium capitation you'll have in 2014? And then how should we think about the impact of 2014 payment changes to your Employer Group profitability? Do you have multiyear contracts? Can you pass along these cuts? How does that work?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. I'll handle the capitation question. I think you said that 20% of our medical expense was capitation expense currently. And what might that do in '14, we would expect it to increase some. I don't think we're guiding to that number. And then, I'm trying to recap your question. We currently have about 26 in change percent in risk arrangements -- for HMO risk arrangements and about half of our total Medicare membership is in an HMO. That means that there is a portion that are in HMO arrangements where there's not risk going on, but there's still primary care capitation involved and maybe some specialist capitation involved. And what will happen over time is some of those members and providers in those buckets will move to risk models over time. And we've guided to, by 2017, having us up to 50% of our membership in the risk arrangement. So we haven't guided to how much is going to happen each year. But it stands to reason that the capitation expense, as a percentage of our total expense, will increase in '14 and '15 as we move the -- transition the model down the road.","James E. Murray","Christine, this is Jim. Could reask -- I apologize. Can you reask your Employer Group question again?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, we're looking at kind of the negative 8% to 10% spread. And I'm wondering, do you have multiyear contracts with employers such that you won't be able to pass that on? Or is it pure negotiation? Can all of that be renegotiated to pass some of that on in different ways? Or is there an issue with Employer Group that we should know about, given the negative spread?","Regina Nethery","And you're talking group MA, correct, Christine?","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, yes, exactly.","James E. Murray","The contracts that we have with all the Employer Groups are generally 1 year. We have negotiations. Many of those negotiations are going on as we speak. There are negative spreads in -- and I described those earlier when I said, I think I said 8% to 10%. But those same toolbox items that we have for our individual also work for the group. And so I don't -- the spread is going to be reduced because of all those good things that we're doing. Group members also participate in SeniorBridge and Humana Cares, are also a part of the clinical assessments program. And so we're in the process of talking to a number of the large groups that we do business with. They're very excited and happy with the work that we do. One of the constant things that they do is measure where our premium that we charge for the RAP benefit relates to itself against the Medicare supplement opportunity. And we're always in pretty good shape with that right respect. So I feel very good about the group business going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to go back to that last part of the question on the group MA side. I guess, how do we think about the growth heading into 2014 maybe relative to the individual? And are there more levers to offset the pressure in that business than on the individual?","James E. Murray","I would tell you that I wish that more of the groups that we work with would be more willing to think about different benefit designs, so that we can get the members that we serve thinking more about wellness as opposed to sickness because a lot of those are more PPO-based than they are HMO-based. But again, the same levers that we pull for the individual business that exist throughout all the United States also impact the dynamics of the group Medicare membership that we serve. And so we have a lot of things and levers that we can pull to continue to create a value proposition for the Employer Groups that we serve there. But again, I wish they would be more willing to think about different benefit designs and get those members more engaged in their care delivery and working with us going forward. But I feel -- as I look out for the next several years, I see a lot of economic value that we can provide -- continue to provide those -- to those customers that we serve.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a little more on sort of near term. For the quarter, obviously, you saw favorable seasonality in PPRD that helped and that may not repeat and seasonality could actually potentially work against you, if any procedure sort of get pulled into 2Q. You have the sequester hit. You have incremental investments. So I guess the question is, just help us with the comfort and confidence that kind of raised the 2Q guidance at this point.","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. I'll take a run at that. So as we raise the 2Q guidance, we hadn't given Q2 guidance before, so we're raising the full year guidance.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, just relative to consensus, I guess, or our expectations. Sorry.","Steven E. McCulley","Okay. So I don't -- I'm not even -- I'm not sure what that was. But from our perspective, we did see -- I think what we were trying to point out with the seasonality and the sequestration in Jim's comments was just to highlight the fact that there's a lot of favorable things that are happening in 1Q. And if you look at our total guidance for the full year, the percentage of our earnings that we're earning in 1Q of '13 is a big percentage, much bigger than it's been in any recent history. And we're trying to point out the reasons why that's the case. The seasonality comparison this quarter-over-quarter, everything else being equal, is a big number just due to leap year last year and the way the Mondays and the number of days and the month fall, as well as the sequestration, which was delayed for us. So -- but still, there was underlying improvements in our trends and our SG&A cost. So as we look at those, we do feel comfortable raising the guidance for the full year. And obviously, the things that happened in 1Q increased the full year as they flow -- as they just flow into the total. So I don't know if that helps or not.","Bruce D. Broussard","And we want all those to continue and get bigger as the rest of the year goes on to position us nicely for '14.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Talked about facing bigger rate cuts in places like Florida. Those are also your strongest markets. They're best equipped to handle the reductions. So as you think about a scenario where earnings don't grow in 2014, are you more concerned about lower earnings in the strong Medicare markets or earnings pressure and\/or market exits in some of the weaker markets?","James E. Murray","This is Jim. I'm not sure that I have a particular one item that concerns me. The one thing that I would tell you, I don't know whether the team that's around the table shares this, is I'm not sure how 2013 is going to turn out. And if it gets -- continues to get better, comparisons to next year are going to be more difficult. But having said that, if '13 continues to get better, that's a nice target for 2014. I don't think of anything as a one particular area that I'm most concerned about other than the hill that we have to climb in terms of the 8% to 10% headwind that I kind of detailed earlier.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the second question, is it smart to shift the dialogue away from margins and to returns? So I'm thinking, at a 400% risk-based capital ratio and a 5% margin, the return on a Medicare member would be something in excess of 30%. So do you really want to highlight that?","James H. Bloem","Again, it's a matter of the way we look at it. As Bruce said and as Jim said, starting off, we want to improve earnings every year. And then we want to run that over our capital base that remains appropriate than meeting the same or less as we go forward.","James E. Murray","They took my CPA away a long time ago, but I think that earnings growth ultimately drives our share price. And so focusing on growing our earnings going forward each year will help us to drive our share price going forward. And so that's a part of how we're beginning to think as opposed to a margin target explicitly.","James H. Bloem","So as you continue to grow your membership, remember, we improve, as we've learned all of this together in the last year, we improve as the member stays with us longer and gets through these programs and gets the benefits of them. So that's the other part. As you grow, you continue to have new and that's what makes it, Carl, not just the math that you -- was in your question.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think most importantly, as you look at the business model, I mean, return on invested capital margin growth is the end result. But what we are affecting doing is really improving people's health, and at the same time, helping lower the cost of health care. And to us, the vision that we have is to able to return an adequate return to our shareholders, which I think over the years Humana has demonstrated.

Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Additionally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike McCallister.","Michael B. McCallister","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Humana reported third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $2.62, which exceeded our expectations of $2 to $2.10. We also increased our earnings per share guidance for full year 2012 to a range of $7.25 to $7.35 from our previous range of $6.90 to $7.10 and provided our 2013 financial guidance, with EPS expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80.","In addition, consistent with the succession management plan we first shared with you a year ago, we announced this morning that our President, Bruce Broussard, will assume the additional role of Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2013, while I will continue as Chairman of the Board. Humana's Board of Directors has been very pleased that the transition plan, originally outlined at the end of last year, has progressed in line with our expectations. Bruce has confirmed our Board of Directors' initial confidence in his ability to lead Humana successfully for many years to come.","I'm pleased now to turn the call over to Bruce, who will provide you with our strategic and operational update for the quarter, as well as a look ahead to 2013.","Bruce D. Broussard","Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased to have both the confidence of Humana's board and the support of our talented and dedicated leadership team as I assume the CEO responsibilities.","As Mike noted, our third quarter results came in above our guidance. Our earnings per share of $2.62 compares to our previous forecast of $2 to $2.10. Given these results, we now anticipate full year earnings per share in the range of $7.25 to $7.35, an increase over our previous guidance that primarily reflects a favorable prior period development during the third quarter, our operational progress and change in timing of some expenditures between the third and fourth quarter.  Our outlook for 2013 earnings per share is in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which includes approximately $0.30 per share for investments to accelerate and expand the development of our integrated care delivery model, which I will discuss momentarily.","Over the years, the integrated delivery model has demonstrated significant success through better outcomes, lower cost of care, higher member satisfaction and higher Star scores. The proof of this success is especially evident in our own experience with our CAC primary care operations in South Florida and our contractual relationships with organizations like HealthCare Partners, Metropolitan and MCCI.","More recently, our Concentra primary care acquisitions and our MSO joint venture investments also have demonstrated the value of the integrated care model. In that context, we advance our integrated delivery systems strategy with our announcement this morning of 3 complementary transactions. First is the acquisition of Metropolitan and our investment in MCCI, 2 MSOs which currently coordinate medical care for approximately 135,000 of our Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in Florida and Texas. These organizations, as well as our own CAC medical centers and the 55 PCP providers acquired by Concentra during 2012 provide the platform upon which we build a comprehensive integrated delivery model. Upon the completion of Metropolitan's acquisition and MCCI investment, Humana will employ or have strategic investments in or MSO contracts with medical practices that include 2,300 physicians nationwide.","As I referenced earlier, during 2013, we will continue to build on our integrated delivery strategy in 6 targeted markets with the acquisition of additional MSO assets and primary care physicians, resulting in an additional 300 to 400 physicians added to our organization. In addition to these targeted acquisitions, we plan to build approximately 15 primary and chronic care centers in the same 6 markets with MSO partners who have proven track record of success.","In addition, our acquisition of Certify is another component of developing an integrated delivery model. Certify's HealthLogix solution provides 2-way sharing of relevant clinical information across disparate electronic health records, connecting providers and allowing them to share patient health information in real-time. This function, combined with electronic communication and analytics from Anvita and Care Hub to proactively identify gaps in care, enhancing our care coordination with our own affiliated and contracted providers. As I mentioned earlier, our 2000 (sic) [2013] guidance includes $75 million or $0.30 per share cost related to these investments.","As we continue our transition towards becoming a well-being company by preventing, maintaining and restoring health through integrated care, we've identified in 8 must-haves in light of the changing -- facing the industry over the next 24 months. These must-haves are interrelated. Success in one will lead to success in another. Besides preparing us well for the 2014 health care reform, we believe they will stand us in good stead for years to come, regardless of government agenda. They include growing Medicare membership, expanding our risk-sharing primary care provider network, enhancing our chronic care capabilities, growing dual-eligible members and improving health care experience for our Humana members.","Our must-haves support 2 primary components of our core value proposition: affordable quality health care and enhanced and simplified member experience. Quality of care for our members is a critical component for our members' health care experience. That's one reason we are so pleased to have made significant progress in our Star quality ratings, published by CMS last month. 3 notable milestones are: first, Humana was the highest average Star rating among national Medicare companies; second, among national health care -- national companies, Humana showed the most improvement in Star ratings year-over-year; and third, our Wisconsin plan is the first plan offered by a publicly traded company to achieve the highest rating of 5 stars. We now have approximately 40% of our members in plans rated 4 stars or above. We expect that the disciplined dedication of our clinical team and our company's overall focus on quality care will result in further progress as the year unfolds.","Turning from the strategic to the tactical. A major focus for third quarter has been in implementing the clinical initiatives I've described for you in the second quarter call. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. Our first initiative is the early assessment of members to determine appropriate clinical program placement. We already have hired approximately 200 additional Humana care clinical professionals, expanding enrollment in these chronic care programs by 30,000 members. Second, increasing the number of clinical professionals located in our largest-volume hospitals who'll perform discharge planning activities. Approximately 100 nurses have been hired and are actively engaged in those activities. And third, increasing the number of in-home assessments performed by nurse practitioners, physicians and other partners. More than 20,000 of our 55,000 assessments have been performed to-date.","By quickly assessing our members' health conditions and needs and guiding them to the appropriate care pathways, we believe we are able to improve their health status, increase their quality of life, enable aging with grace in their homes and reduce the cost of institutional health care, thus improving their health care experience.","As we also discussed with you last quarter, our 2013 Medicare bids address several developing issues without compromising our competitive position. As we anticipated, the Medicare Advantage market will become more competitive in 2013 than it has been for the last few years. Nevertheless, we are -- believe our rational pricing approach for 2013 will result in net individual organic Medicare Advantage membership growth of approximately 125,000. In Group Medicare Advantage, we are forecasting growth of approximately 20,000 net new members. Combining our Individual and Group Medicare Advantage, our year-over-year organic growth will be approximately 6%.","In the standalone prescription drug market, the Humana Walmart-Preferred Plan produced industry-leading membership growth in 2011 and 2012. Two of our competitors have introduced a new value-oriented preferred network plan for 2013, replicating our national premium strategy, which we expect to create more competitive pressures for our PDP offerings. In light of this, we are anticipating net growth of approximately 150,000 standalone PDP members in 2013.","To conclude, this quarter, we've taken a large step in advancing our strategy of integrated delivery system, while successful addressing our second quarter challenges. As we look forward to 2013 and further implementation of health care reform, we believe capabilities, such as relationships with risk-sharing partners, integrated data processes and clinical analytics, combined with our national platform, will enable us to both assist the government, employers and individuals in addressing health care cost and improve member experience. In that context, we expect to bolster the development with our targeted acquisitions that contribute meaningfully to an integrated delivery model we are building.","We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day next week, where you'll be able to hear in more depth and in greater context about the initiatives I've just discussed. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim Bloem for a detailed analysis of our financial results and guidance.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Looking first at the third quarter results. We're pleased with our earnings of $2.62 per share. As noted on the slide, the quarter benefited by $54 million or $0.21 per share from favorable prior year medical claims development. The majority of this favorable development was in our Retail Medicare Advantage business, with a lesser amount benefiting our Employer Group results. The other 2 items of note were our Medicare Part D expenses and our operating costs, both of which experienced a shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","First, with respect to our Medicare Part D business, we experienced lower claims cost in the third quarter, primarily as a result of drug utilization mix driving member cost-sharing higher than we previously estimated for the quarter. However, based on our resulting forecast for the fourth quarter, we now expect to see our members stay in the initial coverage stage slightly longer than previously estimated, which will offset a significant portion of the third quarter drug utilization mix benefit. Accordingly, we've improved our full year outlook modestly by $14 million or $0.06 per share as shown on the slide.","Second, looking now at our operating costs. The shift from third to fourth quarter primarily was related to the timing of marketing expenditures in connection with our 2013 Medicare Open Enrollment campaign. The overall $11 million increase for the year, shown on this slide, is the net result of a $25 million increase in marketing expenses and a $14 million reduction in other operating costs. The additional $25 million for fourth quarter marketing spend was based on our October evaluation of our 2013 Medicare Advantage and PDP competitive positioning in all the geographies in which we operate.","And finally, all of the other third quarter items, including the lower share count due to share repurchases, were net favorable versus the previous forecast. Notably absent is any further deterioration in the benefit ratio of new Medicare Advantage member cohorts. The new member cohort benefit ratios have stabilized as both described and forecasted in our second quarter earnings conference call.","Turning now to next year. Our initial 2013 EPS guidance roll-forward is detailed in this morning's press release and on this slide. Let's look at each item in greater detail. Starting on the left, with the Retail Segment. We anticipate net pretax operating margin improvement of approximately $150 million. This net margin improvement reflects both the corrective actions included in our 2013 Medicare Advantage bids and the beneficial effects of continuing to build out our clinical programs. Each of these 2 factors was discussed in depth on last quarter's call and updated in Bruce's remarks today. However, there are 2 additional items that partially offset this Retail Segment improvement.","First, we expect an uptick in our 2013 PDP benefit ratio due to our competitive positioning. And second, we plan to spend modest amounts in preparing for the 2014 health insurance exchanges for our HumanaOne Individual business. In summary, after subtracting these 2 items from our expected Medicare Advantage results, we anticipate a $150 million year-over-year Retail pretax income improvement. This amount and this improvement are expected to equate with our ongoing overall target margin of approximately 5%.","Looking at the 2013 Retail Segment membership growth. Although we expect significant new Medicare Advantage organic growth of approximately 125,000 members, as well as an estimated 150,000 net new members in the standalone PDP, we've included a modest beneficial financial impact of $25 million in our initial 2013 earnings guidance. This conservatism is based on the observations and margin experiences that we discussed in depth on the second quarter call with respect to new Medicare Advantage members. Additionally, we anticipate a decrease of about 45,000 individual HumanaOne members in the second half of 2013, as January 2014 approaches and individuals discontinue shopping for coverage in the current marketplace, while awaiting the startup of health insurance exchanges.","Turning next to the Employer Group Segment column. We continue to anticipate a small uptick in commercial claims trends toward their historical levels. In both our 2013 guidance and our 2013 pricing, we have anticipated an annual trend increase of about 150 basis points, plus or minus 50 basis points. This increase is the primary driver of the $90 million decrease in expected 2013 pretax income shown on the slide. These 2013 assumptions are comparable to the ones used in 2012 for our Employer Group earnings guidance at the same time last year. However, as estimated by our expected 2012 full year Employer Group results, commercial trend has not increased by as much as we originally anticipated through the first 9 months of 2012.  Although we continue to expect a future trend increase, there remains some uncertainty as to the timing and the slope of that eventual trend increase. Suffice it to say, we believe that we've been prudent in both our 2013 commercial group pricing and pretax earnings guidance.","Our Employer Group Medicare Advantage business remained stable, and we expect net growth of about 20,000 members, which is the driver of the net $10 million increase related to membership shown on the slide. This $10 million is netted down slightly for an expected loss of 65,000 members in our commercial and Medicare ASO membership.","Looking now at our Health and Well-Being Segment. We expect pretax earnings to decline approximately $30 million to a range of $460 million to $510 million due to an anticipated $75 million or $0.30 per share of investments to continue to build our integrated care delivery infrastructure, as Bruce discussed. These investments include the following 6 types of expenditures: First, cash outlays of $300 million to $400 million to acquire physician practices and medical service organizations, primarily in 6 targeted geographies; second, first year operating losses incurred during the transition phase of these practices to risk-sharing partners; third, building new primary and chronic care centers through joint venture arrangements with our MSO partners; fourth, integration costs associated with consolidating to a common practice management platform; fifth, health care information technology costs associated with conductivity and electronic medical records; and finally, incremental local market infrastructure and marketing.","We have added approximately 50 primary care physicians and clinicians, as well as opened a dozen joint venture centers over the past year. This experience, combined with today's announced transactions, validates to us that now is the time to significantly accelerate and expand this buildout. Excluding the $75 million of 2013 investment spending, the remaining businesses in the Health and Well-Being Segment are expected to grow their combined pretax income by $45 million, led by our strong pharmacy business and our expanding home care capabilities. Finally, with respect to next year, we see our Other Businesses improving slightly over the year, as the beneficial effects from the non-recurrence of the second quarter TRICARE litigation settlement is partially offset by the first full year of the new TRICARE contract in 2013.","So in summary, when we put it all together, we see 2013 earnings per share within a range of $7.60 to $7.80, including the $0.30 per share of accelerated and expanding investments in our MSO and primary care capabilities, which will help us greatly over the long term in both positioning and profitability.","Finally, let's take a closer look at our consolidated operating cost ratio changes over the past 2 years. The continued successful implementation of our company's strategy has had an effect on the multiyear comparability of our consolidated operating cost ratio, which this slide outlines. Here are the details. First, in 2012, our consolidated operating cost ratio is expected to increase by 20 basis points over 2011. This is primarily the result of the net revenue accounting change for the new TRICARE contact effective April 1, 2012. And it's offset by the progress we've made toward lowering the operating cost ratio in our core Retail and Employer Group Segments, as well as our Health and Well-Being Services Segment. Looking forward to 2013, we expect this Retail and Employer Group operating cost ratio progress to continue. However, the investment in our MSO operations and the growth in our pharmacy business in the Health and Well-Being Segment, as well as first full year of the TRICARE net revenue accounting change, will continue to increase our consolidated operating cost ratio by the estimated 30 basis points shown on this slide.","Again, we're pleased with our results today and are confident of our prospects for the next year and beyond. Before turning the lines open for questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike McCallister.","Michael B. McCallister","Thanks, Jim. Before opening the phone lines for questions, I'd like to add my full endorsement of the integrated care delivery strategy that Bruce set forth in his remarks. It takes advantage of industry trends, it plays to our historic strengthen in Medicare and it opens up new and promising revenue streams for the enterprise. By partnering with physicians and giving them the data assets they need to offer our members quality, cost-effective care, I believe over the next few years that we'll not only grow the company, we'll also contribute meaningfully to improving our nation's fragmented, inefficient health care system.","Regina Nethery","Operator, we're now ready to start the queue. So if you could queue up the first caller. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first question, just on the acquisition\/investments of MetCare and then MCII (sic) [MCCI]. Can you talk a little bit about the potential impact of minimum MLR regulations, as well as how you see their relationships with other health plans progressing, the Coventrys, Uniteds, WellCares of the world?","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim Murray. The transactions that we talked about today and some of the investments that were spelled out are the right thing to do from a strategic perspective. And whatever happens down the road with respect to MLR requirements and rules and regulations, we'll deal with that as they come along. Some of the \u2013 the other question that I think that you asked is the relationship that we currently have through MetCare and MCCI, with those competitors that we do business with. And we're really pleased that the relationship exists. And I think folks from MetCare and MCCI are calling those competitors today to demonstrate that we would love to continue our relationship with them going forward. And that would be something that would be very important for us down the road.","Bruce D. Broussard","Josh, in regards to that also, we today, with our CAC centers, actually have some relationships with those competitors today. And I think it has been fruitful for them as a result of our capability and operations. And I would see that continuing in the acquisitions that we're talking about.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So sounds like, Jim Murray, just to clarify that, you don't have a sense necessarily whether or not there'll be an impact from the minimum MLRs. I mean, I'm just wondering is that -- does MetCare become a separate subsidiary? Is that part of your Florida MLR that you report on a consolidated basis theoretically? Or how's that going to work?","James E. Murray","Well, the current plan is for MetCare to be a separate subsidiary, and the results of our health plan business will flow up through Humana's results and MetCare's results will flow into our overall consolidated financial reporting. What happens ultimately with how the MLRs are required to be reported or included in our bids is something that has to be determined by CMS and we're waiting for guidance on all that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And are they all -- is that all included in the 2013 guidance? I know you said modestly accretive in the press release.","James E. Murray","The results of the acquisitions that we reported on today and the investments that we reported on are included in our 2013 guidance, net of any investments that we have to do to combine those into the company. But as we said, it's modestly accretive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You had an improvement in your Retail MLR. And I was hoping that you could talk about some of the drivers there, maybe parse out what was medical management on the new cohort versus what was the underlying trend.","James H. Bloem","Well, the amount -- there's been a stabilization of the second quarter when we talked about what the new member cohort are. So that those -- there is no change in what we had originally put forth there. We indicated in the second quarter that we had seen an increase in the MLR of the new cohorts. We had then projected that through the rest of the year. We've seen the real stabilization of that. So the improvement basically continues to be as the book continues to get better in the rest of the business, we indicated that we've had strong PDP results and that the rest of the business continues to perform just as we had originally envisioned it, both originally last year and in the second quarter.","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray again. The suggestion that I made earlier, obviously, MetCare has to close before it can be included in our guidance. When it does close, it would likely be modestly accretive as well as MCCI. So I apologize for that.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then looking into next year, the retail MLR guidance is flat. So can you talk about some of the assumptions going into that on the cost side or the pricing side?","James H. Bloem","Well, again, as we mentioned about our 2013 bids, as we said in the second quarter, we're very pleased with those. And as we've seen things develop, that's continued to be the case. So what we've seen in terms of the overall MLR, we're returning to our overall objective of a 5% pretax operating margin. And again, we've also taken into account the competitive positioning that we learned about in October.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question was just around the investment spend that you talked about last quarter. I believe it was $46 million of investments that you would look to drive $200 million to $300 million of potential either lower costs or higher risk scores. Can you give us an update on how that's been trending, whether you feel like you're still on track to get that $200 million to $300 million? And how much of that is included in this 5% margin guidance?","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray again. As Bruce reviewed in his prepared remarks, there's a significant investment that we're making in clinical resources, both in our market offices, as well as with our Humana Cares chronically ill capability, where we telephone our chronically ill seniors to help stabilize them in their homes. And so there's a lot of momentum that is developing as respects those 2 initiatives. And we feel very good about how those are playing themselves out. I think you also asked about whether or not the beneficial impact of those initiatives are going to likely be included in our result. And obviously, they are. But I don't want to be flippant. But like Prego, there's a lot of things that are included in our guidance for next year. You've got secular trends of anywhere from 4% to 6% depending on upon how that all plays itself out. Our trend vendors, when we did our bids, it was anywhere from 2% to 4%. And the more work that we do around investing in clinical resources makes us feel better that we're going to be on the higher end of those trend vendors. We also have MRA activities that we're doing. The recalibration is included in all of that, as well as some beneficial impact from the good work that we do with Stars, sequestration. And so yes, the good work that we described on all these clinical investments is included in our guidance. But there's a lot of other things, and we just have worked over the years, as you all know, to try to be as conservative as possible and do as much as we can so that we can come out sometime during 2013 and tell you about a lot of good stuff that's developing. And so I don't want to be evasive. But there's so many things that go into our guidance for 2013. The more we do around investment, the better we feel.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let me -- and maybe I could just ask it in a slightly more direct way, Jim. When you gave the bids, when you put in the bids, it was -- I think what you communicated was you felt like after what you saw in the second quarter, you were going to be -- you still had some good conservatism in the bids. And then this $200 million to $300 million was extra conservatism, call it, or more cushion to the bids. Has that changed? Or do you still feel the same way about your bids?","James E. Murray","As you -- many of you after the call were wondering whether or not we really got stuff into our bids, and then when you saw how it all played itself out in October, when CMS released a lot of that, there was a lot of write-ups that, in fact, we had caught a lot of the stuff that we had identified in the second quarter. So I feel good about the fact that our bids addressed many of the issues. And as I said earlier, we are constantly trying to improve the cost structure of our programs because right now, as you know, there's funding cuts that are being played out and the amount that we're getting from CMS is not very significant. And so the more we can do to invest in clinical programs and do the good things that we talked about around our strategy of integrated care delivery models, the better I feel about our ability to achieve the guidance that we just shared with you a moment ago. So I feel very good about where we're at going into 2013.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just ask a second question on cash flow. Can you just give us your thoughts on -- I saw you said you were going to finance the deals with cash and debt. Can you give us a total amount on what you need to do there? And can you talk about whether just why this wouldn't be mostly debt, given your debt-to-cap? And also just throw us what you think you'll be able to dividend up in the second quarter of next year, given this plan, that'd be really helpful.","James H. Bloem","Okay. Well, Justin, well, obviously, right now, we're going to stay with cash and debt because we don't know when it's going to close. We don't know how it's going to relate to when the dividends will be dividend-ed up above. But you're right. Our debt-to-cap has fallen below 16%. And so you can expect that debt will be a significant part of what we do. We haven't quite finalized all our plans yet because we want to see how it closes. We have the other 2 acquisitions as well. And then we'll probably look to package that up at some point. But we also have $1 billion line that's still available to us, too, that's unused.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what's the total number there, guys? What's the total number of spend for these 3 deals?","James H. Bloem","We didn't say. We did not disclose the terms on Certify and on MCCI. MetCare is $850 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just in terms of the enrollment guidance for next year, sort of the assumption of, I think you said organic 6% or so compared to kind of the CMS estimate of 11% for overall MA. So I guess, just your thoughts on sort of being below kind of the average? And maybe talk about what you're seeing in the open enrollment season right now, whether that is or isn't impacting that estimate.","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray again. I'm not sure how CMS calculated what they calculated. We looked at a market-by-market evaluation of where we were relative to the competitors and how much we thought we could sell with the benefits in premiums as we filed them with the government. I will tell you that for 2013 that we're probably -- if we sold 480,000 in 2012, we're currently estimating selling about 450,000 this coming year. And we have a termination estimate that is somewhere around 320,000 versus the 260,000 that we are seeing for 2012. And so that's about 100,000 delta, which kind of comports with the growth that we're going to see this year of about 220,000 or thereabouts. In the first couple of weeks, we've been dealing with hurricanes and we've been dealing with presidential elections. But I feel pretty good about the guidance that we put out there, not only for our MAPD growth but also the PDP business. Lots of stuff will take place over the next couple of weeks, but I feel cautiously optimistic with the targets that we've established.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my second question, one of the must-haves -- and you've talked about growing the dual-eligible business. I guess, do you believe you sort of have the capabilities in place? Or should we expect sort of you to look at expanding that platform and\/or incremental investment spend for the duals? And then is there anything in guidance for the Ohio duals for '13?","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, as Jim was outlining, we really don't break out outside of membership growth relative to what's in there on the dual side. So I can't answer that question. In regards to our capabilities overall in the dual-eligible aspect, we feel today our relationship with CareSource and our current internal capabilities, along with our contracted capabilities, should serve us well for the coming years. As you articulated, we've had success in Ohio. We've had some success here in Kentucky. And we also are in active bidding progress in the other states there. And it doesn't give us any inclination that we will not be successful in the other states there. So we're going to continue on our strategy of internal build along with the partnership with CareSource.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a sense of prior period development? Was there any prior period development related to prior quarters? And also, in your bid, you said that you assumed kind of a 4% to 6% trend. Where did that come in, in 2012? And what are you assuming in 2013 for the Medicare Advantage medical trend? And then the 2% to 4% trend vendor that you're assuming for '13, you said that you expect that to be kind of at the higher end. What was it in 2012? What was the trend vendor worth this year?","James H. Bloem","Let's start with -- what was it? Prior period development versus prior -- in the quarter versus the year. All of the prior period development was prior year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So there was no prior quarter development?","James H. Bloem","Very tiny amount.","James E. Murray","Yes. You asked some questions about the bids and secular trends. And we put out guidance at around 4% to 6%. And philosophically, I guess you could guess that we generally see around a 5% trend as we look way back. And so that's philosophically where we're seeing trends come in on a regular basis. And in terms of trend vendors and stepping back even a bit more, that -- we do many, many, many bids. And so we do market-based bids, and so the secular trends that we may use may be different in Omaha that they are in Florida. And the same goes with the trend vendors. A lot of the work that we do has to be market-based. I said earlier that our trend vendor work is somewhere between 2% and 4%. And we generally feel pretty good about the way that we achieve that. We have a whole team of actuaries that study our trend vendors. And we constantly are adding to those trend vendors and people are making sure that we're honest with ourselves. We've got to hit a track record of being -- of beating those going forward, and that's some of the dialogue that we had earlier in my remarks. So we'll see how that all plays out. But again, I feel very good going into 2013.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And where do you think the trend vendors came out in 2012?","James E. Murray","I'm sorry, help me with that. I didn't...","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Are you \u2013 I think it's like 2%, 4%, 5%, 1%?","James E. Murray","The trend vendors are coming out pretty much right now that we're in November. So they'll play themselves out for the remainder of the year and we'll even see the trend vendors final themselves out in the first quarter of next year. So they're right on target right now. And I would guess that as we close out stuff in the first and second quarter of next year, we'll probably see some amount above next year. A little bit.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you expect 2012 to evolve at something over 4%?","James E. Murray","Well, again, I think 2% to 4% because -- or something in the middle, so...","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. So you're looking for roughly an equivalent amount of trend vendors next year versus this?","James E. Murray","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go into the deal for Met Health today. I guess, you made some comments earlier about initiatives to invest more in physician groups. And I think I understand those investments a little bit better than I do the Met Health one because if you're going to buy physician groups in markets where trying to build out a network, that makes some sense to me, but to buy a physician group, where you're already -- they already are your network, trying to understand what the incremental value add to Humana was from doing that. Are you going to be able to expand them faster than they would on their own? Or were you afraid that their recent deal kind of expanding into different payors was going to dilute your influence on them? I mean, what was the rationale there? Because it seems different to me than what you're talking about into these other new markets?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, really a combination a few things. First it is a platform organization for us in continuing to expand our MSO capabilities. And so we look at that as the ability to take it and grow it in other markets, as we actually have been successful with other relationships, where we've been able to make investments and then grow them in other markets. But this particular case, it allows us as take their platform and also operationalize it. And so we look at that being the most important reason for the acquisition. And so when we talk about 300 to 400 additional physicians, it will be built on that platform from an MSO point of view and using the Concentra platform from an ability to manage the physician side.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So then I guess, how do you guys think about owning versus contracting and networking? What are the benefits that you get? Obviously, you're putting capital out there to align with the physicians when you buy them. What are you getting when you do that, that you're not getting with just a pure capitation arrangement?","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, a few things. I think, first, obviously, you now have another source of revenue as a result of that, so not only from an insurance point of view, but now also from an ability to earn on the MSO side. So there's an earnings aspect of that. The second aspect is also we are then able to have a platform that we can expand, where currently we do not have partners in those particular marketplaces. And as we look at an integrated care model long term, it has the most effect on cost of care, the quality of care, and in addition, from an experience point of view. And our objective is to grow that throughout the nation, and we want to align with partners and have the platform to be able to grow that. And that's what you see really behind the investments both in acquisition of MetCare but in addition, our investments in our joint ventures.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just to wrap this up, if I can. The other investments you talked about on the physician side, it sounded like there was some initial start-up losses as you moved from -- their business from maybe some future service towards a risk-based aspect of things. As far as Met Health goes, they're pretty much already kind of along that spectrum. So trying to think about your comment about modestly accretive next year, is there a ramp-up to that as well for that deal? Or is that growth going to be largely about you expanding them into new markets and using that as a platform for growth?","James E. Murray","With MetCare, once it ultimately closes, there's integration costs as we've evaluated there; IT capabilities, putting their current duplicative IT capabilities together, will have some cost for us as an organization. We also detailed the acquisition of Certify, which is bringing together the various providers in the network that we establish. And some of the costs related to doing that relative to the MetCare acquisition is included in that. And so if you look at MetCare's profitability and you reduce some IT cost spend, some MSO capability spend that Bruce detailed, as well as putting together a lot of the asset, the transaction costs that we want to do with Certify and what-have-you, it comes out to a number that's modestly accretive going forward. But again, it has to close first.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But then those costs start to go away in '14, et cetera, and it would ramp up there?","James E. Murray","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the first question is about your employer MLR. You've guided a 100 bps duration year-over-year. And I understand the Group Medicare product is -- usually have worst MLR. In terms of the commercial side of the book, what assumptions do you have in there for the pricing and the medical cost trend? Some of your competition are not talking and the channel checks would indicate that the excise tax is being loaded into pricing for commercial in '13. Are you baking that in? And are you planning to do that as well?","James H. Bloem","Actually, our assumptions with respect to commercial group, are very similar to what they were at this time last year and actually what they were this time 2 years ago. So you look at the 5 component of trend, those are really all in the same brackets that they've been in. And so we're thinking that probably have about a 5% trend this year. So 150 basis points takes us somewhere, plus or minus 50 basis points, takes us somewhere between 6% and 6.5%. And again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we haven't seen this eventual uptick in trend, but we still continue to price and guide for it.","James E. Murray","As related to your excise tax question, it is our intent to build that into our pricing for not only our commercial business but also our Medicare business going forward.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But continuing on that vein, on the Medicare business for 2014, your Star ratings came out very nicely for '12 and projected into '14. As you're thinking about loading the premium taxes, the impacts of the loss ratio floors, particularly the controversy in Florida and reform-related budget reductions, are your target margins for Medicare 5% on the medium and long term? Do you think you can do that?","James E. Murray","Yes. And a lot of that 15% solution and now this new strategy that Bruce laid out relative to the integrated care delivery model will help us to continue to target that 5% going forward.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then you might have said this to Sarah's question earlier, but you had quite a bit of an uptick in 2Q. And you attributed it to aging Baby Boomers, possibly lower risk scores, maybe adverse selection, given your plan designs. So you have now 1 quarter of data. What specifically got better here for you from -- obviously, it wasn't pricing because you've already baked in your product for this year.","James E. Murray","Yes. Since we reported out in the second quarter, there's been a lot of work that we've continued to do and we've had smaller ahas. We identified some distribution channel issues with one of our partners that was selling to a block of business that got us more than our fair share of risk. I will tell you that I'm not certain that there's a silver bullet. There's a lot of things that kind of came together. And I guess, I might call it a perfect storm. We were a little bit more aggressive than we had been in our 2012 bids. We had the new member growth that resulted from that. And as we've tried to detail last quarter, new members carry a higher medical expense ratio. So if you had more of those, it impacts you negatively. I also might suggest that some of the issue that we had was going into new geographies and not really having the clinical programs in place to address some of those that is why we're doing so much to build some of those clinical capabilities that Bruce detailed. The outpatient issue was pretty severe in the first quarter. We're seeing that slow down quite a bit in the second and third quarters. And then we also talked about that messaging issue, where we were messaging folks to do the preventative work, and that's playing itself out. And I think that will ultimately help us in the long term. So a lot of things came together to create what we reported in the second quarter. We're seeing some modulation of those as we go into the third and fourth. And I feel good about a lot of what we're building from a clinical perspective to deal with those in 2013.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Then finally on 2013 itself, you had the 15% solution. There was a lot of confidence around that. You were pricing trend vendors into the product itself. I think you talked about NPV-based pricing on lifetime value of a member. Now given that you had some issues in that 15% solution and it's not yet fully reproducible, if you will, and you're shifting your mix into HMOs, are you planning to have a more conservative plan design? And is that what you have in 2013? So just tying it back to the 5% target for 2014 and beyond sustainable, has 2013 and your 5% guidance here baked in some conservatism?","James E. Murray","Well, we'll see how it all ultimately plays itself out. We can tell you right now 5%. The one thing that I will tell is that our bids addressed the members that we had at that point in time. And the other positive thing that I shared with you in the second quarter but we need to see how this plays out is as it respects the new members that we're going to get this year, I believe our benefit designs are tighter than they had been in 2012. And so the new member targets that we shared with you last year, I think, are going to go down, which will also provide a positive going into 2013. But again, we'll see how this all plays out. There are so many variables and assumptions. But I feel very good about where we sit for us going into 2013, particularly with some of the clinical investment that we're making, and now this new investment in the integrated delivery model that we feel so good about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the description of the spending in the second quarter clinical infrastructure investments versus integrated care delivery model spending that you're talking about now. Was the $46 million at 2Q and the $75 million you're talking for 2013, are those sort of completely distinct discretionary spending items? Or are they broadly the same?","James E. Murray","They're very different. The spend that we've made during 2012 is to support and buttress our ability to manage and care for folks in the markets that have acute events, as well as chronic events. Some of the spending that we detailed for this year related to the chronically ill. The investment that we're talking about for next year is to acquire primary care physicians and to build integrated care delivery models, which as we've explained in the past are so much better in terms of controlling variability and managing our members in a more holistic approach. And so totally different spending items.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then \u2013 so the $46 million from the second half of this year, when I look at the EPS roll-forward for 2013, is that being normalized somewhere? Is it in the operating margins? Can you just give us some color on that?","James H. Bloem","Well, I think Jim answered the question before in terms of looking at where we've been and where we're going. In terms of that $46 million, we've pretty much stayed on the schedule that we've set for ourselves in terms of implementing and hiring the clinicians and doing the things it takes to take care of the acutely ill to get their scores correct. And so again, I feel like we've done with that what we've set out to do for that piece of it. Then as we go forward, we said ultimately, we do hope to get that ROI that was mentioned. We did say though that there's many things that go into 2013 guidance, and this is just but one of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question relates to the Health and Well-Being Segment. You're projecting revenue growth of going from just north of $13 billion to just under $18 billion, looks like a lot of that is intercompany. You're doubling down sort of on your expenditures on the doc businesses with your purchase of MDF at a multiple that's higher than your current stock trades at, much higher. And we're not looking at business that's growing earnings year-to-year. Can you tell us when we're going to see the earnings growth in that business year-to-year?","James H. Bloem","Well, I think as Bruce indicated and as Jim indicated, these expenditures are really designed to give us broadened capability, to take the capabilities that these 2 entities have and to move them across all the places where we want to have the kind of network build and the kind of clinical capabilities that we want. So I think that, that's the real -- the real issue is in and of itself, it is going to be accretive, as we said modestly in the first year, and then it'll pick up as we go. But the real accretion and the real benefit from it comes from the fact that over time, we'll operationalize this in many different places, the capabilities that these 2, the 1, the joint venture, and the other, the acquisition, bring us.","James E. Murray","In the schedule that you may be looking at, you may be noticing that the entire $75 million investment that we're detailing here today is included in the Health and Well-Being Segment. And all of that will be paid back within a 2-year timeframe. And so we feel very good about the payback that will create itself as a result of spending that $75 million. And when we said modestly accretive related to MCCI and MetCare, what impacts that negatively in the first year or so is a lot of integration cost, which ultimately as somebody asked or pointed out, go away, and so that will then begin to demonstrate itself in years '14 and '15. So we feel very good about the acquisitions that we're talking about.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I understand that. But with the business as a whole, first we had Concentra, and then we had integration costs on that. Now we've got MDF and integration costs on that. When are we going to see the business as a whole not have these integration cost drags going on the earnings so that we actually get, from a shareholder perspective, earnings per share growth from that business?","James H. Bloem","Okay. Well, Peter, I think that, again, when you take the capability plays that we got with both of these acquisitions, starting with Concentra, the many locations, the 350 locations and the ability to really move to more of a primary care physician acquisition strategy than they had, they represent very good value. Now you're right. We've reinvested the earnings that we've had from these acquisitions. So if we'd have done nothing but continue to do with them what they did without us before, then we would have some of that and we would've had some of the earnings that you're talking about already. But what we need to do as we go forward and why we've elected to do this as rapidly as we are and as quickly as we are is because we see that it's very important in gaining control of health care cost and improving our consumer experience that we get this done in the timeframe that's still really is around before 2014 and beyond. And that way, having those capabilities when that time period arises, will be of great strategic value and economic value to us.","Bruce D. Broussard","Peter, I think just to maybe put it into some of the same context that Jim was referring to, we are balancing the need to continue to grow the organization, and from a shareholder point of view and provide the adequate return. I think as you look over the years, there has been pretty impressive growth in the organization. Has not been driven largely by just buying companies to get from size, we've been very oriented to focusing on how we can advance our strategic aspect while still growing organically. And when you look at the organization and where we're positioning itself, there are significant changes that are going on in health care over the coming years. And we believe that the acquisitions that we are doing today, not only position us in the short run from a financial point of view but position us in a long run of being able to be a leader in dealing with those changes, and most importantly, to be able to drive down the health care costs. And that we continue to focus on that. And these acquisitions that we've added here, the Concentra acquisition wrapped around a primary care aspect, our investments in Anvita and our investments in SeniorBridge are all examples of where we are focused on building a system that long term will deal with and have a competitive advantage as opposed to just short term relative to meeting accretion or dilution tests.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up question regarding the margins in that business, even without the $75 million of extra spending. Can you talk about why the margin pressure is there without that relative to the revenue rise in that business? And I understand it's probably intercompany revenues. But please talk about the intercompany revenues and the transfer pricing effect of the margin pressure.","James H. Bloem","Well, the margins in the Health and Well-Being Segment, I think, will be better. The only thing that's holding them down, there's a little slide in my presentation at the end, where you can kind of look at that. But if you look at the 2-year totals of what we're looking at, you can see that we continue to drive down the operating cost ratios in the core businesses, the Retail and the Employer Group. And that's going down by 150 basis points as shown there. Now 140 basis points of that 150 basis points comes right back as we change the accounting for TRICARE. But then come back over to the Health and Well-Being, the only reason that has increased by 60 is the 75 spend. And to come back to your first question, when we decide how much we're going to pay for these, we look at the capability we're buying and what that cost versus what would be the time and the money and the cost of doing that on our own. And it's that speed that we think that justifies the higher premiums. And then continuing to work down the cost on the operating cost part and take that capability and use that to do that, to continue to drive that cost down, that's where we can improve our own multiple to get more in line with the multiples we pay for the things we buy. We're very careful about how much money we pay when we look at -- and we look at all of our alternatives to get these capabilities.","James E. Murray","Just not to belabor this, but one more item. I think if you look at the PBM margins that exist out in the marketplace, that the margins there are pretty similar to what we're booking as a company. And right now, our Health and Well-Being Segment is comprised significantly of our PBM activities and operations. The Concentra platform was acquired a number of years ago to fill out this strategy that we're now laying out there. The margins that it's enjoying for its urgent care and occupational medicine business have been on the lower end. But we ultimately see as we're acquiring primary care physicians and putting them on the Concentra platform that the margins that they'll enjoy will begin to go up over time. And so I think you'll see some nice growth in the margins from our Health and Well-Being Segment, as we move more and more into this primary care and the delivery of care that Bruce laid out earlier.","James H. Bloem","And you can certainly see that in the dollar profit earned by Health and Well-Being.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","On your commentary around prior year development, I'm wondering if that came from parts of your membership apart from the new member cohorts that you talked about at length on the 2Q. So said differently, does the prior year development change your thought process about those new cohort cost trends?","James H. Bloem","No, David, it doesn't. Again, prior year development came from generally the prior year. And again, we had -- as we indicated second quarter, we had some of these numbers, but that was a minority part, a very small part of what the prior year development was about.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you had talked on 2Q I think, and maybe you said this and I couldn't hear it. But you had talked on 2Q not only about 2012 new members but also 2011 new members not performing very well. And I just wondered if the prior year development had anything to do with those 2011 new members. It sounds like no.","James E. Murray","Yes. The 2011 new members that we detailed on the second quarter call have improved since we showed you the slide that we showed you on the second quarter. But it occurred as a result of this year's improvement. And so feel very good about how 2011 is starting to turn itself out, and now we look to 2012 to do the same.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of your plan expansions, Jim, to Ana's \u2013 one of Ana's questions, you talked about not having some medical management capabilities in places, one of the reasons that perhaps that performance was not as good in new member cohorts. You also saw that, I believe, in PPO plans. So in 2013, you're growing your PPO plan number by something like 23%. Does the investment that you're putting in place today address that medical management need in those new plan markets? Or are you depending on benefit design to address the issue? Or if you could detail that for me, I'd appreciate it.","James E. Murray","Yes. As I detailed earlier, a lot of the spend that we're making by hiring nurses in markets, as well as hiring nurses for Humana Cares allows us to address those new geographies that are included in 2013. And as well as the plan designs that I referenced earlier will also address the issue for 2013. So all of those coming together will help us with our 2013 results.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You recently announced entry into Region 3 of Kentucky, a state where Medicaid has proven pretty challenging this year. Can you talk about your comfort with the profitability in that region, especially given the financial arrangements you have with your partner? And then also given Centene's announced exit, do you have an appetite to expand more broadly across the state, longer term?","James E. Murray","Sure. CareSource is responsible for the losses on the Kentucky relationship that we established up to some stop-loss level, which is fairly high. As it relates to some of the other things that are going on in Kentucky, you see a lot of bad results from some of our competitors, and obviously, some of the contractual content that would have to change before we would be interested. But we'd always be interested in moving into various parts of that business. But again, the contract would have to be amended. Apparently, the cost assumptions were probably inappropriate.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I know you talked a bit about the duals in response on earlier question. But these 6 key markets where you're making the investments in integrated care models, are they at all aligned with markets where you potentially see long-term opportunities with the duals?","James E. Murray","Yes. One of the things that Bruce Broussard highlighted was investing in as many as 15 primary care or chronic care capabilities with a joint venture partner who specializes in focusing on the dual-eligible population. And so we feel very good about the opportunity there, particularly in these fixed markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Coffina with Morningstar.","Matthew Coffina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","It seems to me like you guys are pushing more into the vertically integrated model than any of your peers. And it also seems like that's a model that will work best when you have a high level of geographic concentration. So my question is, is this only a build strategy? Or at some point, do you also have to look to divest some assets, particularly geographically to focus on maybe fewer markets with more scale?","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, first, your point is right is that we are oriented to a vertical integration wrapped around integrated care model. So that, we'll confirm. In regards to the markets, we are oriented to geographic concentration because we do find that, that geographic concentration allows us to invest in the markets and be able to achieve the most efficient health care delivery. In regards to divesting and your specific question around that, we are constantly looking at markets and figuring out if they are the most effective market for us to be in. And so you don't see a lot of assets that we would be selling. There might be times that we might exit a market, but that has less of a financial implication because we don't have a lot of assets in those marketplaces. It's more relative to just leaving the market there.","Matthew Coffina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So is there any kind of characterization you could give us in terms of the percent of your current membership that could be viable within an integrated model? And then at the same time, maybe looking 5 or 10 years out, what percent of care delivery could potentially be delivered internally versus using third parties?","Bruce D. Broussard","Right now, about more than 30% or so is in our relationships that we have and what we call risk-bearing relationships. We would see that being between 1\/3 and 1\/2 of our population would be in those members going forward. And so not only will we be growing the HMO product or the integrated care product, we will also be growing the PPO product. So we'll continue to support that product, but our primary focus will also be moving members into the integrated delivery system over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the assumption that you had for the loss in the individual One members in the back half of the year. It looks like you're assuming maybe around 10% of the individual book will come off ahead of 2014. You talked a little bit about some of the assumptions that you put into that, sort of how you're arriving at that type of contraction. And then what would you expect in 2014 with the legacy individual book? Would you expect that to then move down more significantly as the changes come up online?","James H. Bloem","Well, to start with, the 45,000 that we mentioned is basically, again, just talking about in the second half of the year, people begin to await the exchanges. And as you know, the individual business is more ratable, it comes during the year. So you'll get -- you have more and more people -- you have more people come in during the year as opposed to at the beginning or in the middle. So we wouldn't be in a position right now to tell you about 2014, but we think it's quite reasonable to assume that as 2014 approaches and the health insurance exchanges, the regulations come out and people know what they are that they'll start to be able to look at that in addition to the coverage they now have. So we think that fewer people will be buying coverage in the current marketplace and more will be looking for that January 1 start date.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just how much of that also would be influenced by pricing and what you'll need to do there on the individual book? Maybe there's been a lot of talk about sort of the group plans and how pricing could be impacted as the tax starts to roll through, throughout the course of '13. Maybe just spiking out individual as you think about things like the tax, and then also how the risk profile of the individual market can change as you see members potentially dropping out ahead of the exchanges and how you price for that.","James E. Murray","The individual business for us is currently about a breakeven proposition. In terms of the revenues that we enjoy as a company, think it's less than $1 billion compared with $25 billion from the MA business. We see that there's an opportunity for the individual business in 2014 as we go into certain states where we think it makes good sense to do that. But in terms of how the individual business is going to move the dial at Humana, it's probably a smaller part of our overall thinking as an organization. We're cautiously optimistic that we're building the right mechanisms and what-have-you to compete on a selective basis in 2014 after we see how that all plays out. But it's not a significant area of focus for us as an organization going forward.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So 3 weeks into open enrollment, be interested in what has surprised you the most from the competitors in both MA and PDP, whether it's benefit design, change in distribution. Anything else you'd highlight?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray again. The only thing that I would say that has surprised us is the lower pricing on the PDP business by one of our competitors. Other than that, some of the -- each market stands on its own. You see some stuff in a particular market that is surprising in terms of the premium or the benefit design. Those all seem to balance themselves out on the MAPD business, and so that's why we feel reasonably confident with our 125,000 net growth number. So the only thing that I was a little surprised about was what happened on the PDP business. And we'll see how that plays itself out.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the second question, just on the cash at the parent, fell sequentially $760 million, between the dividend, the deals, repurchasing, get to about $485 million. Just be interested in what was the other $275 million change there.","James H. Bloem","Yes. Carl, I saw your question. And we normally put a little sentence in the press release that says, \"The difference is working capital changes.\" And that's what it was this time. And principally, of that $270 million, it's about $230 million was income taxes. The parent pays the income taxes for all the subsidiaries, and then eventually gets reimbursed by them. So that's the difference.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I hand the program back over to Mr. Mike McCallister for closing remarks.","Michael B. McCallister","Thank you. Let me just remind everyone about the strategic decisions the company has made over the last dozen years. We were the company, I think, that best recognized the opportunity that Medicare Modernization Act meant in 2003 and has transformed our company. We're, I think, one of the early companies to really understand that this business was moving to retail and to consumers, especially in the Medicare space and potentially in the commercial space as well. We've got the strategic implications of an Affordable Care Act. We have a really rapidly evolving, real-time information environment. And you've seen an acquisition this morning from us that feeds into that. There is rapid provider consolidation throughout the country. And you've seen some action this morning down that path.","But I think at the end of the day, the strategic implications in front of us here today, and I think what you should take away from this call and what you've heard this morning is that we are completely convinced that integrated health care, as far and as fast as we can take it is critical to the next chapter of what happens, especially in the Medicare business but potentially for the entire business. And so you're going to continue to see us work very quickly down that path. The future is about integrated health, it's about population health and it's about payment for quality. And I think Humana's set itself up today, in the midterm and in the long term to be able to deal with all of that.","And with that, Bruce and I will thank you for joining us. I also want to thank the Humana associates that are on the call today for making both this quarter's results what they were and setting us up for a great future. Thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Ms. Regina Nethery, you may begin your conference.","Regina Nethery","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Humana's senior management team will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and our updated earnings outlook for 2014. Participating in today's prepared remarks will be Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve McCulley, interim Chief Financial Officer. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Joining Bruce and Steve for the Q&A session will be Jim Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts.

This call is also being simulcast via the Internet along with a virtual slide presentation. For those of you who have company firewall issues and cannot access the live presentation, an Adobe version of the slides has been posted to the Investor Relations section of Humana's website.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Finally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2013 results for our business segments that were in line with or slightly better than our previous expectations. Although we continue to have confidence in our 2014 earnings projection given the strength of our integrated care delivery model and better-than-expected Medicare membership growth, continued growth in 2015 and beyond will be driven by the degree of headwinds presented by public policies surrounding government programs.","The fourth quarter 2013 loss of $0.19 per share disclosed in this morning's press release was predominantly driven by a $0.99 per share expenses for reserve strengthening on our nonstrategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies. Steve McCulley will speak to this in his remarks. However, I would like to also note that this was primarily a noncash charge, which is expected to have little impact on our free cash flow expectations moving forward.","Over the past year, we've been focused on optimizing our capital deployment around assets that are an integral part of our strategy. This has resulted in our exit of a number of nonmaterial, nonstrategic businesses and products. This closed block of long-term care insurance policies certainly has no correlation to our strategy. Thus, we are evaluating our strategic alternatives for this asset.","This morning, we also reiterated our forecast for 2014 earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.75. As you will recall from last quarter's discussion, the breadth of that range is designed to incorporate flexibility, given the tumultuous environment in which we are operating this year. While we are comfortable with how the many variables are beginning to play out, we are only 36 days into the year, far too early to refine our guidance.","My comments this morning will focus on some of the more significant variables impacting our environment, specifically our results from the Medicare Annual Election Period, what we are seeing thus far with our health care exchange offerings and our capacity to address the additional Medicare rate pressure we are expecting for 2015.","Now let me begin with our results from the Medicare Annual Election Period. As we indicated in our recent public disclosure, gross sales were meaningfully higher than we had projected and terminations were lower than expected for our Medicare Advantage and standalone PDP offerings. We believe these better-than-anticipated results were primarily driven by the stability our members were able to see in our value proposition and provider networks from year-to-year. As a result, we now expect our combined individual and group Medicare Advantage business net growth to be in the range of 370,000 to 410,000 members during 2014. We've also revised our standalone PDP membership expectations to reflect projected net growth of 450,000 to 500,000 members. We feel confident in our ability to enroll these new members into the proper clinical programs more quickly and effectively than ever before. This is because of a favorable shift in the sources of our new Medicare Advantage members along with the increasing maturity of our clinical programs.","Let me provide you details on each of these items. Approximately 54% of our new members were from Medicare Advantage competitors, up from 42% in the prior year and 39% in 2012. Members transferring from other MA plans are likely to already be enrolled in clinical programs, allowing for faster and more accurate coding of their clinical conditions. This is a significant advantage to our members as it expedites the identification, documentation and enrollment of our members into our clinical programs, reducing the time between enrollment and clinical management.","In addition, approximately 64% of our net membership growth is in HMO plans and 33% of the new members are in risk relationships. Members in these relationships select a primary care physician during enrollment, ensuring the member receives timely preventative services, as well as chronic management identification, combined with proper documentation that facilitates clinical programs outside the physician office.","As I've described in recent earnings calls, our process for identifying members in need of clinical intervention has progressed substantially over the past 2 years. Now we are more proactive and have substantially accelerated identification and outreach processes, as well as enhanced our predictive modeling capabilities.","This slide indicates some of the more significant changes we have made to focus on wellness more broadly. The integrated delivery model helps ensure the trend vendor programs inherent in our 15% solution are implemented in a holistic fashion. Our strategic focus on helping providers increase their engagement through risk and path-to-risk arrangements also helps further our members' holistic consumer experience. We expect all of this will improve the related benefit to our members' wellness and further lower health care costs.","As this next slide shows, the efforts have come together to produce a significant increase in the number of new members in the Humana Chronic Care Program, or HCCP. At the end of 2013, total HCCP membership was more than 280,000, up from 151,000 at the end of 2012. We believe we can further increase that number to approximately 350,000 by the end of this year. I share this background to support our belief that a higher-than-expected Medicare membership is an even more positive development than it would have been in the past few years. When our early identification and related chronic programs were less mature, it impacted fewer members than they do today. We believe it is prudent to watch and see how this continues to play out as the year progresses, but are cautiously optimistic about the uptake we are seeing thus far.","Turning now to a discussion around our health care exchange offerings. The shifting rules and administrative process changes have made enrollment and earnings predictions all the more complex. We, and likely many of our competitors, are seeing much higher retention in our lower premium, non-ACA-compliant plans. This is due to the late-year announcement by HHS, which expanded participation in non-ACA-compliant plans to individuals across the country. We believe this change will result in an overall deterioration of the risk pool in ACA-compliant plans as more previously underwritten members have stayed with their current carriers rather than enter the exchanges.","This slide shows the distribution of our membership by metal tier, as well as the composition of our weekly sales activity. As you all know, our metal tier membership continues to shift as the open enrollment period goes on. Although the percentage of enrollees selecting higher metal tier plans in the first month was greater than we anticipated with the 2 additional months of enrollment remaining, we estimate the final enrollment mix will more closely to what we anticipated in our pricing.","While still early, as we analyze the demographics of our exchange membership, we are seeing enrollees skewing a bit more to the younger side. This is likely the result of premium-subsidized younger enrollees choosing the lower deductibles offered with the higher metal tier plans. Approximately 82% of our new members are receiving subsidies. This could potentially mitigate some of the adverse impact associated with the risk pool deterioration from our higher membership in non-ACA-compliant plans.","We believe we will still be within the broad range for health care exchanges that we included in our 2014 guidance, even considering the impact of the developments I described a moment ago and taking into account our smaller scale and higher customer service costs. Nonetheless, we will be watching carefully during the remaining enrollment period and initial claims experience.","The final topic I'd speak to this morning involves the challenges we are continuing to face in Washington regarding sustainable funding for the Medicare Advantage program. We anticipate an initial rate announcement on February 21, that would lower our funding by 6% to 7% in 2015. This incorporates the latest trend data from CMS, previously announced statutory and regulatory adjustments and the impact of the insurance industry fee.","During the 2014 annual enrollment period, the industry experienced some disruptions as some of our competitors were forced to lower benefits, exit markets and adjust their provider networks. As a result of the success of our 15% solution, we were able to provide stability to the marketplace for 2014. However, the anticipated 2015 rate reduction, combined with the cumulative historical reductions, could potentially require us to follow our competitors' adverse actions of cutting benefits and exiting markets. This could be disruptive to the program, ultimately reversing some of the program's success in care management, improved outcomes and value-based payments leading to lower costs.","In closing, our 2013 financial and operating results demonstrate the strength of our integrated care delivery model. We remain confident in this strategy as shown by reaffirming the 2014 EPS projections we shared with you today. We remain dedicated to continuing to improve the health outcomes for the millions of people we serve.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve McCulley to review our financial results and capital positioning.","Steven E. McCulley","Thanks, Bruce. Looking first at our results for 2013 and excluding the reserve strengthening detailed in our press release and that I will discuss shortly, we are pleased with our solid underlying operating earnings, which were slightly above the midpoint of our previous 2013 earnings guidance range. As you can see from the slide, Employer Group and Healthcare Services pretax income slightly exceeded the top of our guidance ranges, while retail pretax was within its guidance range.","Looking at the full year, we are very pleased that we achieved strong double-digit earnings growth across each of our business segments. Our retail segment benefited from membership growth of approximately 7% in both its individual Medicare Advantage and standalone PDP businesses, along with an improved operating cost ratio for the year.","Improvement in our Employer Group segment also reflected higher group Medicare Advantage membership, along with full year improvements in both benefit and operating cost ratios. Finally, higher health care services earnings reflected continued growth in our pharmacy business, a full year of earnings contribution from the Metropolitan Health Networks acquisition on December 21, 2012, and our growing home care services business, which were partially offset by planned investment spending associated with our expanding of our primary care footprint.","To summarize 2013, we are pleased with the strong underlying performance of our strategic businesses and believe that our progress in 2013 positions us well as we move into 2014 and beyond.","Turning next to the strengthening of reserves on our closed block of long-term care insurance policies. We increased these reserves by $243 million, or $0.99 per share during the quarter. This amount is net of approximately $100 million of reinsurance on these policies. As indicated on the slide, the principal driver of the charge was increased longevity and persistency versus our previous assumptions, which totaled $127 million. Having first been sold in the mid-1990s, this closed block of long-term care policies is a relatively immature product and we have a very limited amount of data -- or a very limited amount of our own credible experience, so we use industry data and actuarial tables to set our reserve assumptions. After evaluating emerging industry data and performing a very detailed review of our own experience, we applied recently updated actuarial mortality tables to our current policyholder base, which produced a higher estimate of future expenses. This factor is essentially driven by the increased life expectancy in the United States, combined with the decline in health status of Americans as they age.","Accordingly, the average number of years that a person is expected to live with at least one disability has increased markedly in the past 20 years. This specific issue impacts all issuers of long-term care insurance in the United States and is not unique to Humana.","Additionally, we have observed an increase in the use of home health care benefits by our policyholders since we last reset our policy reserves in 2010. At that time, our home health care claim experience and the actuarial morbidity tables that we were using aligned well. During 2012, we began to experience a higher level of home health care utilization than before. As a result, we strengthened our claim reserves for policyholders on claim by $33 million at the end of 2012.","Over the course of the 2013, we performed a very extensive analysis on our claims in connection with our annual fourth quarter reserve evaluation. This analysis was performed at a much more granular level as we reorganized our data to align with the implementation of new data modeling capabilities. As we modeled our higher level of home health care experience relative to the most current morbidity tables, we concluded that a subset of our policies were driving the majority of the variance, primarily as a result of a richer level of home health benefits than the industry norm.","Accordingly, we were able to isolate this issue and quantify the expected impact over the life of these policies, which resulted in the $72 million of additional reserves for future policy benefits. The third factor and remaining $44 million is driven primarily by the lower interest rate environment as we lowered our outlook modestly versus our prior assumptions. It is important to note that this charge is expected to have no impact on run rate current cash due primarily to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards in this insurance subsidiary. IRS tax rules restricted us from deducting operating losses or capital losses from this subsidiary and our consolidated tax returns for 5 years from the date of acquisition. As a result, we were able to utilize cumulative carryforward tax losses for the first time in our 2013 tax return, which generated an additional $161 million of surplus in the insurance subsidiary.","When combined with the existing level of capital in this entity, including a $40 million capital contribution we made during the fourth quarter, we believe that this subsidiary is positioned with a strong balance sheet heading into 2014 and beyond.","So in summary, we believe the exhaustive evaluation of this closed block of policies that we performed as part of our year-end closing process, combined with the strength in statutory balance sheet, positions this asset favorable going forward.","I will note that there has been some limited transaction interest and activity in this space in the past couple of years, and we're certainly evaluating strategic alternatives for this asset, as this business has no bearing on our core operations. That said, we are very comfortable with the valuation of this asset and how it is positioned going forward so we can be disciplined in these strategic evaluations.","Turning to our expected 2014 quarterly earnings pattern. This slide shows the timing of the major items that we expect to impact our earnings from quarter-to-quarter. These items include the annually discussed seasonal factors. Most of you are familiar with these individual quarterly impacts. While we do not expect our quarterly earnings progression to be significantly different from recurring historical patterns, we do anticipate a slightly lower earnings run rate in the first half of 2014 due to the continuing ramp-up in our state-based contracts.","Turning next to cash flow. We produced operating cash flow for the year of $1.7 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2012, with the decline primarily reflecting the timing of working capital items, as highlighted in this morning's press release.","For 2014, the effect of the 3Rs will impact the timing of our operating cash flows as we expect to build a receivable of $250 million to $450 million that will be collected in 2015. Accordingly, we have revised our 2014 operating cash flow guidance to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion to include this impact. Any receivable or payable amounts associated with the 3Rs should not have a significant impact on subsidiary surplus or subsidiary dividend capacity.","With respect to 2014, we are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance, as well as our segment pretax guidance ranges. As you remember from our prior guidance, we included an EPS range of plus or minus $0.25, which approximates $125 million of pretax from top to bottom. This range is wider than normal to allow for some level of volatility in our planned investment spending, as well as any normal fluctuation that may occur in our core businesses.","While we're very pleased with our strong enrollment growth during the recently completed Medicare Advantage annual enrollment season, we're still very comfortable with these wider ranges given that we're only 36 days into the year. Accordingly, for the full year 2014, we continue to see EPS within a range of $7.25 to $7.75 per share, including the previously disclosed $0.50 to $0.90 per share in investment spending for state-based contracts and the individual health care exchange business.","As we've discussed before, we expect these investments to position us well competitively and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects. We look forward to updating you on our progress when we report our first quarter results in early May.","With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Questions on the new Medicare Advantage enrollment. Just looking for some color on what the typical margin profile here is of new members in year 1 and how that trends over time. And then I noticed you completed welcome calls with 40% of your new members thus far. Hoping you can share with us what you think the risk profile of these new members looks like versus the typical new members given all the disruption in the market for 2014.","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray, Justin. We've shared with you in the past some of what we've seen with these new members. I would have said that the typical profile is 400 to 500 basis points different than the overall block of business when we first get these folks. One of the things, though, that Bruce shared with you this morning was that many of these new members are coming from some of our competitors' plans, which accelerates the revenue that we get for accurate coding of those members. And so we'll have to see how that plays out over time. So 400 to 500 basis points is a number that I would suggest that we'd seen historically. We haven't seen anything -- we've done a lot of work in the last month or so to evaluate what's been happening during the month of January, and we haven't seen anything in terms of the individuals that we were getting that would suggest that their risk profile is anything different than we've experienced in the past. We are seeing the better revenue related to these members because they're coming from a competitor plan, but I wouldn't tell you that we're seeing anything that would suggest anything negative relative to the claims exposure that we have as an organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I could just follow that questioning on the MA growth. Is there any breakout you can give us for where you saw more growth, and in particular, if you've been able to infer where the MA members were coming from in terms of competitors?","James E. Murray","Sure, this is Jim again. Some of you have asked about Florida. We did receive a significant membership growth in Florida. It appears that one of our competitors significantly changed their benefit designs and premiums, as well as the network that they had in place prior to this year in the state of Florida. When we evaluate our benefit designs relative to theirs as we exist today, their benefit designs are still a little bit richer than ours. We felt very comfortable with the benefit designs that we had in place in Florida prior to this year. And I think we change benefits modestly because of a lot of the good work that we were doing around the integrated model and some of the other things that Bruce has talked with a lot of you about in the past. We're really excited about the fact that in Florida, 33% of the members that we grew are going into very effective risk relationships that we have with a number of solid risk partners in the state of Florida. And as with all of the membership that we've gotten in our MA block, we've done a lot of study around days per 1,000 pharmacy claims, clinical participation, the risk scores. And through the month of January, we feel very good about what we're seeing as respects not only the entire block, but in particular those related to the Florida growth that we saw.","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, Matt, one of the things that I think is interesting this AP is stability. We've seen -- even though we're not the lowest-priced plan in the marketplace, because of our brand and because of the stability of what we have provided that we would -- is really one of attributes of our growth this year. And so as we look at it, it's -- I think it's a good lesson for all of the industry is stability will help grow Medicare Advantage both individually from a customer -- I mean, a company point of view and from an industry overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to follow up on Bruce's comments around 2015. I know the prelim rates are coming out a little over 2 weeks and I just wanted to understand your commentary. Were you insinuating that based on your best knowledge now, the down sort of 6% to 7%, is that going to require a change in strategy around your bidding for '15 relative to what you've done in the past? And I guess just looking at 2014 obviously, you had a similar impact in terms of rates but growing, I think, faster than anyone else in the industry. So are you saying the cumulative impact catches up in '15 and there's something different going on relative to what you've seen in the past? Or is it just we're going to continue to have to monitor and manage the business as we've done in the past?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, I mean, first, we are early in the cycle here. So similar to last year when we were earlier in the cycle, we made some general comments and then -- of what our levers are and being able to transition into the -- from those rates. But as we look at what we've accomplished over the last number of years and the pressures on the rates has really been attributed to our clinical capabilities and the great success that our team has been able to provide there. We still have opportunities in those clinical capabilities so I don't want the investors to go away and say we don't have those capabilities. But at the same time, I don't -- those capabilities can't overcome all of the cumulative effect that has taken place along with the rates that are being proposed there. And so what that does is it leaves us with the other lever points that we have and that are around benefit changes and around exiting markets. And when we get into the bid process after the finalization of the rates, we will go through the same analysis we went through last year, what are our capable trend vendors, what are those going to have an effect on, what are the rates that are being proposed or finalized, and then we'll turn to how do we need to modify benefits and what markets do we need to exit. And so I don't want to get into which ones we are going to turn to. I think we have the same levers we had before. We still have capabilities in the trend vendors that we have. Just as we look at the rates and the cumulative effect of that, I don't know if those trend vendors can overcome what's being proposed today.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And is that different than what you said last year, Bruce, not being able to overcome?","Bruce D. Broussard","At the level that was being proposed early on where they were -- where the rates were considerably -- prior to the fee schedule being included or the -- being included and then the physician fee schedule being included in that, you did hear our commentary around that we have these levers and we are concerned about the rate pressures. But again, we're talking in generalities. I mean, the letter hasn't come out, we still are studying 2014. After everything settles, we're going to begin to start focusing on what are the trend vendor capabilities, and in addition, what markets would we need to exit and what benefit changes we would need in light of whatever the finalized rates are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You said your exchange mix is coming in more in line with what you thought it was going to be originally in terms of how you priced. You talked about the risk profile on your MA enrollment coming in about in line with what you were expecting and what you normally get, yet -- and you've pushed up membership guidance, but you haven't moved your EPS expectations. Can you tell us is that just extreme conservatism at this point or is that something else that you're seeing?","Steven E. McCulley","Peter, this is Steve. I think there's still time to play out. We're 5 weeks into the year. We gave some larger ranges knowing that there was going to be some uncertainty as we went into the first quarter around how the exchanges were going to play out, and ultimately, what the risk mix is going to be there. We're very pleased with the Medicare membership, but typically, the margins, as Jim just described, are a little bit lower in the first year. We haven't seen anything there that alarms us, but it's just that it's early in the year, Peter. I think, we've -- there's still -- we gave a wider range knowing that we had a lot of potential little positives and negatives that we had to let play out. So we do feel, like I said, we don't -- we haven't said -- we don't feel uncomfortable with anything that we've seen, so there's nothing negative that we've seen. We just aren't ready to, at this 5 weeks into the year, to give anything more certain.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So at this point, is the higher end of your range more likely than the lower end?","Steven E. McCulley","I don't think we're giving a point estimate today, Peter.","James E. Murray","Just -- the one thing that I would just throw out there, these investments that we're making are a cumulative run rate of revenue of, I don't know, $5 billion. We're hiring 1,500 people to build up those businesses. Some of them are in areas that we're not as familiar with in terms of what we've done historically. And so I just think we're being prudent with staying where we're at right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to Slide 6 and understand this slide a little bit more. I understand the concept of members coming from other plans having better risk coding. But I mean, you could also envision getting a lot of members from other plans being because those plans exited high-cost patients or geographies or you potentially underpriced your business. I mean, are you saying that back in 2012 when this chart kind of looks that much different that most of the high-cost patients were in the other category? And why aren't you worried about the other potential reasons for getting membership from competitors?","James E. Murray","Let me start by saying your comment about underpricing our business in Florida in particular. Prior to the growth that we enjoyed this past year, we had a fairly healthy block of business in Florida. And when I say healthy, I meant a very solid, strong, large block of business in all of the different products. We had HMO, we had local PPO and then we had regional PPO. And we evaluated where we wanted our benefit designs and premiums to be based upon a history that was developed from that large block of business in each of those products, and that's what we put out on the streets. And fortunately, for us, we got a lot of new members that shouldn't be significantly different than the block of business that we had in place because I believe we had upwards of 50,000 regional PPO members prior to the growth that we enjoyed, a significant block of local PPO members and hundreds of thousands of HMO members. And so we felt very comfortable with our understanding of the Florida marketplace. And so I just wanted to address your comment about the underpricing our products in the state of Florida.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I guess, were you able to get the cost breakout between other? Is that where the issue in 2012 was? It was mostly high cost in the other category, and that's why you feel like when that gets smaller, that's why?","James E. Murray","When we look at some competitor actions, one of our competitors changed their benefits and premiums, their overall economic value that they provided to the members in the state of Florida by over nearly $50 per member per month. And they came very close to what our benefit design was before the start of this year. And so I just throw that out as -- for all of you to evaluate.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think what the question is highlighting is what's -- in 2012, we had large growth and we -- the clinical utilization was higher than what was expected, and what makes 2014 any different. And I would probably turn to -- our benefits are in line with the marketplace or slightly, I would say, less favorable than the marketplace, and our brand is able to really push the growth to a higher level, I guess, back to the stability side. Second thing is, is that I would say that our relationship with the providers in our marketplace over the last few years has greatly improved too as a result of our path to risk and our shared risk program that we continue to focus on. And so as we see our membership growth, the stability has really allowed the growth to accelerate this year in a very, very uncertain environment. But then on top of that, I would say that our clinical programs that we have as an organization have matured in such a great way. And as you look at our performance in the latter half of 2012 and in 2013, those clinical programs and the success of those clinical programs have expressed themselves in really overachievement of our financial results. And as you look at that, those clinical programs, they position us well to deal with the growth that we're dealing with in 2014. Complementing those clinical growth, the -- I mean, the clinical capabilities is the source of the membership and in really 2 parts: The clinical programs that were from other competitors that have provided the documentation for the members coming in from their plans, it facilitates the coding that usually takes 6 months or so to address; and then secondarily, being in HMO and risk -- shared risk relationships facilitates the clinical aspects to this. So when we look at this book of business, both from the ability of where it's coming from, where it is located within our plan selection and in addition the maturity of our clinical programs, we feel comfortable with the block that's come in and the cohort when compared to 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you maybe help us or walk through the assumptions on the 3Rs included in that cash flow guidance? I think you said that you set up what looks like a $250 million receivable for 2015. I guess if you could help sort of walk through kind of the visibility and, I guess, the ability to sort of predict that number at this stage, just some of the dynamics around that would be helpful.","Steven E. McCulley","Sure. Thanks, Ralph. This is Steve. We've made our best estimate at that number to be a range of $250 million to $450 million, which is still a fairly wide range because it's very early in the process. The largest component of that is the reinsurance reimbursement, so that is more than half of the number. And then the remainder would be what we might see with the risk corridors and ultimately what risk adjustment is. Of the 3, the risk adjustment is the hardest one to estimate. We do feel like we'll be able to make a reasonable estimate of that at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter based on the data that's available. Those -- the 3Rs tend to work together in that if we, for example, make an estimate for the risk adjustment. And if that estimate then flows into the risk corridor calculation, where if you're outside of the band, there's an 80% reimbursement there. So if you ultimately change your estimate of risk adjustment, then there tends to be an offsetting effect in the risk corridor. So they're not -- they're kind of interrelated to a degree. So ultimately, we've kind of modeled -- we've modeled the different scenarios and that gave us the range of $250 million to $450 million, ultimately, that we think we'll have a receivable on our books by the end of the year. Again, the largest amount of that being the reinsurance reimbursement. The one thing that we point -- that I pointed out on my script to make sure that I'm clear about it is that we have -- as we build receivables for those items, they'll be in our statutory entities, our legal entities, as admitted assets. So they generally don't really impact our cash flow that we'll get from the subsidiaries to the parent. So although they are a reduction of our consolidated operating cash flow, there's not always a lot of connectivity between that operating cash flow and what the parent cash flow is if we end up with receivables that are assets in our subsidiaries that we collect the following year. And that's very similar to what happened when we -- when Part D ramped up back in 2006, we had some fairly hefty risk corridor receivables in the first couple of years of that as well. Does that make sense?","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about your care management capacity? Just making the assumption that you staffed care management broadly to 210,000 lives. And now that the enrollment is going to be 50% higher than that, does the existing capacity able to handle all that new enrollment? Or are you guys out there hiring, getting people trained in sort of on an ongoing basis to handle the new membership?","James E. Murray","We've been hiring folks over the last year and have been pretty successful identifying nurse practitioners throughout all of the markets that we operate in, not only for the telephonic chronic management programs, but also the nurses that go into the home, and we also use a lot of agencies as a part of our network. And we've been fairly successful with ramping up. I think Bruce referenced earlier, we have a target of having 350,000 folks as a part of our SeniorBridge\/Humana Cares program by the end of the year. And that includes all of the growth that we've just talked about, and we don't feel uncomfortable with our ability to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just hoping you can reconcile the change in the cash flow in terms of increasing the assumptions on the 3Rs relative to some of the commentary that you've talked about in terms of the risk indicators that you provided. Is the risk mix -- sort of where do you stand right now in terms of that assumption of where the risk mix is relative to the initial pricing? Do you still view that as more adverse than initially expected and that's why you increased the 3Rs? Or is there another factor driving that increased assumption around the 3Rs and the change to the cash flows?","James E. Murray","So this is Jim, and I'll start off and maybe Steve will finish up. I would tell you that because of some of the changes that happened, through no fault of anybody's, but some of the issues that happened with the website initially and then some of the changes that occurred with the transitions -- or the transitional program, we do believe that there was a bit of deterioration in the risk mix that we are going to get as an organization. But as many of you have pointed out in some of your write-ups, the 3Rs give you a significant amount of protection around that. So although there's a deterioration, we believe, in the overall risk mix, which will correct itself in theory over the next several years, and so it's a timing item, that has negatively impacted us to some extent. The other thing that Bruce pointed out that we want to make sure everybody is clear about is that when the size of the exchange marketplace is shrinking and because of the transitional policy, the premiums that we would get on a per-member, per-month basis, our overall revenue assumptions that we started the year with are down. And so we have a bit of a scale issue. We don't have the benefit of some of the size or might of some of the competitors that are in this space. And so when we don't get the revenue that we anticipated and we've built the administrative infrastructure to support that, we have a scale issue, that also is a part of the range that we've put out there with this particular business. And then the other thing that we've learned in the last month or so is that this group of people is very different in terms of service than our existing blocks of business. And it's taken a significant increase in the number of service representatives that we've had to get the folks the answers that they're looking for. And so for all of those reasons, it's -- there has been a bit of a deterioration in risk profile, which will correct itself over time, and then the scale and the administrative issue are some of the things that go into the financial projections that Steve talked about earlier.","Steven E. McCulley","Scott, the only thing I would add is that again, the reinsurance recoverable is the largest amount of that. And there's going to be a number there, where almost regardless of the risk selection, it maybe it will get a little larger with a little more adverse risk, but that's just a calculation of the claims that are over a certain specific limit.","James E. Murray","Right. And that was a part of our pricing from the very beginning.","Steven E. McCulley","Right. There is a -- the limit in the law was, I believe, $60,000. It's been proposed to lower that to $45,000. We've -- and that's part of the reason, again, we have a range of $250 million to $450 million is it encompasses both outcomes.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like there's a pretty significant SG&A component to the revised 3R assumptions, as well as some of the MLR influences?","James E. Murray","That's correct. But again, remember, this is 3% of our total revenue. And so we're just dealing and talking about this from that particular aspect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm trying to understand the protection you have with your provider arrangements and your risk arrangements and your path to risk, particularly if the rates in kind of 2015 don't turn out as we hope they will, and if they turn out kind of negative as they were this year. How much protection does your risk membership and the path to risk expected next year protect you? What portion of costs are capitated versus -- these are providers that you own, so the problem kind of flows from the managed care entity to the provider entity but stays with you. How much is independent versus with you?","James E. Murray","Christine, you're talking about 2015 now?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, but you can use current number for X percent capitated and we expect to be Y or however you want to express it.","James E. Murray","I don't have it offhand. I think it may be in the press release pages, the amount of capitation that we have as an organization. Obviously, when our funding levels are reduced, that flows through to the risk takers that do business with us, as well as to our own owned entities, again, I don't have the percentages. I can tell you that we've had conversations and dialogues with our risk-takers about things that we could do together to help them and us control costs, not only for some of the things that we're dealing with, but also the unit costs that we share together for some of the hospitals that are part of our networks, the specialists that are a part of our network. It's a pretty detailed effort that we go through to help those risk-takers because we don't want to just pass the costs or the funding reductions through to them because that's not being a good partner. And so there's a lot of work that we're doing as we speak, working with those risk-takers on how we can rethink the cost structure that they have and address some of these issues that we face. Again, I don't have the percentages in front of me. Perhaps, the...","Steven E. McCulley","Christine, this is Steve, and I know -- I think we've talked about this a little bit in the past. I want to say the risk is around 30%, but we'll look that number up. The one thing I would add to what Jim said is that also in our HMO that's on a path to risk but is still HMO versus PPO, there is a percentage of that cost, the primary care reimbursement, for example, is a capitated reimbursement, as well as the specialty network that most of those -- a lot of the specialty networks that those PCPs operating in is capitated as well, even though the PCP may not be in a full-risk arrangement yet. So there is a -- so we do get a beneficial effect from having just regular HMO even though it's not full risk. So it's hard. I think what you're trying to do is quantify the net impact of all that and maybe we can go offline or go out and try to make an estimate of that. But it's -- but hope that helps.","Regina Nethery","This is Regina, Christine. Just so you're aware on page, I don't have the numbers directly in front of me, but on Page S-13, it shows the provider counts in the press release, that page is S-13. I believe it's S-19 at the bottom gives the Medicare membership that is covered in risk arrangements.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right, right. But I was looking more for percent of the cost as opposed to just the membership...","Regina Nethery","I apologize. Okay.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's okay. We'll follow up offline, but that's really helpful. I'm kind of estimating about 45% of costs are kind of capitated. But I just kind of -- we can follow up offline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So operating costs in the quarter were higher than I expected. Can you kind of discuss what investments and start-up costs were in the 4Q numbers? And how does that compare to what's assumed for 2014? What should we think as onetime versus run rate?","Steven E. McCulley","Andrew, this is Steve. So we did have a number of things in the quarter that were maybe higher than normal. But typically, our fourth quarter operating costs are the highest quarter for us because we have -- it's the selling season for Medicare. So in the Retail segment, if you look at that -- in our Retail segment, our operating cost ratio increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the marketing cost, distribution cost. Because we had such a successful open enrollment season for 2014, there was more distribution cost than normal, more commissions, for example. We also had investments in exchange readiness, both technology and operating expenses in the fourth quarter, the ramp-up, to get ready for the health care exchanges. Also in the Retail segment, we're investing in the duals expansion. As Jim mentioned earlier, there's a significant build-out that we're basically building a duals business that will be a $4 million -- $4 billion plus run rate business by 2015 that we're currently in the process of building, and some of that was in our fourth quarter of 2014 as well. We also, maybe over in the other segments, we had what I would say are some non-recurring type expenses. We did have some severance expenses as a result of some reorganizations that were done primarily in our Employer Group segment. We wrote off a few -- we had a few asset impairments. We wrote down some deferred acquisition costs in our -- in some voluntary -- group voluntary benefits businesses that we had, and maybe a few other smaller things, but nothing individually that was significant. But that's really the driver of why you see the higher operating cost in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Just a follow-up real quick. I mean, when I think about the exchange cost and the dual cost, I mean, are these essentially run-rate costs that you just don't have revenues to offset today? So the costs kind of stay the same, but as revenues ramp, the ratio declines or are these onetime start-up costs...","Steven E. McCulley","I think the duals is the former. The duals -- there might be a little bit of onetime cost in the duals, but ultimately, there's cost ahead of the revenue in the duals. In the exchanges, there's a little bit of that same thing, cost ahead of revenue, but I also think there's -- we're in a volatile period around phones ringing and a lot of questions about this new business. I don't know if, Jim, you want to elaborate on that any?","James E. Murray","No, I think you said it very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'll continue on the duals topic. It's a relatively new area for you guys, and I was wondering if you could talk about what you've put in place to stay on top of the cost, maybe in the way of claims review, technology that looks at specifically high-cost items for the duals population that may not match up with your traditional Medicare book, or assumptions throughout the first year progression on MLR for the duals contract for you guys.","Bruce D. Broussard","First thing, the duals for us as a company is very aligned with the Medicare Advantage population. I think as most of you guys know, that 25% or so of Medicare is in the duals population. So they're a little sicker, but I would say that they're probably aligned with our chronic program that we already have. So as we think about our capabilities as an organization, we will use the same capabilities that we're using in Medicare Advantage. And that's on the post-65. The one additional capability that we didn't need as an organization for the duals is around the long-term care area, which we both have a partnership with a very capable organization and, I think as everyone knows, we acquired an organization in Florida recently, American Eldercare, that has that capability. So we have added that, and that is -- the integration is going quite well. In regards to the Medicaid population pre-65, I think as the investors know, we have partnered with other firms to manage that population, and we really don't have a lot of active management in the pre-65 or the TANF population. And so as you think about our core capabilities, it's really not in the TANF population, it is in the post-65 population, and it aligns with our Medicare capabilities adding long-term care to that.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And the last part of the question was just the MLR assumptions built into your guidance on the duals.","James E. Murray","The overall state-based programs, MLRs, are probably somewhere, when all up and running, somewhere in the 90% range. The admin on this business would probably be a lot lower because of the high revenue that you have on a per-member, per-month basis. I think the margins that we ultimately see ourselves achieving are very similar to some of the margins that you see from the public companies that are in this space.","Bruce D. Broussard","And just to add to the question on the duals and being prepared for it, 3 of the large contracts will be coming up in the second quarter of this year, in the latter part of the second quarter of this year. And so we, today, are making a lot of investments. And as the point was made before, there's not much revenue coming in as a result of that. But we're preparing for those 3 large contracts during this quarter and in the early part of the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's actually Dave Styblo filling in for Windley. I had a question. I know we've talked a little bit about operating cash flow, but I'd be curious to hear your comments about the parent cash roll forward. I'm also thinking in the context here of seeing a pretty large buyback that you guys made in the fourth quarter, just especially when the stock was at its high. So I'm just curious to see what your thoughts are and strategy around buybacks, as well as how that would look forward into the parent cash roll forward between here and the end of the year?","Steven E. McCulley","Sure. This is Steve. Well, number one, our philosophy hasn't changed around capital deployment. We continue to fund our capital expenditures and invest in things that grow the business. And then as we have excess cash, we return it to the shareholders in terms of share repurchasing and dividends, and that philosophy remains intact. I think during the quarter, we repurchased about $200 million worth of shares with the excess cash we had, and we ended the year with parent cash of around $500 million. The -- what we'll do in the next call is update you on our dividends that we received from the subs and give you a more full year outlook on the parent cash and where we're at, at that time. We like to wait until we talk to the rating agencies and get through the -- get through all the statutory filings before we finalize kind of those look-forwards. We are growing the duals business, which does require some subsidiary capital, and we also grew our Medicare business quite nicely as well in 2014. So those 2 things do require capital as we grow those businesses. But I think what we'll do is give you a more fulsome update at the end of the quarter when we have our dividends finalized. Does that help?","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just maybe go back to the rate notice issue. You got out in front of it in saying the 6% to 7% down was a possibility. Is there anything we can read, either from industry discussions, your discussions with the administration, the fact that they did the December rate -- trend update and gave the industry a heads-up on that to suggest that maybe we'll get some mitigation on that? And to the extent we do, what would you guys look to last year by focusing on the doc [ph] fix? Where would be the obvious places for them to look, if you have any thoughts?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, A.J., I think getting the trend out earlier is, I think, an effort for them to provide more transparency on the process. Last year, one of the areas that the industry worked with them on is how can we become more transparent. And, a, it's not a surprise; and, b, we can work on educating pre the announcement as opposed to doing it during the announcement. And I do have to commend the administration for helping us with that and getting it out earlier and it allows us to understand it. We still have some questions to understand it and in addition, to work with them on where those differences are. I really don't want to get into the speculation on what are the various different components that could be -- maybe alter the rate notice or the projections that we've put out there and let us -- I think the industry is going to begin to work with the administration on this and give us some time to work with the administration because I do think understanding where they're coming from is an important part of that process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just following up on the rate again and not so much speculating, but I believe there was a proposal on not accepting just the health risk assessments as data to support risk adjustment. And how does that play into your 15% solution? You have a slide here, which shows that's gone from 20% to 40%. Do you think by 2015, if that went through, particularly for the agents, that it could materially impact your margins?","James E. Murray","I'm not familiar with what it is you're pointing to, so we'd have to take that back and look through it and try to better understand it. So I apologize for not being as up to speed on that as I should be.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then if you could get back to me on that, that'd be great. I saw this in the Medicare Advantage news, and I think there was a proposal in the December communication as well from CMS. And on the PDP, what gives you comfort now that your guidance has gone 4x compared to your preliminary guidance that there is no issue around your formulary design or something that you had in 2008?","James E. Murray","Well, just like I talked -- this is Jim, again, Murray. We've looked at a lot of claims data since the beginning of the year. We understand the population. A lot of the growth was from our existing Walmart plan retention. We had, frankly, anticipated that a lot of the prior Walmart plan members would go to the new Walmart plan. That didn't happen, so we obviously have a good sense for the folks there. And then the new Walmart plan, we feel pretty good about how we're looking at the drug claims that we paid during the month of January. So we feel very good about the risk profile that exists with each of our 3 product offerings in the PDP space and wouldn't anticipate any kinds of issues developing there.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Bruce D. Broussard","Like every quarter, we really thank the investors for the support of the organization, especially in this time of change and complexity. And at the same time, we also understand that our success of the organization is dependent on our associates and all 51,000 that come in to work every day and with their best minds and helping our members succeed in their health journey. So I appreciate everyone's support, and have a wonderful day.","Operator","With that, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11473":["Humana Inc.

Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning\u2019s earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This morning, we reported second quarter earnings per share of $2.19 reflecting our strong membership growth year-to-date juxtaposed against investments in healthcare exchanges and state-based contracts as well as clinical spending to weather the funding cuts the Medicare Advantage business continues to experience. We continue to have confidence in our full year forecasted earnings of $7.25 to $7.75 per share with the completion of another quarter of solid performance in our base businesses.","As usual, the second quarter was a busy one. We submitted our bids to CMS for the 2015 plan year for individual Medicare Advantage, group MA and standalone PDP offerings and expect the vast majority of our members to experience stable premiums next year. We anticipate no significant changes in our geographic presence, but do expect to offer HMOs in nearly 65 new counties next year. CMS is in the process of reviewing our bids. So, we will not be disclosing any further about our 2015 plan designs at this point. However, we do believe that our offerings will continue to outpace solid value proposition to Medicare beneficiaries and result in a net membership growth next year.","We continue to be encouraged by the power of our integrated care delivery strategy, which contains three major areas. First, care delivery; second, consumer experience; and third, data analytics. Our strategy is designed to make it easy for people to achieve their best health and as demonstrated by our strong membership growth, it resonates well with our consumers. Our analytical capabilities are an important driver of the returns on our clinical investments. To that end, I will spend a few minutes this morning talking about why our ability to connect and analyze data and in turn and into actionable insights for our members and providers. It is so critical to our integrated delivery model.","Looking at Slide 6, we have made great progress in the past two years. Our integration of Anvita\u2019s analytical engine into our clinical workflow and messaging system is allowing us to proactively enroll members in clinical programs. In addition, the connectivity of providers through our Certify engine combined with our population health analytics, like documentation review and quality measurements is assisting our provider partners in managing value-based relationships. Through this integration, we can be a better partner with our providers to share with them data that is integrated from both a clinical and financial perspective. Providers receive relevant and actionable insights at both the population and member level. This allows them to see the broad picture of what is happening with our populations and drawdown on specific patients and why trends are occurring. In turn, this helps the physicians manage the health of their members more effectively, a key to value-added relationships with providers.","Slide 7 clearly demonstrates that our focus is paying off. Members\u2019 quality health measures compliance has risen significantly over the past two years. It is a combination of the high-tech capabilities I have just described in the high touch care for our members living with chronic health conditions that underpins the success of our strategy and the value proposition for our members.","Turning next to our product offerings on Slide 8. As we shared with you in last quarter\u2019s call, our Medicare membership has grown significantly this year. While we also anticipate net growth for individual Medicare in 2015, it is far too early to gauge the extent of that growth. We anticipate that sharing with you when we give our detailed 2015 guidance this fall.","Turning to state-based contracts, the implementation process is progressing as planned, despite the delay in the start from some of the states. Opt out rates are coming in a bit higher than we had expected, but our claims and pharmacy trends are in line with our expectations. Our healthcare exchange membership also grew substantially during the second quarter given the influx of applications late in the first quarter. Our 2015 rates for exchange offerings have been filed with the various states and are pending approval. We believe the rate increases we have filed are not unexpected given the change in the population demographic dynamics that occurred subsequent to the state premiums for 2014.","Finally, let me turn to our pharmacy benefit management business and address some of the questions we received from investors regarding our intended strategy. As you can see on Slide 9, the size of our PBM is substantial. You can think of it as an approximately $17 billion business with pre-tax margins in the 2.5% to 3% range. Our RightSource mailing operation has revenues in the $3.5 billion range, which are included in the $17 billion I just referenced. As with all our businesses, we want to maximize the value of these assets while achieving our strategic and operational goals. As I have said previously, a thorough and rigorous analysis of our PBM is underway, which includes a strategic and financial review. The financial review will include an analysis of our network purchasing, pharmacy inventory procurement and pharmacy dispensing. The strategic review will include some items that are distinct to our PBM, which I would like to highlight today.","First, our PBM is a key part of our integrated delivery model as well as a critical strategic component of our consumer-focused retail business. Pharmacy is the single most utilized benefit by our members and we want to ensure that the experience continues to be of the highest quality. Further, our clinical programs that seek to improved medication adherence are a key to improving overall health outcomes for our members. Second, we will consider our third-party relationships, including our very significant relationship with Wal-Mart. We will consider in our analysis the potential effects on that relationship.","Third, the proportion of our Medicaid business within the PDM makes it distinct from some of the other PBMs and commercial OEM transactions in this space. For example, we expect any potential incremental savings from retail network pricing would primarily be put back towards enhancing benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, regulatory compliance will continue to be of utmost importance for any partnering relationship we might consider. This analysis will include the required flexibility with the anticipated Medicaid growth, changes in clinical protocols and current and future compliance capabilities. Each of these factors will need to be balanced against the potential benefits of any transaction including unit pricing as well as fulfillment costs. These are the factors I have just described. We expect that analysis of the PBM business will take a good amount of time to complete. When we conclude the process we expect to update investors. We appreciate your patience in the interim.","Our industry has never been, and likely never will be, one where changes are few and far between. We believe Humana is well positioned to not only survive, but to thrive in this dynamic environment. In sum, our integrated care delivery strategy combined with the robust membership growth and state of our national demographics comprise a strong chassis upon which Humana\u2019s future growth will be built. We look forward to sharing further updates with you as the year continues to play out.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brian for a review of our financials.","Brian Kane - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Bruce and good morning everyone. This morning we reported earnings per share of $2.19 for the second quarter of 2014. As expected, that was lower than the $2.63 reported for the second quarter of last year due primarily to our investments in healthcare exchanges and state-based contracts as well as higher specialty drug costs for a new treatment of hepatitis C that we discussed in last quarter\u2019s call. Partially offsetting those headwinds was the solid results in our base business and the benefit of share purchases over the last 12 months.","I would like to begin with a discussion of the strength of our base business. The underlying strong performance of our Medicare advantage business and our healthcare services operations continued to drive our results and have helped us to overcome some substantial headwinds as indicated on Slide 11.","With respect to our Medicare advantage business, we continued to see a decline in our hospital admissions compared to prior year levels, largely driven by our care management programs. As indicated in this morning\u2019s press release, member with complex chronic conditions that are enrolled in our chronic-care management programs are up over 50% from last year given the acceleration and timing for getting to know our members\u2019 health conditions. With respect to our newly enrolled members, they continued to perform in line with our expectations. However, I would note that benefit ratios of new members typically run higher in the first year.","We are also very pleased with our mail-order pharmacy operations, as it reflects both strong Medicare growth and mail-order usage by seniors in our Medicare advantage and standalone PDP offerings which continues trend favorably. The strength of these businesses has allowed us to overcome several challenging issues which we have discussed at length in the past including; provisions of the affordable care act that became effective in 2014 including the industry fee which increases the operating cost ratios for the retail and employer group segments by 150 basis points and 180 basis points respectively. New and costly hepatitis C treatments which we continued to estimate at $0.40 to $0.50 EPS impact for the year and clinical investments of $0.40 to $0.50 in 2014 to help position us for the future which we mentioned last quarter. Moreover we are facing three additional headwinds, the details of which I will discuss shortly including higher marketing spend as we position for 2015, delay in implementation of our state based contracts and finally the extension of the ACA transitional relief provisions.","Looking at our updated full year forecast, we continued to expect 2014 EPS in the range of $7.25 to $7.75 with some revisions to each of our segments as noted on Slide 12. For the retail segment our Medicare advantage business as I mentioned, continues to perform well. And our standalone PDP and healthcare exchange businesses are tracking in line with our previous expectations. There are two items noted on Slide 12 which together resulted in a reduction of our full year retail segment forecast by $50 million.","First, we expect higher marketing costs of approximately $30 million for our Medicare Advantage and PDP businesses. This is primarily due to expectations for the 2015 enrollment campaign as we consider what we expect to be a continued solid value proposition and stability in premiums for our members. The remaining $20 million relates to our expansion in state-based contracts, which is driven by two items. First, the implementation dates for Illinois and Virginia were pushed back by two to three months but are now up and running. Since we had ramped up our infrastructure for an earlier implementation, the delay in revenues had an adverse impact on our full year outlook. Second, as the dual eligible contracts in Illinois and Virginia became effective, the entire industry has experienced a higher opt-out rate than originally expected ranging from 23% to 30%. Consequently, we have revised our full year outlook to reflect a higher opt-out percentage going forward.","Turning to the employer group segment, we have lowered our outlook by $25 million for 2014 due primarily to the fact that small group employers are keeping their existing plans at higher rates than we had previously forecasted, which resulted from the March 2014 extension of the administration\u2019s transitional policy through October of 2016. The transitional relief allows certain employers to renew their existing plans at rates lower than the higher post-ACA rates, with no change in likely claims experience. After the announcement of the transitional policy extension in March, we saw a substantial increase in the percentage of employers taking advantage of that transitional relief. Consequently we have lowered the 2014 outlook for our small group business.","Finally, as we look at the Healthcare Services segment, these businesses continued to exceed our expectations. And accordingly we have raised our full-year outlook by $75 million. The over performance was driven by our mail-order prescription drug operations, our home care business and our primary care operations. Each of these businesses plays a key role in our integrated delivery model, care delivery model for our Medicare Advantage population and have benefited from our growth in Medicare Advantage enrollment. We continued to experience higher than expected prescription drug volumes in our mail-order business. And our home care business is benefiting from servicing more of our membership in our chronic care programs. In total, these changes in our segment guidance net out to zero, so we continued to expect 2014 EPS of $7.25 to $7.75 and are pleased with the underlying performance of the base business.","Turning next to our exchange business on Slide 13; our outlook for 2014 remains in line with our previous estimates. As a reminder, the 3Rs were established to stabilize premium rates for individuals during the transitions to the exchanges and were funded via taxes and fees levied upon the industry. With respect to the 3Rs we continued to anticipate receivables at year end of $575 million to $775 million. As indicated on Slide 13, approximately three quarters of this total results from the reinsurance provisions of the ACA, whereby insurers will recover 80% of the claim expenses that exceeds the $45,000 attachment point up to $250,000.","The reinsurance receivable naturally rises as we proceed through the year and individuals exceed the attachment point. These reinsurance provisions continue into 2015 and 2016 with the 80% level of reinsurance declines to 50% next year and our pricing includes consideration for these changes. The majority of our ACA membership was effective in the second quarter and the very early drug claims data indicate that those members are on average younger and healthier than those that enrolled in the first quarter. Additionally, we believe as exchange enrollment levels continue to increase, the overall morbidity of the risk pool will continue to improve, which will help mitigate the need to raise rates further as the reinsurance and risk corridors unwind over the next few years.","Turning next to the balance sheet, the parent company has now received dividends from our regulated insurance subsidiaries totaling $914 million, with $695 million being received in the second quarter and $219 million being received in July. This was in line with our expectations and consistent with prior year levels. As indicated in this morning\u2019s press release, we have repurchased 805,500 of our outstanding shares during the quarter totaling $101 million.","With regard to capital allocation, over the coming months, we are committed to taking a fresh look at our financial leverage, capital allocation and return policies. We will evaluate increasing the amount of capital we return to shareholders beyond what we have historically done while considering the needs and opportunities of our business. The principal driver of capital allocation for us is our need to have ample capacity to invest in our significant top line growth and attractive MA opportunities when they become available.","That being said, the clarity around our capital needs has improved over time now that we have better visibility around Medicare rate cuts, the duals and exchanges. We understand the importance of returning capital to our shareholders when we are able to do so. While I am new to the company, these are issues I am intimately familiar with given my prior experience in analyzing how to optimize a company\u2019s capital structure, capital allocation and capital return policies for the shareholder\u2019s benefit, while at the same time preserving the flexibility a company requires to execute its strategy. As such, our balance sheet capacity and capital allocation policy are front and center issues for us.","That concludes my prepared remarks, but before opening the line for questions, I would like to briefly express how fortunate I feel to join an organization with such strong leadership and dedicated and hardworking associates. In particular, I would like to thank Steve McCulley whose operational depth and extensive knowledge, along with the partnership we have formed are invaluable. I look forward to meeting our investors and want to remind everyone that our Biannual Investor Day is scheduled for December 4. We will be moving that event back to New York City this year. Details on the Investor Day will follow in the coming months.","With that, we will open lines up for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities","Thank you. I know it\u2019s still relatively early in the year, but I was hoping that you could kind of go over briefly some headwinds and tailwinds as you think about 2015?","Jim Murray","This is Jim Murray. In terms of 2015 headwinds that I would think about would be whatever happens with the funding from CMS as respects our premiums, which we use as a part of our bid development process. Offsetting that fairly significantly were some of the things we did around trend vendors. We had a fairly solid year in terms of what we were able to accomplish with trend vendors that we use for our bid process, we feel really good about that. In part that\u2019s why we chose to increase our marketing spend for the coming AEP, because of how we think our bids firmed up. Continued visibility in terms of what\u2019s going to play out with the exchange business, we feel really good about where we are sitting right now in terms of what we had anticipated. A lot of our pricing philosophy seemed to be playing out and the 3Rs are offsetting some of the negatives that occurred relative to changes in the program as it went along. We have talked a little bit, Bruce referenced our pricing and some of what we did for pricing for 2015, we feel good about that. We feel good about the way that the population is expanding. We have an estimate for how much participation we expect in the exchanges in 2015 and that was an integral part of our pricing.","And then ultimately, the play out of how the Medicaid business all comes together, we are seeing a lot of build out this year in some of the investment we are doing around all of the state-based programs. We are getting some visibility into medical spend and the administrative infrastructure necessary for those programs and we feel pretty good about how they are all rolling out. So, frankly, when I look at a lot of the things that are on the horizon, I feel pretty confident about our prospects for 2015. We are always very careful and very judicious to identify anything that might surprise us, but again I feel pretty good about how 2015 seems to be shaping up.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays","Hi, thanks. I guess the first question is just around the exchanges and I will admit a couple harder to find. So, the first would be how should we think about the 3Rs on a relative basis and I know you can\u2019t speak to what others are accruing, etcetera, but what would be some of the key determinations why Humana would be a higher or lower impact from the 3Rs? And then maybe just longer term I guess even just 2015, what\u2019s the endgame for all of these members that are at margins that are way below what you would expect to be long-term targeted members \u2013 margins? I mean I have seen some of the rate increases that are very significant for next year, should e assume membership in the exchanges is going to trickle down over the next couple of years or would you actually be able to maintain this level of membership and still increase the price?","Steve McCulley","Hey, Josh. This is Steve. I will take maybe the 3R question and then maybe Jim can talk about the second part of that question. On the 3Rs as you know we have shared just some slides today about our full year outlook there, which is I think more disclosure than others. And if you think about the reinsurance component of that, which is the biggest, again that\u2019s a determinable of the number that we can get from our claims experience, that\u2019s over the threshold and below 250. And I can\u2019t speak to how other companies are viewing that or how they are accruing it, but in general those levels at the end of the day for reinsurance ought to be relatively comparable. I guess if we have a \u2013 if we were more hit by the transactional relief rules, so our health mix is worse than others on average than that reinsurance per member could be higher, but everybody is going to have a fair amount of reinsurance. It\u2019s going to be the driver of everyone\u2019s 3Rs including ours.","I would note that we are just accruing the 80% portion of that reinsurance, where there is some talk of that potentially being funded further, but we haven\u2019t considered that. So, that\u2019s kind of \u2013 other than that we talked last quarter about the \u2013 we look at how we are positioned in each state in terms of the amount of members that we brought in that were not previously underwritten and we can look at that data versus the state as a whole and make some estimates around risk adjustment. That\u2019s not a \u2013 again, that\u2019s not a primary driver of the receivable, but we would expect to have some risk adjustment receivable. And again to the extent that, that estimate is off a little bit, it would be offset 80% in the risk corridor. So, those numbers tend to play together. So, that\u2019s kind of how we view the 3Rs and I don\u2019t know if you can talk about the second part.","Jim Murray","Yes, expecting that we would get a question related to the exchanges, I will just share some random thoughts with you and you can take it from there. I always like to remind everybody that the exchange business in the HumanaOne revenues for Humana, it represents 5% of our overall revenues. We also and Josh you referenced the margins, we are investing this year, but we fully expect that over the next several years that we will produce the same kinds of margin that you have heard from some of our competition. I think folks have talked about ranges of 3% to 5% and we feel comfortable that over the next several years that we can achieve that kind of margin level. And the important piece for us related to that was what happened this past year in terms of us gaining scale. Our membership doubled, but our revenues tripled as a result of the exchange business and that went a long way towards us getting the same kind of scale that some of those others have talked about in terms of gaining those margins that I referenced a moment ago. Also for us and why we are in this business, we think that over time there is going to be a shift to a retail form of business and obviously this sets us up nicely for this. And it\u2019s a nice synergy between the Medicare business and the Medicaid business in terms of an aging opportunity for the Medicare business.","And for Medicaid, you have heard and some of you have talked about the fact that some of the folks who are part of this program are going to go in and out of Medicaid and into some these kinds of offerings. And so we think it sets us up nice for our retail business as a whole. Some of the things that we have learned as a result of this past year, obviously the scale is something that we are very pleased about. Our philosophy about low price has developed with a very efficient network and an HMO form of product seems to have played out into the marketplace and helped us to gain some of the membership that we have seen in the three Rs, the financial projection \u2013 protection that they were designed to provide played out nicely for us as a lot of the changes took place and some of the changes to the reinsurance element of the three Rs offset some of the negatives as respect to adverse selection.","We have already talked a little bit about the premium increases. We have meaningful premium increases out there that we think position us well for the future and move us towards those margins that we talked about. We fully expect that the pool will continue to increase. Our pricing assumes that there will be about 11 million participants next year. We have also included in our pricing the fact and Brian spoke to this, that two of the three Rs are going to wind down, we don\u2019t expect that they are going to exist forever and our pricing for \u201815 and \u201816 we will assume that they will ultimately be gone and will be left to a risk adjustment which frankly as a company we are pretty good at because of what in the Medicare business.","We looked at some of the pricing that some of the competition has done over the last several weeks and months, it looks like the national and regional competitors in this space are being pretty price intelligent. There is a couple of co-ops in some smaller players in specific markets or specific states that seem to be doing some pretty interesting stuff. But generally we feel pretty good about the way the competitive marketplace is setting up, so we feel pretty good about this business. That was a long explanation, I apologize.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays","One clarification, I just want to make sure I got it right. So you are expecting 11 million in exchange is that going to be 8.4, and you are putting through some significant rate increases which starts I guess in 2015, does that mean Humana is expecting more membership on exchanges next year?","Jim Murray","I don\u2019t know that we can expect more membership. I don\u2019t expect that we are going to shrink significantly. I think the level of scale that we achieved this past year was solid. We will see how things play out. I don\u2019t anticipate we are going to grow significantly, nor shrink significantly.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays","Okay, perfect.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to follow-up and just really think about sustainable earnings power here kind of going forward, but specifically can you give us an update on the losses that you are generating in exchanges for 2014 and would it be fair to think about the path being kind of breakeven for \u201815 and hitting target margins by \u201816. And then just quickly, can you give us your current thoughts on the run rate of Medicare Advantage margins and Healthcare Services segment earnings, that\u2019s being sustainable or not at these levels going into next year? Thanks.","Steve McCulley","Hi. This is Steve. Justin I will take the first part of that question which was the investments we are making. As you remember last quarter we did the total investments that we are making in the exchanges and the duals on a state based contracts was we started out the year at I think it was $0.50 to $0.90 a midpoint of $0.70 and that improved last quarter because of the exchange growth helped us get more scale as Jim just mentioned. And we improved our outlook for the exchanges for this year and nothing has changed on the exchanges for this year from 90 days ago. Things have played out like we thought, so that\u2019s still the same. What did change though this time is the investment in the duals and the state based contracts went up by $20 million as Brian mentioned in his remarks due to the delays in the contracts there, and the opt-out percentages. So net-net the total investment this year is about the same. So again, as we go to next year, we expect to do better in the exchanges and certainly the duals as well. So we haven\u2019t obviously guided the 2015 numbers yet, but that\u2019s kind of how we see it.","Bruce Broussard","Justin just to add a few things to that, I mean we have made in statements that we do, I want to see the exchanges breakeven during 2015, and that is a target we have set internally. It might not in the whole year, but during the year we are very focused on breaking even. And both managing our costs as Jim articulated, adjusting for the pricing and with the anticipation of the 2Rs going away along with we anticipate the pool will continue to improve as the grandfathering clause works its way out.","Your second question was on duals, we have our contracts are usually three to five years. We anticipate the first year we need to make an investment. And I think over the three-year period of time we have priced it at the appropriate return on invested capital. But it will take some time for us to get scale as you will see improvement in 2015 and then \u201816 I think you will continue to see improvement in there. We haven\u2019t made the same comment on exchanges as we had in duals, if it\u2019s going to be one, is it going to be profitable, but we anticipate there will be improvement in that business.","On the Medicare Advantage side, we would try to be conservative and look at our membership growth. And we do think Medicare Advantage as an industry will continue to grow demographically with some penetration in the Medicare Advantage percentage as total of Medicare. And so we see that growing greater than 3%, but we haven\u2019t put estimates out there. I hope that helps when you are trying to get a trajectory of how we see the earnings over the coming few years.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Great. One point on Healthcare Services segment earnings, they have been better this year, is this a sustainable run rate to jump off of for next year or is\u2026?","Bruce Broussard","Yes. I think the investors should look at the Healthcare Services side as a correlation to how the growth is growing in the membership side, because what\u2019s happening is, as you are seeing strong growth in our home health business as a result of our Chronic Care program, you are seeing strong growth in our behavioral business because of both the duals growth and the business \u2013 and the Medicare side of the business. So there is some pricing up and down, obviously within the pharmacy business, that\u2019s got a little bit of a pricing up and down based on generics and specialty and so on. But in general there should be a proportional growth to Healthcare Services as our membership grows.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","Yes. Thank you. I wonder if you could just \u2013 I realized it\u2019s not a major driver for you guys, but the Florida Medicaid program, I am hoping you would just comment on what you are seeing, it\u2019s their early point now in terms of anything you can say about utilization levels as that new population comes into managed care?","Jim Murray","Sure. This is Jim. We have had Medicaid business in certain Florida regions for a long time, which are under risk based contracts. There are some new regions that we have in areas outside of South Florida that have just gotten up and running because of one of our competitor\u2019s recent announcements, we have been looking very closely at a lot of the medical spend and we don\u2019t see anything unusual. There is some hepatitis C spend in the Medicaid business, but recently Florida gave us what I will refer to as a kick payment, and the actuaries feel very comfortable with the amount of that payment relative to the Hep C costs that we are incurring as an organization. The Long-Term Support Services business is getting up and running and seeming to do very well. So we don\u2019t see any concerns relative to the Medicaid Florida business that we just recently started.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","And if I could just follow-up because you touched up on the Hep C, are you \u2013 can you just tell us where you might be with the various states that you are in or going into in terms of the potential for additional reimbursement for that, for what you are seeing now and maybe what you start to see at the end of the year?","Jim Murray","Sure. I have already spoken to Florida. Illinois has also agreed to fund our Hep C exposures and we are working with Virginia as respect to those. Some of portion of that in Virginia, it comes from the duals program and there is that funding related to Hep C cost is borne by CMS through a very complicated formula, but there is some exposure to us and we are working with the state of Virginia to walk them through what that is. Other than that, we feel very good about where we are at with all the state contracts.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David Windley - Jefferies","Hi. More generally on utilization, Brian mentioned in your prepared remarks that hospital admissions were down. I wondered if you could speak little more broadly to acute or in-patient acuity, average length of stay, metrics like that? And then also if the squeeze in inpatient is popping out in outpatient, could you talk about what you are seeing in the outpatient environment, from a utilization standpoint? Thanks.","Steve McCulley","Hey, David. This is Steve. I don\u2019t think there is a \u2013 we have seen any significant change in length of stay as we \u2013 as I think, Brian mentioned, we continue to see lower admissions, which is what we expected to see with our chronic care programs. The first quarter lower \u2013 the first quarter was very favorable and the second quarter was maybe not quite as favorable relative to the first, but it continues to be very favorable. And let me see your question, on the outpatient side, not a significant change, there is maybe some of that but not enough to \u2013 not something we would call unexpected.","David Windley - Jefferies","Okay, thank you.","Jim Murray","Broadly, I would say that we feel very good about our Medicare utilization trends.","David Windley - Jefferies","Thank you, Jim.","Jim Murray","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk high-level about the seasonality into the back half of the year here. I assume we could see some improvement in retail MLRs given Part D and exchange seasonality assuming normal seasonality employers well. And with that in mind, are the increased marketing costs going to mostly show up for the retail segment in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Steve McCulley","Hey, this is Steve. Let me see if I have those questions. The Part D seasonality is the same pattern that we have seen in the past. So, that\u2019s in our forecast as we model that out as people get into the coverage gap, then you see that play out and that\u2019s the normal seasonality we see. We do have more members into the reinsurance phase because of the Hep C and we have talked about that. And then on the exchange members, I think it\u2019s somewhat the inverse in that the deductibles that hit in the first quarter tend to make the early results better and then it kind of plays itself out through the year as people have met their deductibles. But again, the pattern changes aren\u2019t anything different than the normal patterns that we have experienced in the past. So, as we trend out, I mean, that\u2019s all considered in the guidance that we give.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Maybe just to follow up on that, I think a couple of your competitors suggested that as people hit the attachment points for the reinsurance on the exchange business, that kind of act similar to the donut hole and actually lowers MLRs into the second half of the year, is that your interpretation in the accounting?","Steve McCulley","Well, I think that \u2013 let me think about that, there maybe some effect to that, but I don\u2019t think, so far those people haven\u2019t hit those, those people who accumulate those balances as they go through the year. So, there is some modest impact from that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 it makes a drastic change in the overall MLR for the segment. As Jim mentioned, there is \u2013 it\u2019s only 5% of our revenue. So, there is some impact to that, but I don\u2019t have those numbers at my fingertips, but\u2026.","Jim Murray","We also have the factor in the risk corridor and that 80% of that dynamic that just was described\u2026","Steve McCulley","Yes, that\u2019s the other complexity. That\u2019s correct, Jim. So, to the extent that before they hit the reinsurance, it might be banging in the risk corridors and then as it moves and hits the reinsurance it kind of comes out of the corridors. So, all of that 3Rs tends to kind of smooth it out a little bit, so that the pattern really isn\u2019t as severe as it might otherwise be. Does that make sense?","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of A. J. Rice with UBS.","A. J. Rice - UBS","Hi, everybody. Maybe just two quick questions here. First, more of a strategic one, this is the year where Humana is growing MA much faster in enrollment than the peers and then the underlying market average. And I know Bruce coming into this year, you guys talked about some of the things you were doing to make that happen I guess. It sounds like you are making investment to go into new counties. I mean, do you see \u2013 we have other guys have a year of very fast growth and then they sort of pulled back and sort of consolidate that? Do you see this as sort of a period of time where you think Humana for an extended period of time will grow MA enrollment faster than the market?","Bruce Broussard","Well, I mean we haven\u2019t given any estimates on that. I think our \u2013 we continue to look at our value proposition and our value proposition with stable benefits and in the marketplace seems to continue to resonate well with the consumers. And so we are assuming we will continue to grow in the markets that we have strong density. And we are not adding much in geographic presence. I think what we are talking about is adding more HMO product, which allows us to provide a better product at the end of the day as a result of better quality, better relationships with our provider and in addition a better care model that helps us not only improve people\u2019s health, but at the same time manage the cost. So, we are bullish on Medicare Advantage, because of the out \u2013 I think because of what we see in the impact on the healthcare \u2013 on the healthcare costs and our value proposition, but we are not going to give you a very specific estimate of what we think our growth is over the coming years.","A. J. Rice - UBS","Okay. Maybe to switch gears on one more question on the exchange and your views about it going into 2015. CMS has put out there this auto enrollment feature and thinking about your membership, does that auto enrollment feature \u2013 is that a positive for you going into 2015? If you get a lot of people that end up reenrolling or just give me your thoughts on that proposal and how it might affect you?","Bruce Broussard","I think net-net we look at the auto enrollment as a positive, both in the auto enrollment and to exchanges and continuing that, but in addition, the auto enrollment also offers the enrollment into Medicare Advantage if we choose to that, so it really feeds both sides for us.","Regina Nethery","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial","Good morning. I actually just have a question around the accounting for the 3Rs and $575 million and $775 million it looks like the receivable was $240 million at the end of the quarter. I mean, how much has been \u2013 how much of that money has run through the P&L and sort of how are you expecting it to, how do you account for it in the back half of the year in terms of earnings?","Steve McCulley","Yes, I think we have said that through the first half of the year we have recorded $200 million and up $153 million of reinsurance and $87 million between the corridor and risk adjustment, but we also have a payable on our books for the contribution we have to pay into the reinsurance pool of $60 million in our trade accounts payable, but so that number is going to grow mainly as the reinsurance number that grows as we go from now to the end of the year and that number ends up being the $575 million to $775 million. So, when you say P&L, yes, I mean I think that is a stabilization program, so it does go through P&L, the offset of that entry. So, I am not sure if that answers your question.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial","Well, I guess what I am just trying to figure out is that how much has the earnings benefited thus far from that versus what\u2019s expected to come in, in the back half of the year?","Steve McCulley","Well, I think it would be the difference between whatever we have accrued year-to-date and the total that we have added to $575 million to $775 million. So, if we look to...","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial","$240 million is flowing through the P&L, right?","Steve McCulley","In the first half of the year, right. So, it would be some amount larger than that in the back half of the year. That gets you to between $575 million and $775 million. Yes, the receivable amount represents the P&L pickup that we get as a result of that program.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning. You laid out a lot of opportunities around the balance sheet in PBM, just wondering if you can help us think about timeframe for decisions, whether we should expect sort of one big decision that intertwines everything or if it\u2019s likely to be sort of piecemeal? And then along those lines, if you could just talk about MA, your appetite at this point and areas maybe that you would like to strengthen? Thanks.","Brian Kane","This is Brian. Let me take both questions. Well, relative to the timing, I would think of them as really separate processes of PBM from the capital deployment. PBM as Bruce mentioned is going to take some time and we are going to do a thorough analysis of what makes sense from a strategic perspective and from a financial perspective. In fact, if you look at some of the transactions in the industry that have taken place, this is a process that takes a good amount of time. And we are going to take the necessary time to get it right. And so I would say on the capital deployment side, that\u2019s something that we are spending a lot of time on as well. I would expect over the coming weeks and months we will have something more to say on that, probably more sooner than we would on the PBM.","With regard to MA, I think we are open to what may make sense strategically. I think we think about any kind of transaction that could enhance our Healthcare Services franchise that expands our technology capabilities. We look at different market based acquisitions, if there are opportunities on the MA side. We might think about a Medicaid acquisition if it makes sense from a price perspective and from a capability perspective. And so I think we are pretty open to thinking about our MA strategy here.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","Great. Thanks. I guess you are coming into the year, I think there was a lot of questions about whether the rapid enrollment growth is going to create a cost issue and obviously with the Q2 here, you are lowering your retail profitability, but not really because of a cost issue. So I wanted to do two things, if we could, just to understand what you did here on retail. First is, if I am saying this correctly, your new membership is coming on at a high cost but in line with expectation, but your core business is coming in maybe a little bit better, but if you could just kind of dig into those two dynamics of the existing membership versus new membership and what was driving that. And then the second, I don\u2019t fully understand why a managed care company would raise their SG&A guidance in sales and marketing costs, I would think that you come into the year, you have a pretty decent idea of what the budget should be. What causes you to go in and then say I am going to spend $20 million more or $30 million more on SG&A marketing at this point of the year versus where you thought you were going to be doing three, four months ago?","Jim Murray","Okay. This is Jim. I will talk about the first question. The first question, was around, I think you are correct, Kevin and that the new members do come in at a higher loss ratio, but we expect that. So they are coming in, they are tracking with kind of what we expected. The existing business is doing well and has been really overachieving, as we talked about investing in the clinical in the last quarter and that continues to track well. I am sorry, I went brain dead for a minute. The growth in the membership that we talked about in the first quarter looks really similar to what we have seen over the last several years. New members generally come in about 500 basis points higher in terms of their overall medical expense ratio. And that\u2019s playing itself out, even the Florida membership that some of you have talked about, is playing itself out in that manner. And over time what we see is that because of some of the things we do around the clinical programs as well as documentation relative to some of those newer members, over time they regress to the overall average and that seems on good track.","As respects to the marketing spend, I would tell you that over the last several years as we see how we do in the bids in terms of keeping our benefits stable and our premiums stable, and then in October when we see how we look relative to our competition, we have taken the opportunity to expand our spend prudently, because we think that there is a good opportunity for us to grow. And frankly after we got done with our bids this past year and we looked at what played itself out with some of the things we were able to do from a trend vendor perspective, we had a big discussion around the table. And we concluded that the wise thing to do would be to put away an extra amount of money for this year, because we see that there is a good opportunity for us to grow again next year. And I know that might make some of you crazy, but I think it\u2019s the right thing to ultimately do. We want to grow each and every year with Medicare. There is a tremendous opportunity with the aging population and so that\u2019s what we want to try to accomplish.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","I think we want to see you grow, I guess the question is in my mind that I was struggling with was just higher marketing spend signals something negative and that you feel like your benefits aren\u2019t as good as others, and therefore you need to do more marketing to get that membership or if it\u2019s \u2013 it sounds like you are saying it\u2019s opportunistic, and that you think you are doing better for now, so now it\u2019s just time to really ramp-up.","Jim Murray","Yes, if there were a major message that I were a single that I would take from this is that we feel pretty good about our ability to grow next year, and it\u2019s frankly a good sign.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","Alright. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the comments just on the small group margin compression that you are seeing from the transitional policies, I am just interested how much of a headwind you think this may be going into 2015, given that those transitional policies were extended. And then, Jim Murray, I know that you gave sort of a survey of the landscape on exchange in individual pricing that you are seeing, I am just wondering if you can do the same for us just on the small group with all the rate filings that have come out and what looks to be some pretty modest proposed increases in a number of the markets for us, small group for 2015? Thanks.","Jim Murray","Yes. Obviously, the transitional costs that Brian spoke to earlier was disappointing, because he had taken a shot of what we thought the impact was going to be and it turned out to be higher. The good thing about that, as many of you know, is that the small group block renews ratably over the course of the year. And so as we are seeing that issue play itself out, we are able to do some things with our pricing. There will probably be a little bit of a nick relative to what we thought six months ago in terms of what the small group line of business could produce in terms of profitability, because this was a little bit of a higher number than we anticipated. But we think that we can recover nicely from that.","As respects the competitive environment that exists in the small group space, we are growing very nicely in small group in spite of the fact that we are seeing \u2013 this was a kind of a neat dynamic that we are learning that about 5,000 of our small group members are transitioning into our HumanaOne offerings each and every quarter. And so in spite of the fact that some of the small group employers are beginning to shift some of their thinking around providing coverages and moving their employees to the exchange population, small group continues to grow nicely. And so the competitive landscape in small group looks okay to us right now. That could change, but I feel pretty good about that as we speak today.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Getting back to the exchange products that you have, do you plan to offer Platinum products next year. And then, why do you expect to not see your enrollment shrink on the exchanges, if you are going to have to pass-through price increases to cover what is fairly large reinsurance that\u2019s going to go away over the next couple of years?","Jim Murray","Again, this is Jim. Everybody will have to pass-through reinsurance costs. We are not any different than anybody else as respects reinsurance. We have a $45,000 attachment point. Everybody will have to have reinsurance as part of their pricing and some of what they experience, so each and every one of our competitors will have to put the wind down of reinsurance into their pricing. So that\u2019s not anything different than any of our competition.","As respects to the Platinum products, we have looked at what is developing with the Platinum products. In prior earnings calls I have talked about one of the large national actuarial firms talking about some of the risk adjustment mechanics that favor some of the folks who are chronically ill, and our Platinum product philosophy and strategy seems to be playing itself out just as we had anticipated in terms of the risk adjustment mechanism, as well as the reinsurance that supports the program. And so yes, we will continue to offer the Platinum programs. Part of the reason that we offer the Platinum I said earlier is, this aging channel for us in the Medicare space and it sets up nicely for us for the folks who are aging into the Medicare as well as we feel pretty good about our clinical chassis or capabilities as an organization and we are levering those for those folks who are chronically ill. And we think that there is a nice pricing dynamic that favors us as we focused on that Platinum product offering. And we think it\u2019s playing itself out very nicely.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes, but that gets to my point, because if you are getting more of the chronically ill and sicker people in the Platinum product, you would have more reinsurance. So, you have more to recover, because the reinsurance dynamic goes away in a couple of years?","Jim Murray","And that was the part of our pricing philosophy. Each and every one of our metal tiers had different philosophies relative to the amount of the reinsurance that is going to wind itself down. It wasn\u2019t averaged over the four tiers, it was ratable based upon the Platinum and we have put pricing on the Street relative to our Platinum offerings and we feel pretty good about how it positions us.","Bruce Broussard","I think the important point on the Platinum side is one of the capabilities of the organization is really to treat chronic members. You have seen this in the Medicare Advantage area. Now, you are seeing us take that same strategy over to the exchanges. The Platinum product does attract more chronic oriented members there, but what we are seeing both in the pricing and the analysis of the reinsurance is that the risk adjustment that is applied to those chronic members is actually helping in being able to make a solid offering, both because of the risk adjustment, but also because of our clinical capabilities in what \u2013 how we treat chronic members.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then on your \u2013 the rest of your commercial enrollment, can you talk about what you expect to see for 2015, I think we probably lost a sizable ASO account and talked about, if you would, what you are expecting for the overall book given what\u2019s going on with the small group and the ASO book?","Jim Murray","Sure. Part of our strategy as an organization that we aligned around last year was that over time in our group business, we ultimately want to focus on smaller case sizes from anywhere from 10 to 1000 in terms of the individual businesses that we insure. And so over time, you will see us continue to lose some of our self-funded business. I think we currently have I am going to guesstimate somewhere around 1 million or so self-funded larger companies that we provide services to. We are going to continue to price that business to make a profit. When we do that we are going to lose some of the business just like the one that you just referenced in the State of Kentucky. That book of business for us as many of you have known who have talked with us over the years on a fully loaded basis loses money. So, we are going to wind that down over time and shift our focus to fully insured case sizes, again, that are in the 10 to 1000 space. Where we think we can make a little bit more money and that seems to be playing itself out nicely in terms of some of the fully insured growth that we are seeing as an organization in those case sizes. We are losing some large fully insured cases, which also lose money, but you will see that happen over time and we will reposition the group block towards those \u2013 what we have referred to as our sweet spot.","Regina Nethery","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","Seeing that as much as 25% of the 8 million folks that are currently on the public exchange can\u2019t have their eligibility verified because of immigration of tax matters and so the public exchange membership still moving around. Is that your sense as well or do you feel you have a real handle on exactly what you have got in terms of public exchange enrollment?","Steve McCulley","Hey, Christine, this is Steve. I think we feel like we have a good handle on what we have. Obviously, we have only \u2013 we are acknowledging members that have paid their premiums and we have collected their premiums. So, I am not aware of any significant gap that we have.","Jim Murray","We have looked at how much membership we think will term over the course of the next year. I think we have been kind of conservative in terms of our term estimates, because this is a block of business that we are not as familiar with. But it seems like each month that through the first five months that we grew membership, about 75% to 80% of those folks paid their premiums and they continue to pay their premiums. And so we are learning more about the block over time, but as it respects to immigration status, I am not as familiar with things like that.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","And can you update us on your thoughts with respect to the Concentra Workers\u2019 Comp business? Thanks.","Jim Murray","Concentra\u2019s Workers\u2019 Comp business right now is doing very well relative to some of the targets that they have established for themselves. They are doing some nice things in terms of rate increases. The volumes that we are seeing on a regular basis are up slightly from where they were last year. But again, Concentra is a very small component of our overall book of business as an organization and as many of you have heard us talk over the last several months and quarters, some of what we are trying to do with that Concentra asset is to shift its focus more towards primary care as opposed to workers compensation and occupational medicine. And we are in the process of doing that, but the base business is performing well, but again, it\u2019s a small component of our overall results as a company.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just broadly speaking, I just want to confirm that I got your release right in that apart from the prior development Hep C costs and then for retail the public exchanges, the base business is performing well, you think? And is the MLR issue on both \u2013 or the deterioration is perhaps relative to consensus more, because of prior development in Hep C and probably more than PPD?","Steve McCulley","Hey, this is Steve. Let me see if I have your question right. So the \u2013 you are correct, we did have lower prior period development in the quarter compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. And that was really due to the fact that we paid a few retro claims for a number of issues. So, that suppressed our PPD into 2Q relative to maybe prior quarters. So, when you adjust the MLRs for that at both 1Q and 2Q, then the MLRs trend pretty comparably sequentially. So, I think that accounts for that, but you are correct, the base business is doing well. It continues to do well. The base Medicare business is doing well. And was there another question in there?","Jim Murray","The only thing that I would add to what Ana has talked about was that we also in the first quarter shared with the folks that we were going to invest $0.40 to $0.50 to invest in our clinical programs to set us up nicely for 2015. And then we grew pretty significantly probably 150,000 more MA members that we had anticipated and they come in at a higher MER, which although we are very pleased with the way they are developing. It does add a little bit of pressure to get it, but I guess it\u2019s a good \u2013 it\u2019s a high-class problem to have.","Steve McCulley","Good points. So, Ana, I think you are right. The Hep C is putting pressure on the benefit ratio like we said before as well as lower PPD. And what Jim just mentioned the investment in clinical also that we talked to last quarter was also in there.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners","And on the PPD, you said it was for several kind of issues, is it sort of a systemic thing you think that will carry forward to next year?","Jim Murray","No, it wasn\u2019t. There was some changes with respect to how we paced some \u2013 so market will change around some low volume hospitals and we reprocessed some old claims for that. There was another issue that caused us to reprocess small claims, not big dollars, $7 million or $8 million here and there. On the \u2013 over in the group side, we did process some higher \u2013 some transplant claims that went back to the fourth quarter that were a little higher than normal, but nothing major just that they all were all added up to a little bit and it shows itself in our lower PPD in 2Q, but that wouldn\u2019t \u2013 wouldn\u2019t expect it to continue going forward or be anything systemic.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners","Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful.","Jim Murray","Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup","Great, thanks. So, I was kind of estimating last quarter that the risk adjustment assumption for the individual business was maybe around $175 million, $0.60 a share. It sounded like your strategy at that point or the thought around it was that the big incumbents like the blues would pickup a lot on the healthier members and then new entrants like yourselves would pickup the less healthy members. Since then a number of the blues have come out and talked about worse than expected risk status on exchange, losing money, etcetera. So, do you think that \u2013 do you think the theory still holds that you guys will pickup, you picking up sicker members?","Steve McCulley","I think I will try that first and then Jim you can weigh in. This is Steve. Again, what we look at is the amount of our new business as a percentage in a state, because the risk adjustment is done by state. So, the percentage of ours that is \u2013 that hasn\u2019t been previously underwritten versus other plans will as they look at their block at their larger and they have been in the marketplace for a long time that they will have a higher percentage of their existing block that had been previously underwritten. What we said for the full year of the $775 million, that 75% of that was reinsurance. So 25% of that number was the risk adjustment and the risk corridor combined. So and again, whatever we \u2013 if we were to estimate today that the risk adjustment was going to be $100 million and it turned out to be something different, it would really just interplay with the risk corridor 80% of that. So there is kind of a governor on how far off we could be around that because the risk corridor at the end of the day that kind of sweeps everything in. So I don\u2019t think we are concerned. We have made \u2013 we believe we have made some reasonable estimates around the risk adjustment for the full year, but we don\u2019t think we have a lot of exposure for being wrong on that because of the way \u2013 the risk corridor is just a calculation, it\u2019s a math calculation, it doesn\u2019t really involve an estimate.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup","Got it. Are you saying the individual business is unprofitable enough relative to your expectations that the risk corridor will offset a piece of it?","Steve McCulley","Yes. So as we talked earlier in the year we have an investment in the exchanges this year and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing that to happen, and the 3Rs mitigate a fair amount of that. And as we price through \u201815 and \u201816, we expect to overcome that. And relative to the comment that you made about how we will be a net receiver of risk adjustment versus a net payer, again we talked last time about sophisticated models. We have looked at them at the blues plans in the markets that we participate in and their share relative to our share. And we feel pretty comfortable that because they had a significant amount of underwritten business that some element of that underwritten business in those spaces where they had heavy share went into the exchange population and would offset what we have in terms of our smaller share in those light states. And so we continue to feel pretty comfortable with the methodology that we have used to calculate the risk adjustment calculations. And then to somebody\u2019s earlier point, the Platinum offerings that we have offered create some of that risk adjustment receivables that Steve referenced.","Regina Nethery","And this is Regina. Just as a reminder we are not statewide in the states either as opposed to some of the blues are clearly more broad-based in their geographic presence.","Jim Murray","And then maybe speaking to their original estimates as opposed to where they are today, so. I think that was the last question, is that correct Regina?","Regina Nethery","That is correct.","Bruce Broussard - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we appreciate everyone\u2019 support and I thought it would be helpful maybe just to summarize a few aspects about where Humana is. I first have to say that the Medicare membership growth as you look at it this year was a concern of the investors starting in late fall of last year. And I think the organization has proven that its clinical capabilities can not only overcome the rate reductions that have happened as a result of Medicare, the cuts, but in addition has been able to handle the Medicare \u2013 significant Medicare growth. I know that was a question and a concern for the investors and hopefully you take that away this second quarter.","Secondarily the duals are on target. From a utilization point of view, we are a little far behind, not because of our execution but because of the state delays. But we continue to be a big believer in that business as each one of you know, it\u2019s a $300 billion business and it\u2019s going to be a large growth sector for the organization and our participation in that leverages our chronic capabilities and our ability to take care of members that are in need of health treatment. Our exchange growth was strong this year as evident by our growth and from our base business we have set a goal to breakeven in 2015, during 2015 and we also are very conscious of working through the phase out of the 2Rs and our strategy reflects both to have a profitable business that is at market rate margins and at the same time to be able to not be dependent on the 2Rs as they phase out.","In addition, the investors have constantly questioned us about our capital structure and the efficiency of our capital this quarter, we have outlined that we are taking that under advisement and we are reviewing both the PBM and the efficiency of the PBM as it is structured today as an in-house PBM and can we find other ways to make that more efficient. And then in addition, as Brian articulate, we are also focusing on the capital structure and how we can adjust that. We have a very positive outlook and as we look at the feature for the organization and Medicare specifically as the rate reductions from ACA are phasing out. And we think that there will be more clarity over time in the Medicare rates going forward.","In result, we are investing this year in 2014 and that is being reflected in our forecast for the remaining year why we are not over performing but meeting expectations as we think that our membership growth, the clarity of 2014 is a good base to build from and it allows us to also invest in clinical marketing programs to set us out for 2015. So in closing, we thank everyone for their support. We appreciate you guys on a quarterly basis of being an investor in the organization. And we look for your support in the coming quarters and like always you always we couldn\u2019t do this without thanking our 54,000 associates that are dedicated to both our success but our members\u2019 success. So thank you. And everyone have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for joining the second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

We are pleased with our 2019 performance, particularly our success in balancing and executing on multiple priorities as we grew membership, improve the quality and productivity of our operations, and continued to invest in the long-term.","During 2019, we experienced significant membership growth in both Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, where we were able to serve our country's sickest and most vulnerable population in need of quality care and better health outcomes. For individual Medicare Advantage, we saw the highest growth we've seen in a decade with over a half a million seniors choosing Humana MA plans. In addition, we have a record number of MA members in 4-star and higher plans.","Our Medicaid membership grew nearly 38% with our statewide Florida win for 2019, and we added approximately 140,000 members on January 1, 2020 under our Kentucky Medicaid contract that was previously fully ceded to CareSource. We also demonstrated the strength of our Medicaid capabilities through procurements, expanded our senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, significantly advanced our home health capabilities, expanded our pharmacy operations, and took significant initial steps towards creating an interoperable health ecosystem via technology partnerships.","As we begin to scale our clinical solutions in 2020, we are continuing to balance our strategic initiatives across five key areas of influence on a member\u2019s health journey, primary care, home, pharmacy, social determinants of health, and behavioral. Let me give you an update on the recent progression in some of these areas. In 2019, we opened 29 senior-focused primary care centers under our wholly-owned Alliance and JV model, bringing our center total to 262, and we continue to see the maturity of our value-based care platform resulting in more providers in surplus, and improve the operating performance of our legacy Conviva operations.","We are now evolving from proof-of-concept to scaling these senior-focused, value-based primary care assets. And just this week, we announced an exciting strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson, & Stowe that will accelerate our payor-agnostic center expansion, giving more seniors access to quality primary care built around their unique health needs, especially in geographies that lack the access today.","WCAS is an important strategic partner in Humana\u2019s journey of building an omni-channel, senior-focused consumer platform, and this new arrangement is a capital efficient approach to rapid expansion. WCAS, together with Humana has committed approximately $600 million to create a joint venture that is expected to open a minimum of 50 payor-agnostic, senior-focused primary care centers over three years, beginning in 2020.","WCAS will maintain majority ownership and Partners in Primary Care will manage the centers for a management fee. Similar to our innovative deal to acquire Kindred at Home, put and call options provide Partners in Primary Care with a path to full ownership of the centers in five to 10 years. We are excited to be able to work with WCAS to facilitate faster entry into additional community in need of senior-focused primary care. We are also expanding our JV and Alliance model and expect to add 35 centers in 2020 with these important partners.","Today, we serve over a quarter of a million of our individual MA members in our owned JV and Alliance model. Our goal is to double the number of members served in this model over the next several years. Our pharmacy operations just completed the acquisition of Enclara Healthcare, one of the nation's largest hospital benefit -- pharmacy and benefit management organizations.","This acquisition provides Humana Pharmacy the opportunity to expand our comprehensive care continuum strategy to cover the pharmacy-related needs associated with hospice care, simplify the mail order pharmacy experience and advance the technology stack for in-home pharmacy through areas such as enhanced mobile medication management and improved electronic medical record connectivity.","In the home, we advanced our transformational home health initiative with Kindred at Home and Curo through the implementation of a company-wide EMR and the extrapolation of best practices for our [indiscernible] over 20,000 home health episodes.","The next phase beginning in 2020 is to provide more care services in the home, including acute care and primary care in the home, so that we may begin to generate meaningful trend vendors for our health plans in the future while improving clinical outcomes for our seniors.","We remain committed to improving the life of those we serve through our social determinants capabilities, which positions us strongly to serve the vulnerable populations, Medicare and Medicaid and provide us with the experience needed to meaningfully participate in the MA value-based insurance design program and Medicaid procurements.","In 2019, we scaled social determinants of health screenings to over 1 million more than double the number of screenings in 2018 and connected those in need to community resources. We will continue to expand our outreach and services around social determinants of health in 2020 and beyond.","Lastly, recognizing that healthcare continues to evolve, and technology will be at the forefront of the evolution, we announced two key strategic partnerships in 2019 with Microsoft and Epic to leverage technology to develop a health ecosystem that enables a seamless and integrated experience.","Our focus in 2020 will be migration to the cloud to enable interoperability and agility. In addition, we are seeing nice uptick in provider engagement on Compass, our population health delivery platform, and a higher direct-to-consumer sales completions in our digital, virtual, intelligent plan recommendation tool as compared to our standard online enrollment tool.","We've also seen that members who use the virtual recommendation tool are significantly more likely to share their health information with us in ways that could improve their decision making and help us better onboard and engage clinically once they are enrolled.","As a Company, we continue to emphasize the enduring need to drive efficiency and productivity across the organization, while not losing focus on the key themes of providing a simpler experience for our customers and delivering better health outcomes.","As we discussed last quarter, the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2020 posed a significant headwind for the industry, reinforcing this need to drive productivity. As Brian will describe, we work diligently to identify ways to improve our cost structure by leveraging technology to streamline processes and executing a reduction in our workforce, including redeployment of individuals to open positions, which impacted approximately 2,000 jobs.","While we were able to drive meaningful savings, it was not an easy task and there are still members who experienced an increase in premium or reduction in benefits for 2020, given the magnitude of the HIF. Given the significance of the headwind, particularly the $2.10 headwind from the non-deductibility of the HIF, we are pleased to be provide the initial adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $18.25 to $18.75, representing reasonable growth while also delivering solid expected MA membership growth.","We expect to add 270,000 to 330,000 individual MA members in 2020, representing growth of approximately 7.5% to 9.2%, which we believe at a minimum will be in line with the industry growth. These expected results reflect balanced growth across all segments, with each segment projected to deliver meaningful pretax or EBITDA growth in 2020. Brian will provide more detailed segment level guidance in his remarks.","As we have discussed previously, given the HIF as a premium-based fee, beneficiaries and Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, the sicker and most vulnerable populations are disproportionately taxed. Despite that, seniors continue to increasingly choose Medicare Advantage over original Medicare.","With compelling individual MA industry growth of 8.7% in 2019, excluding the impact of cost plans, compared to 7.2% in 2018 and 6.1% in 2017, MA penetration continues to increase reaching 34% in 2019. And 2020 industry growth is expected to keep pace with 2019 even with the return of the HIF, a testament to the value the MA program provides and a model for other potential public, private partnerships for additional populations needing affordable healthcare.","Accordingly, we are pleased that Congress waived the fee beginning in 2021, recognizing that the imposition of the HIF falls disproportionate on Medicare beneficiaries and reduces affordability. The permanent repeal of the HIF is a significant win for consumers and we appreciate \u2013 appreciative of the strong bipartisan support to repeal it.","Looking ahead, we are committed to delivering strong short-term performance while investing in transformative capabilities for the long-term sustainability of the company.","To that end, we will continue to stay focused on three key priorities; expanding our local presence with primary care centers, the home and value-based partnership models, modernizing our digital and analytics infrastructure, including cloud migration, interoperability and the creation of a longitudinal health record and developing an enterprise clinical operating model built on technology and analytics to integrate our clinical assets focused on patient centered care and disease specific best practices.","In closing, I want to personally thank our associates for their dedication to our strategy and operational excellence. We are pleased that because of their exemplary efforts and our success in 2019, including improved net promoter score, significantly individual MA membership growth and adjusted EPS growth in excess of our long-term target, we are able to reward our associates with higher incentive-based compensation.","Our associates continued to demonstrate world-class engagement, which manifest and a better experience for our customers leading to a long-term sustainability for the company.","Over the next year, we expect political discussion to continue to focus on healthcare and results in market volatility. However, we are confident in the Medicare Advantage program, which has significant bipartisan support and our opportunity to be part of the solution to both addressing the rising cost of healthcare and the need for quality outcomes.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Kane","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $2.28 for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $17.87 for the full-year, ahead of our previous expectations. This represents a 23% increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year. These 2019 results led by industry-leading individual, Medicare Advantage membership growth and better than expected MA utilization provide positive momentum going into 2020.","We expect 2020 to be another strong year for the company with solid top and bottom line growth, notwithstanding the return of the health insurance fee or HIF, which is not deductible for tax purposes.","As I discussed our 2019 results, and our expectations for 2020 this morning, I encourage you to reference the waterfall slide provided on our Investor Relations website with the webcast materials.","As outlined in the waterfall, we expect a 2020 adjusted EPS range of $18.25 to $18.75, which is consistent with our commentary last quarter. We believe we struck the appropriate balance between top and bottom line growth, while investing for long-term sustainability as we contemplated our 2020 pricing, recognizing the significant impact of the return of the non-deductible health insurance fee, of which the after-tax portion alone is worth $2.10 for the year.","Our strong Medicare Advantage growth in both individual and group MA is driving our 2020 consolidated revenue growth of approximately 14% at the midpoint of our revenue guidance of $73.9 billion to $74.5 billion. And we are forecasting strong and balanced pretax and EBITDA growth across our three reporting segments.","Additionally, as we contemplate the quarterly progression of earnings in 2020, we expect the first quarter to contribute a bit more than 24% of the annual total, which contemplates unusually high workday seasonality in the quarter, primarily due to 2020 being a leap year.","Before discussing the segment results, I would like to echo what Bruce said in his remarks regarding the exemplary performance of our associates this past year. We are pleased that we were able to reward our associates with higher incentive-based compensation given the outperformance in 2019, aligning our associates' compensation with the exceptional value they provide for our customers, providers, and shareholders.","An important part of the work our team accomplished during 2019 was to drive significant productivity savings, which took a great deal of effort and necessitated difficult decisions. These important initiatives are part of our longer journey to drive cost efficiency over the last number of years.","In fact, when you exclude approximately 170 basis points for the impact of the HIF in 2020, the midpoint of our guidance range for the operating cost ratio is 10.3%, down 110 basis points versus last year. Even when you exclude the incremental investments made in 2019 that increased our operating cost ratio, the 2020 midpoint adjusted to exclude the HIF still demonstrates 70 basis points of improvement over the 11% midpoint of our initial guide for 2019.","This improvement continues to compelling efficiency gains driven over the last five years, freeing up resources to help mitigate the impact on premiums and benefits for our members due to the return of the HIF, while also driving solid earnings growth and enabling us to invest in critical strategic areas.","I will now turn to segment results and as I do, I will touch briefly on 2019 and then transition to how we are improving operating results in 2020. I will begin with the Retail segment.","In 2019, we saw industry-leading individual Medicare Advantage growth of approximately 525,000 members. The highest growth we have seen in a decade. We also experienced considerably lower utilization in Medicare Advantage than our expectations, which allowed us to end 2019 with a benefit ratio for the Retail segment 70 basis points below the midpoint of our initial guidance for the year.","We have now experienced multiple years of declining inpatient admissions for 1,000 members for APTs in Medicare Advantage, driven primarily by better health outcomes from our clinical programs coupled with well-controlled outpatient. physician and pharmacy trends.","The 2019 improvement allowed us to invest this outperformance into our 2020 bids, which when coupled with our productivity efforts will enable us to grow our individual MA book at the market growth rate at a minimum. This is something we are quite proud of given the material headwinds we faced in 2020 and after coming off an exceptional growth year in 2019.","Our group MA business continues to perform well and we expect to grow group MA membership by approximately 90,000 members or 17% in 2020, primarily driven by the addition of a large group account from a competitor.","As you know, group MA membership growth can vary widely from year-to-year based on the pipeline of opportunities, particularly large accounts going out to bid. We believe we are well positioned to capture these opportunities as they arise.","For our standalone PDP business, in 2019, we experienced a second consecutive year of significant declines in membership as we no longer were the low price plan in any market. As we've discussed previously, this business is exceedingly price competitive with a winner take all dynamic.","Accordingly, as you are aware, we made important changes in 2020, repositioning our PDP products to allow us to once again have the low price offering in most markets. Our new low price Humana Walmart Value Rx Plan is seeing nice growth in 2020, in line with expectations.","However, this growth is not enough to overcome the significant losses we are seeing in our Premier Rx Plan, where most members experienced a significant increase in Premium in 2020 because of our plan design changes caused by the three plan limit imposed by CMS and an aging population with more chronic conditions and higher pharmacy costs.","Based on the final results of AEP, our expectations for 2020 PDP membership losses have improved relative to our prior guidance, and we now expect to lose approximately 550,000 members compared to our previous estimate of approximately 600,000.","While these losses are modestly higher than initially expected at the time of bids, the planned changes we made in 2020 were necessary to attract a balanced risk pool and stem the membership losses in our book going forward.","Lastly, our Medicaid business continues to perform well and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for this business. Effective 1\/1\/2020, we added approximately 140,000 members under the existing Kentucky Medicaid contract previously ceded to CareSource.","We are pleased to be serving Medicaid members in Kentucky, Florida, and Illinois in 2020. We look forward to the final resolution of both the Kentucky and Louisiana procurements where the award of both contracts demonstrated our strong Medicaid capabilities.","All in, the Retail segment is expected to show strong operating improvement as demonstrated in the waterfall, contributing an incremental $1.66 to adjusted EPS when you adjust for the reinvestment of approximately $0.70 of Retail outperformance from the first half of 2019 in the bids for 2020 to help offset the impact of the HIF.","While our Retail segment outperformed in 2019, our Group and Specialty segment did not perform well and we are taking the opportunity to significantly reposition the segment in 2020 and beyond.","The segment faced a number of pressures, including membership migration out of our community-rated product into a level funded ASO, which drove unexpected average selection in our community-rated block resulting in significant negative prior period development.","Note that this negative prior period development also adversely impacted the starting cost baseline for 2020, given the unanticipated morbidity mix. Using our consistent historical reserving practices for the Group and Specialty segment, we acknowledged the negative prior year claims development we experienced in 2019 as we contemplated the adequacy of reserves as of December 31, 2019.","The segment also experienced large numbers of provider settlements, IT system upgrades for the Insurance and Specialty businesses and investments in market infrastructure.","Our core trend remains stable and we believe the investments we are making in systems and people will position the segment for growth in 2020 and beyond. Accordingly, we expect the segment to contribute approximately $0.55 of incremental adjusted EPS to the enterprise for 2020.","For Healthcare Services, we had a strong year as we saw growth in our pharmacy business, solid performance of Kindred at Home and continued improvement in our Conviva operations, partially offset by the cost incurred to continue to expand our owned JV and Alliance senior-focused primary care centers.","Notwithstanding the significant PDP membership losses, our pharmacy script volume grew year-over-year primarily due to higher Medicare Advantage and state-based contract membership. For 2020, despite the expected PDP membership decline, we anticipate strong EBITDA growth in the pharmacy business.","As Bruce mentioned, we recently closed the Enclara transaction, expanding our hospice pharmacy capabilities. Our home business is also anticipated to perform well led by Kindred at Home in which the conversion to Homecare Homebase across home health and hospice in 2019 weighed on results due to the significant required one-time investment, but will drive EBITDA in 2020 notwithstanding the adoption of the new payment methodology, PDGM.","And in our provider businesses, as Bruce described, we are working to meaningfully scale this opportunity and are very excited about the recently announced innovative venture with Welsh Carson to open a minimum of 50 additional payor-agnostic, senior-focused primary care centers over the next three years, which we managed by our Partners in Primary Care team under the Partners in Primary Care brand.","Finally, our Conviva Primary Care business is expected to continue improving its core operating performance. As a result of all these efforts, we expect meaningful year-over-year Healthcare Services adjusted EBITDA growth to contribute an incremental $1.03 to adjusted EPS.","Turning to cash flow and capital deployment. Our operating cash flow was a record $5.3 billion in 2019, reflecting strong earnings and the benefit of a significant membership growth we experienced for individual Medicare Advantage. In periods of increasing enrollment, operating cash flows are positively impacted because premiums are collected in advance of claims by a period of up to several months.","While we expect solid MA membership growth in 2020, due to the significant membership increase we experienced in 2019 and timing of the related premium collections and claim payments as well as other working capital items, we expect our operating cash flows for 2020 to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. ","Additionally, as we've demonstrated with the various transactions we have pursued, we will continue to deploy our capital in an efficient manner with a target debt to capitalization ratio of 35% in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating with the ability to move higher than that for strategic M&A.","Finally, our initial guidance for 2020 includes an assumption of some share repurchase in the back half of 2020 and our strategic M&A priorities remain the same, including the continued build out of our Healthcare Services capabilities to drive our integrated care model as well as tactical health plan acquisitions to the extent they become actionable.","With that, we will open the lines up to your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks for taking the questions. As we think further out maybe and obviously you've given us the outlook here for 2020, growth remains strong here, and you continue to look further to invest.","Maybe two questions real quick. First in retail, as we think about investing the HIF money in the future, how do you think \u2013 how much do you think that should we consider either being really driven for growth versus maybe some of that coming back into earnings?","And then secondly, you're talking about expanding your primary care footprint here. Can you give us a little bit more color on how your Partners in Primary Care efforts are going? You say it's sort of not going to be really impactful to 2020, but when would you expect that to really start have a more meaningful impact to the bottom line? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Well, good morning, Charles. So let me take them in order. First with regard to the HIF in 2021, as we've said in prior settings, it's obviously early to be commenting on 2021. We do believe that the health insurance fee repeal will be a significant benefit to our customers and we would expect them to see increased benefits on account of that.","But we will balance as we always do membership growth with EPS as well as making sure we invest for long-term sustainability. And so, you'll see us continue to invest in our integrated care model as we balance top and bottom line growth.","I would also say as we think about 2021, and I know \u2013 and this has been a topic of conversation, we\u2019ll make sure we understand the impact of ESRD. We need to obviously see where the rate notice ultimately comes out, and that's something that we're obviously eerily anticipating.","And then also, we'll need to gain theory out what we think our competitors do with respect to the HIF repeal in 2021. But overall, we obviously are bullish on 2021, but it's really too early to provide specifics.","On the second question with regard to primary care. We feel very good about our primary care capabilities. In fact both our Conviva operations, which are performing nicely and we're seeing good operational turnaround, but also the business we're expanding Partners in Primary Care, we believe has an operating model that can be replicable and scalable across multiple markets in the U.S., and so it's really a function of how do you fund this expansion.","There's a significant J-curve in these clinics, meaning that for the first few years, they lose EBITDA, they lose money. And then over time, they begin to make money and actually earn a nice return on investment. And so how do we bridge that gap? And so partnering with Welsh Carson, who's an expert in health care and very, very good at what they do, we believe that we\u2019ll be able to scale this model very efficiently and really get us the capital we need to tie us over between where the J-curve period where we're losing money to where we can bring these back on balance sheet if we decide to do that when they're more profitable.","Bruce Broussard","All right. Just to add to Brian's comment, we do see benefit from the clinics early on, on the insurance side. So, if you think about the contribution to the company, there's really two parts to it, which is the actual centers themselves. And then the second part is enhancing and moving members more and more to value-based payment models, which we see better star score, we see lower MER, and we also see better satisfaction there.","So as Brian articulated, in the J-curve side, you'll see it more on the insurance side as it grows. It continues to be on the insurance side, but then it becomes more on the clinic side. So in 2020, we will see benefits from these clinics, and we \u2013 in the 200 and some we have, we\u2019ve seen benefits all along, but you'll see it more on the insurance side and more in the \u2013 as we referenced in trend benders as opposed to see it in the actual profitability of the centers themselves.","Charles Rhyee","So basically you're able to direct your members to the primary care centers that you have. And is that \u2013 when you're recruiting physicians for these centers, are you bringing physicians that already have full patient panels themselves? Or are you kind of recruiting doctors who are interested in changing the way they practice in general and\u2026?","Bruce Broussard","Yes. Most of these, on exceptions, we will bring some physicians that have patients, but the majority of them will be starting from scratch. And that's really the reason for the J-curve as what Brian was talking about.","In reference to steering the patients there, we really \u2013 our design plan is to make it affordable for people to choose the clinics, but obviously it's their choice, and they're - from a \u2013 to choose their physician.","But we do find in areas where we locate and where they don't have primary care or hospital that we are the sort of the community choice there. So I would just emphasize both from plan and where we locate them is an important part of how our members choose them.","Amy Smith","And Charles was a great example of getting a lot of questions in. Please remember to limit yourself to one question. Introduce the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Hi everybody. I might just continue to just try to flesh out the strategy around these Partners in Primary Care. With this deal, will the growth all be in this joint venture or can you continue to do ones on your own or with other third parties? And is there any restriction around the risk sharing?","I know that's been a big part of the long-term targeted savings for the health plan is to do risk sharing with these. Is there any restrictions given its payor-agnostic on what you can do there? And then maybe another thing you didn't mention is, once you get the 50 up and running, how much of your Humana MA book will be covered by one of the \u2013 or have access to one of these clinics?","Brian Kane","Yes, let me try to go in reverse order. It'll still be a relatively small portion of our MA book, which is the reason why, what Bruce said, we want to scale these up as quickly as we can, but it still will be a relatively small portion of our book. Remember, from a risk perspective, each \u2013 from a risk member perspective, each clinic has about 2,200 or so risk members kind of varies depending on the size, could be as low as 1,500, could go to 2,500 members. And so you can do the math. It's still relatively small, which is why it's important that we take a balanced approach to our growth.","Really going to your first question, we have partnerships with a number of players. They're very valuable partners that we will continue to expand with. Some we have equity investments in, some we do not. But we'll look to continue to expand those joint venture and Alliance models. But we have, I would say the ability to expand as we see fit to continue to grow this footprint, which we will do. We're obviously very mindful of the impacts on the income statement when we do this. So we're trying to be creative with the use of our capital, but I would tell you that we have flexibility to execute our business plan.","And then on the risk sharing side, being payor-agnostic is really important. It's important so that we can actually fill up these clinics. It's important so we can attract physicians. It's important to be able to really create the best-in-class experience for our members and to give them the ultimate choice \u2013 of the patients to give them the ultimate choice what they need in their lives.","But there's no restrictions with respect to risk sharing or the like. Obviously, each risk contract is different and sometimes there are path to risk contracts. So it may not go full risk day-one, but generally we sign at least path to risk deals with the various payors. But we're encouraged by the reception that we've seen from other payors and we're committed to making this payor-agnostic. ","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Peter Costa","Good morning, everybody. Sort of on the same line, focusing on the Partners in Primary Care transaction. One of your competitors, when your large competitors buys larger practices, physician practices and other, your larger competitors doesn't buy practices at all or run them and uses contracts and there's this mattering of that across the board.","You guys seem to be the ones trying to grow practices and you struggled with that, whether it would be Conviva that has gone through a turnaround. Concentra was never really grew the way you wanted it to. And now with Partners in Primary Care, it seems like you're pushing that off your books from an earnings perspective here in the short-term while it grows, can you explain why you still think this is the right strategy versus what your competitors are doing?","Bruce Broussard","Yes, I would maybe try to put those in boxes. Let me start with Concentra. I think Concentra was an urgent care model that had a small primary care part to it. We ended up doing \u2013 actually, the Genesis to Partners in Primary Care is out of Concentra. And so what we did is we bought the company, then pulled the primary care out of it and then began the Partners in Primary Care. So that transaction, we didn't want to be in the urgent care business going forward.","Conviva, actually is interesting because Conviva today is probably one of the larger organizations in the country that has pure clinics with senior-focused. It's got 200 and some thousand Medicare Advantage lives in it and it's performing well. And when we talk about turnaround, it's really more bringing in the various different brands that were in South Florida and creating a brand \u2013 one of which that brand, some of those brands had been within the organization since 2008, 2009 in that arena.","So what you see is more making it a better brand, a holistic brand and growing and continuing to serve the organization well on the insurance side as good star scores, as good MER, as good satisfaction and growth. And so I wouldn't make either one of those as the organization as sort of shunning or in and out of this. I would say there is a philosophy difference between us and others in the country that you are referencing. And our philosophy is, is the buying primary care and trying to convert them to Medicare Advantage value-based care model is a highly risky proposition, and we've seen over the years that organizations that have tried to do that have not been totally successful.","Now if you're going to keep them fee-for-service, you're going to keep them commercial, if you're going to keep them in that vein, I think you\u2019re going to be quite successful on and not having to deal with the change management. What you do see the organization doing is going through sort of stages with that. I think the first stage was around, does this work for Partners in Primary Care?","And we've been testing and learning that for the last few years and we've come to the conclusion seeing the results that we've had in the markets we've opened. That this is really working. We're seeing great star scores. As I mentioned, we're seeing great satisfaction scores where we\u2019re being able to recruit doctors into it, we're able to fill them up in the time that we thought.","So the real question is how do we scale it? And so we've tried to scale it over the years through joint venture partnerships. And you've seen today we have 260 some clinics and serving about 10% or so about our members. And now it's just a question of scaling. And so what we chose is to scale it in a way that we can utilize in a capital efficient way to be able to do it, be able to set it as an independent entity, but still have control over and over a period of time and be able to use that as a growth vehicle for us. But at the same time continuing to scale through our joint venture and Alliance partners that we've done in the past. ","So I think what you'll see is it\u2019s more of a scale question as opposed to anything else. And it's a question of how do we build a great base for this? And I feel that the company has matured in a way that is very bullish on this, but at the same time matured in a way to test and learn because of you articulating in different ways. Owning and operating physicians is a very, very difficult task at times and it is also a risky task and we've tried to navigate through this to ensure that the organization is able to both succeed, but more importantly scale this because of the end results.","Amy Smith","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on margins. Just first, can you give us an idea of where Medicare Advantage kind of settles out? I know you don't want to give specifics, but just relative to the 4.5% to 5%, how close are we there? And also kind of how should we think about it in 2021 if you are going to reinvest some of the HIF? Is the next move downward in those margins?","And then just in terms of the healthcare services business, same thing, margins really strong there looking like in the guide, is that all just improvement in those ancillary businesses that you kind of outlined? And if so, where do you kind of see the trajectory of those going forward from here? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Good morning, Justin. On the MA side, I would say for 2019, we finished a little bit below our 4.5% to 5% margin, obviously a really strong year given where we started the year. For 2020, as I mentioned in my remarks and we've discussed in the past, we invested some of that outperformance into in 2019 into our 2020 bids. And so obviously that's going to impact margins, but then we obviously have improved the operations as well. So all in, I would say the margins are relatively flat year-over-year 2020 versus 2019. And so we're still a bit below the 4.5% to 5%.","With respect to 2021, again, really too early to get 2021, but it's fair to say whenever there's that tax impact on the after-tax line, you can see the geography of where the earning shows up, changes a little bit. So it's conceivable that that we do have a decrease in margins for 2021 while obviously still growing EPS very nicely. So that's something we would have to work through. But typically that is a dynamic that's at play when we've seen tax rates change dramatically, whether because of the HIF or because of tax reform that occurred in 2018.","On the Healthcare Services side, I would describe it as balanced growth. I think we feel very good about really all segments. The pharmacy side is showing a really nice improvement year-over-year. They continue to drive penetration on the mail order side, on the specialty side as well as we think the Enclara opportunity on the hospice side, we'll give them some runway as well. Kindred at Home is also performing well. We hope to continue to see strong EBITDA growth, not withstanding the change in the payment model.","As you know, we've embraced this payment model because it gets us closer to chronic nursing versus solely focused on therapy. But I think that the team is doing a really nice job of mitigating any impacts there and also leveraging the benefits of implementing Homecare Homebase. And as Bruce discussed on our primary care business, both Conviva and Partners in Primary Care, we see a nice turnaround there, particularly in Conviva, which is entirely on balance sheet. We're seeing real improvement in the EBITDA performance. So really I think it's a real positive story on Healthcare Services and we hope that continues in the years ahead.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Styblo","Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s David Styblo in for Dave Windley. I wanted to ask a question about that group and specialty business. Just kind of looking at the bridge here, it looks like there's about a $0.55 tailwind for 2020 that you called out. I'm curious how much of that is from the absence of one-time costs that happened in 2019 or settlements versus improvements in the core business and then more broadly related to that business? How does commercial fit into the broader portfolio just given the fits and challenges that that business has gone through?","Brian Kane","Yes. I would say it\u2019s \u2013 on your first question, it's really a balance. Clearly we don't have the repetition of one-time items, but some of it is also improvement in the core business, some of the pricing actions that we've taken. I think it's important and we expect to hope to have gotten the baseline right.","As I mentioned in my remarks, the average selection we saw in our book really hurt the 2019 performance because 2018 backed up. You sort of have a double whammy there. You have the 18 hit and then you're trending off the wrong baseline for 2019. So I think I'm hopeful we've gotten that right. We'll obviously see what happens in the coming months here. So I think it's really a combination of core improvement as well as the one timers not repeating.","Really to your second question, we continue to invest in this business that's also weighing on the results for 2020. In other words, the results would have been higher not for that. We believe that there is a real opportunity to grow this business, become more of a player, a significant player in particular markets where we're strong in Medicare and where we think really, number one, there's an opportunity to drive more relevance with our providers. And we think when we have a commercial presence, particularly moving up market away solely from the small group and moving into the mid group and sort of larger group side, not the jumbo side, but more large group gives us the attention of the providers in the local markets.","We also think there is a significant cross-sell opportunity as members\u2019 age into Medicare. And also on the group MA side, it's an area where our competitors have done a very nice job, leveraging their commercial business because we don't have that same commercial business. It's hard for us to get those synergies. And so we think there are opportunities there.","And then the final thing I would say is our specialty business is something that we don't talk a lot about, but we're bullish on it and we really hope to grow it both on the group side and also on the individual side. It's a business that has low capital requirements and good margins. And so we think we continue to grow that and cross-sell that product. So for those reasons, we're committed to the business and we're hopeful for a better year this year in 2020.","Bruce Broussard","Just to add to Brian, I think just to emphasize, we realized that having a national strategy and commercial is just as \u2013 is not the right direction here. And so we are picking markets where today we are strong and utilizing those markets to continue to build our local presence and commercial is of those along with the other assets that we have. And so you see a much more concentrated effort.","Obviously, as what Brian has talked about in 2019 was a rough year for the commercial business for a whole host of reasons. But we do believe in certain markets that make sense to have a commercial product and that's what you see the team oriented to, but we need to make sure our infrastructure is prepared for that, and that's what you see a lot of the investments and the work going on in 2019.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. Just trying to get a little bit better understanding of some of the non-repeat items that are going on here, so you guys talked about negative prior period development related to the Group business, but you can't tell on the press release, it looks like for total [quotes] net positive.","So how much negative group development was there? What would MLR have done without it? And then as we think about other non-repeating items that are occurring in 2020, is there any carrying costs related to Louisiana and then is there any startup costs related to what you guys are doing on the provider JV side that wouldn't continue as we think about run rate earnings?","Brian Kane","Good morning, Sarah. So I would \u2013 you could see in our press releases as a breakout between Group PPD and Retail. So Group has gotten HIF for the reasons I talked about Retail, as modestly positive, I think it was a good year for PPD for retail, obviously less so for Group.","So that that is a \u2013 I would call that a one-time item on the \u2013 I hope it's a one-time item on the negative PPD side for Group. So I think that's one example. There are some modest startup costs in Louisiana. We have to plan for that. So that is in our numbers and our costs. So we've obviously scaled up to be ready for that.","Again it's something we're very proud of the Medicaid team has done just a fabulous job winning that contract and we'll see where it goes. But we feel good about that. And so it's important that we make sure we are ready to implement that contract, when and if we get, we get that finalized and officially awarded.","There are a few other things on the JV side, but a lot of those costs are going to come off, our 2020 income statement, because of the partnership that we announced. They're still, some of that because not all of coming off and we still have some assets on balance sheet, some assets off balance sheet.","But the really the opportunity here is to be able to scale it as Bruce has said, be able to scale that business and be able to grow it more quickly. So that we don't have additional losses going forward, the ideas to remove those losses. So hopefully that answers your question.","Amy Smith","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","George Hill","Good morning, guys. And I appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe switching gears for a second, talk a little bit about pharmacy. You've seen some of your competitors kind of pursue some interesting partnership strategies and you guys have had the decline in Med D enrollment. I guess, do you feel like you need to partner up with somebody either on the rebate aggregation side or the pharmacy network side to get better economic side of your pharmacy business? And do you feel like the current partnerships that you have right now are delivering the rates that you need in that book?","Bruce Broussard","I would first say we are always looking for ways to bring lower costs to our members. So whether it's an \u2013 and we do have some generic partnerships today that we buy with and through. So I would say that the recent announcement that you're referring to is to something that others do, but I wouldn't say we are not exempt from that, but we just don't broadcast it.","But we do orient to how do we have a cost of goods and we constantly are checking that. And what we find is that we are very, very competitive in the marketplace. The Part D decline is not so much of a cost to goods. Conversation is more around just the pricing of the product itself.","And as Brian articulated with the unique aspect of Part D is you can't start a plan without removing a plan and it gets complicated to do that and that's what you see happening. So I would say is more on the plan design side for Part D and it is on the side of the cost of goods.","And related to the pharmacy, we're constantly looking for ways to expand our capabilities, whether that's from a delivery point of view to care and clinical point of view, like in specialty pharmacy and in addition in areas that are more oriented to rebates.","I would just say that we are content today, but I wouldn't say that content is something that we are going to continue. We will continue as we did with Enclara and other things that we've done this past year to like to advance that. But again, I think the emphasis to the question is I would not connect the Part D declined to capabilities within our pharmacy as a whole.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. I wanted to go back to the commercial conversation. I don't remember if you actually gave it, but what was commercial trend in 2019? I understand the concept of risk converting into ASO, but you raised your MLR guidance multiple times through the year and then the fact that you experienced negative development almost every quarter through the year implies that in trend is rising.","And just trying to understand why that's not the case. And I heard your comments about why you feel better about next year, but given that consistent MLR guidance increase and given the consistent negative development, how much confidence I guess you really have in your visibility into that book right now?","Brian Kane","Good morning, Kevin. So again, I would distinguish between core trend and sort of the net trend that we're seeing as on account of sort of the morbidity mix in our book. Our core trends are relatively stable. I would say just like last year, 6% plus or minus the 50 is \u2013 50 basis points is sort of a reasonable place to be.","We ended up in that range for 2019. It's really the net trend, once it sort of filters through in the membership that we have and our morbidity mix that says driving that. Obviously our commercial book is small. And as a consequence, it's hard to extrapolate broader for those with larger books or whatever it may be, it's just ours is very focused.","It's almost entirely small group based. Well north of 50% of our premium comes from lives under a 100 or groups under a 100. And so we're in this interesting part of the marketplace that I think has just been going through a lot of change with respect to the ACA community rated block, the 2 to 50 block, the migration to LFP, grandmother, grandfather products.","It's just \u2013 there's just been a lot of churn in that market. And so that's really been where we've been focused. As Bruce said, we want to move up market a little bit into the more mid group, larger group space to be more relevant in certain key markets.","And we're it is a strategic objective of ours to do that. I would say we're always mindful of trend and where it's going, but we're less focused on the core trend side than we are in the business mix that we're attracting, so hopefully that that distinction makes sense.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Joshua Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. When I just get back to the Primary Care conversation and maybe just take a step back. You've got a whole bunch of different assets and strategies around this broad strategy of physician enablement.","And I guess I want to understand, what's the ultimate goal? Is this about growing your market share in Medicare Advantage? Is this about improving the core profitability of your MA book or is this about controlling medical cost spend and sort of creating a new sort of business segment, business line that over time can kind of augment the overall Humana. I'm just curious about sort of, where this all starts in terms of and what the end game is?","Brian Kane","Let me try to take that and put it in a few elements, that it originates out of we feel that this is a very effective care model. And I think as Peter asked a while back, we've been doing this for some time and we have a lot of proven results from this. And when you look at our members in these programs, as all the results there, the one thing I didn't mention is also retention is higher.","And so we see wonderful performance out of there. And if we could wave a magic one, we would want 100% of our members in these programs for all the reasons we've talked about. The challenge we find in today's world is that the fee-for-service payment model and the model \u2013 the operating model within that is sort of what dominates the healthcare system.","And our ability to put seniors in these type of clinics is very \u2013 there isn't a lot of supply. I mean, as you well know, DaVita was probably the one and only that had more scale there. And so over the last few years, we've tried to find a way to scale it, with, through joint ventures and alliances is what Brian was talking about.","And in addition to have our PR proprietary product, because what we want to make sure of is over time we have a product that when we're in a market that we have a stability in our network and that we're able to fulfill that and these particular products allow us to both if we have ownership and other contractual rights has allows us to control our destiny markets that we want to ensure our members have the proper providers too.","And so the first is great performance. Second is the ability to have in the market protection around the, we call it the supply chain. And then the third is, is once you begin to go those two routes, then there's the question, how do you optimize that the performance of that business. And what you see us doing is saying, it needs to be agnostic.","It needs to be a business upon itself. It needs to be able to grow and serve the community there, which benefits us as both as an owner of the product, but also it benefits our plan because our plan is also being able to have a lower cost serving there and more effective.","And so then it turns into how do we maximize the business on itself, but it's originates from what's best for our member. Then goes to how do we control and ensure that we have stability in the marketplace for supply chain. And then the third thing it moves to is now to how do we maximize the business there.","Where it ultimately ends up, as I think you're going to see it, as Brian said, we want to double our membership in this particular area over the next few years. And you're seeing Welsh, Carson is one of them along with our affiliates are another way to do that.","But over time, I think the investors will see that this will be another part of our business, no different than when we started pharmacy years ago. And it became part of that. And no different than what you'll see with the home that it will be a business that will be profitable. It will be valuable from a shareholder point of view, but it also will be valuable for our members' point of view.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Hi. Good morning. My question focuses on the partnership with Microsoft and Epic. What are kind of like the timelines on deploying Epic in a patient EMR? It really captures the data, the member data across the Humana enterprise. And then as we think about this longer term, does this really become sort of a prerequisite for clinic partnerships outside kind of fact the Humana homegrown base?","Bruce Broussard","Yes, I'll take that. Interoperability is that a core, what we see enables value-based payment models and the ability for us to manage complex patients just because of the complexity of the system and the complexity of people's conditions. So to answer your first question, and just where are we in that journey. Microsoft and Epic are really two different journeys, but both are well along the way. And the Microsoft approach, we really have three different horizons.","One is a cloud and moving everything to cloud and allowing a much more agile environment. And at the same time building a longitudinal health record that allows to use fire and interoperability inside the organization and outside the organization. And both of those things are well on their way. We have \u2013 I think we announced last quarter some partners that we've already rolled out part of the longitudinal record. And so that is now in structurally there. We just have to continue to add our partners to it.","This year, we'll be bringing on all of Kindred in that relationship as a result of them completing their EMR install. There's a number of providers through the compass product that we have that are using the longitudinal record along with some of our pharmacy areas, including Enclara that we just acquired. So we have a really good progress going on in both the cloud conversion. I think cloud conversion is going to take about five years, but what you see and most of that is the traditional technology that's been around for a long period of time taking the longest.","On the Epic side, what you see is, we are in \u2013 we just really \u2013 we have a number of hospitals today that we are now passing information back and forth through in the Epic conversion. I mean the Epic connection that is in use case only. We're not really announcing what those use cases are, but we are in market with a number of hospitals. These are integrated systems that we are passing information back and forth with the Epic area.","These are the beginning of a long process. No different than what we are talking with the clinics about the ability to have interoperability, which leads me to the third. It is a standard we will employ with our clinics of having interoperability. Most of our clinics today already have that interoperability where you'll just see us continue to do it more.","But more importantly through any kind of deep partnership, we are looking for interoperability to be a part of that partnership. No different than the value-based payment models and other mechanisms that we use. But interoperability will be an important part of that.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the HIF repeal in 2021, obviously sort of all in worth over $9 to EPS before any offsets and kind of a uniform magnitude impact to MAOs across the industry, which tends to be concentrated at the local level. So I guess is there any reason to think that MA plans won't act rationally to use a portion of the pretax tailwind to absorb any headwind, the rule change on ESRD patients creates?","And relatedly, if you could maybe comment on any advocacy efforts with CMS on this front, whether the agency has been receptive and gets the issue and your expectations for what we'll see there, whether they'll provide actuarially sound rates for ESRD patients in 2021, on the advanced notice it's tomorrow. Kind of curious if this risk factor could actually turn into an earnings opportunity.","Brian Kane","Hi. Good morning, Steve. So I think it's fair to say, obviously the HIF \u2013 tailwind would certainly help offset any ESRD headwind. And I think what we're trying to just understand is the magnitude of that headwind. And over the coming months where you're doing lots of modeling in various scenarios that would drive different levels of penetration in ESRD, which will obviously impact the 2021 earnings profile.","It wouldn't be crazy to think that ESRD penetration could get to Medicare Advantage levels. We'll see. We're modeling that. There's been a bunch of commentary on the Street about that by various analysts. And so we are working through that.","I think it's important to really break the population into two buckets: one, being duals, one being non-duals to really understand the impact. On the dual side, MA could have some appeal to them just because of the supplementary benefits, particularly around transportation and some over the counter benefits. And so that's one of the things we're looking at.","And on the non-dual side, particularly under 65 ESRD population, you really need to look at where Med Sup is and understand what the Med Sup availability is for these various folks. And in some states it's not available or it's not required to be available or there are significant premiums.","And so it's certainly a premium for someone to buy it. And so that's what we're really trying to understand what the impact will be. Again, we feel good about where we are for 2021. Obviously, the health insurance fee is a big positive.","And on the advocacy side, clearly rates is one factor, and we'll see where CMS comes out. I think it's just important for people to understand why the benchmark maybe understated. And that's a function of the fact that there is not a maximum amount of pocket in fee-for-service while there is an MA and so that impacts the cost.","And also, typically, people \u2013 HMOs pay higher rates than original Medicare to the large dialysis providers and so that also impacts the cost. So obviously rate is one element, making sure that there's a competition in the marketplace is another in terms of the provision of dialysis care. And so we're working with CMS on that both in terms of some of the CON state, CON requirements around what people can build in terms of getting the CON laws getting through those as well as basic conditions for coverage.","And what sort of innovative capabilities can we bring to bear in the ESRD space, whether it's around the home, whether it's around micro clinics, various alternative sites of care to provide dialysis. But regardless, we're working very hard on it. We're standing up clinical teams to be able to take these members. And over the long-term, we understand why it makes sense to bring ESRD into this population. We just need to manage the short-term transition.","So a long winded answer to your question. We're taking it from multiple angles, modeling it appropriately, doing appropriate advocacy and then preparing the clinical side and working with our dialysis partners to come up with creative risk sharing mechanisms to help drive outcomes. Hopefully that's helpful.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the individual MA membership, you added almost 230,000 members during AEP. When I look at last year, you added almost 10% of total enrollment in OEP and then you saw further growth in sort of the aging in D-SNP.","So I guess when I look at that 270 to 330 range, seems like you're trending closer to the higher end, if not even above that. Is that fair or help us with other considerations sort of this year versus last year that may not make that be the case? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Well, obviously we hope you're right, but there's a lot of game left to play. I would say that we feel good about the 270 to 330 that we put out there. We finished AEP at around 229,000 for the January lives. And I think this year is different than last year in that. On a relative basis, we're not as strong from a benefit design as we were on a relative basis in 2019.","And so we have to see what are the sales are going to be and what are the terms going to be. Obviously, the sales opportunities are a little bit less in the post AEP then the pre and during AEP. And you saw the terminations in your book and we have a larger book. And so if you have a similar term rate, you actually lose more lives, right.","And so those are the types of things we're working. We're working through. We're closely monitoring OEP and it seems to be going well. We'll see where it ultimately shakes out. But I would just say we feel good about the 270 to 330 that we put out.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. I wanted to go back to the healthcare side of the business. I think you said \u2013 I wanted to confirm, you said you had completed the Homecare Homebase conversion. So I'm assuming that means the drag from that conversion should be completed. And then what are sort of your early reads on PDG on the home healthcare side? Are you seeing your rates higher or lower or flat?","And then finally just what kind of financial drag would you be removing from your income statement balance sheet with moving those assets into this partnership in primary care? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Okay. So on Homecare Homebase, it is completed. It was a herculean effort. I think the team did it faster than any conversion that's happened before. Just the magnitude of an EMR conversion on both the home and hospice side is very significant.","The team did an extraordinary job. And so we're very excited about that. And so that drag is no longer there for 2020, although it was meaningful for 2019. And that's part of the increase in EBITDA that you're seeing in the Healthcare Services side.","I think it's still too early to comment on PDGM. I think things are going as we planned and as expected. They're adjusting to the change in the payment model. The impacts of that are reflected in our 2020 numbers. But I think the team feels good about mitigating the EBITDA impact of that.","The important side for us in particular is the clinical side and we're excited about the movement of the model to much more as I said earlier, to much more of a chronic nursing model, and so that's positive. But it does change the operating model, when you have a payment model like this that is focused on these chronic conditions. And so they're working through that. And I think doing a very nice job.","We haven't called out the specific financial drag on the clinics. Broadly, depending on the size of the clinic to get the profitability, you're talking sort of high-single digits million EBITDA to get to profitability over a several year period, including the CapEx. So you can multiply through and see some of the impact.","I mean, ultimately the size of the facility, the $600 million facility is effectively over a period of P&L burn that we're taking off our income statement. The purpose of the facility is to fund those losses.","And so I think that gives you the order of magnitude over the life cycle of the investment, what the impact is. And typically by year four, year five, these things are really starting to breakeven and drive profitability. So I think that gives you a broad sense of the impact which is why it's so important that we did this, so we could scale the opportunity.","Bruce Broussard","Yes, Frank and I know your question wasn't inferring this, but I'd just like to emphasize it. The main reason why we're doing this with WCAS is to scale the business. And that's probably what Brian was articulating because we feel it's a great addition to the organization and the organization is ready to scale it. Some of the things that Brian was talking about were some barriers to do it. But at the end of the day, we want to scale this and begin to start getting more and more members in our proprietary product.","Brian Kane","I would just add one more point. We get this question all the time. I want to make sure investors have this. In terms of where the EBITDA per clinic can go because we get asked that all the time, and it really can vary. So some of the smaller clinics could be, $2 million, $3 million, $4 million. Some of the bigger clinics could be $6 million, $7 million, $8 million. So it really depends on the size of the clinic in terms of EBITDA. But when you look at the economics, just the return on capital on individual clinic, when these get to profitability, it's a really good model.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, Bruce and Brian. So two questions around the first quarter of 2020, first for the Group and Specialty segment, you're targeting 84% to 84.5% benefit ratio for the full-year. But given that the jump off point in 4Q in 2019 is in the 95% range, I guess I'm curious, will that gradually trend back down throughout 2020 or will your improvement show up immediately, such that 1Q 2020 for the segment maybe in line with the full-year range, somewhere in that mid 80% range? That's question one.","And then question two, also around 1Q. I mean the stock's up 20 bucks right now, so I need to focus on the slight negative. But I mean the adjusted tax rate in 4Q 2019, I think came somewhere in the mid single-digits, probably due to the Group and Specialty segment results. But just given your comment around 1Q 2020 earnings being 24% of the full-year or should we assume the overall tax rate normalizes back to, call it, 30% or so in 1Q 2020? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Fair questions. We don't give quarterly MER guidance by segment as you know, but I think it's fair to say, the Group, the way the Group segment works is the MER is low in the first part of the year and then it increases as people get through their deductible.","So, I think in terms of the way you think about the sort of quarterly progression of MERs, you can look at historical patterns and see what it is for the Group business and just use our annual number and frac it out accordingly. But just the way the benefit design works, it's lower MER at the beginning and then it ramps up through the year as people go through their deductibles and we start covering the cost.","On the tax rate side, really two drivers. One is what's \u2013 I guess there was the windfall tax, which is \u2013 we have stock vestings in December. When our stock annually vest and we had a big run up in our stock and so the tax deduction is larger and that drives the improved tax rate.","As you know, the stock moved a lot in the last few months and it's been volatile. But when it occurred, when the vesting occurred, we had the windfall benefit, we also saw profitability show up in different States, somewhere lower tax States than we expected, so small moves in that can impact the tax rate a bit. And so that was also driving it. So it was really for those two reasons that we had a lower tax rate.","Bruce Broussard","But in general, when you look at the tax rate on an annual basis, it remained relatively the same. I mean, there's a 50 basis points change, so when you're looking at an annual side, it had minimum impact on it.","Amy Smith","All right, thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Most of my questions answered. I'll just be real quick. When we go to the Healthcare Services EBITDA growth, I think 17% at the midpoint. I know you've covered some of the one-time investments you're lapping, et cetera. Is it possible to help us think about organic versus acquisition? Is it contemplated that any of the trailing acquisitions or any forward acquisitions are in that number or is that a pretty pure organic growth for 2020?","Bruce Broussard","Yes. Good morning, Gary. There are some acquisitions in there from the Enclara deal, though it's \u2013 I would say it's in relatively small. That would be acquisition. I do think there are some, as you said, lapping investments on Homecare Homebase, which helps, I would say most is organic improvement. But if you're sort of trying to model beyond 2020, I wouldn't expect that kind of EBITDA growth beyond 2020.","I think it will more normalize to a lower level. So I think that's a fair question there. There are some good guys in there. But the business organically is growing very nicely. I mean really all elements, pharmacy, home and primary care are growing nicely organically. So I would take the balanced EBITDA growth, but there are some good guys in there for 2020.","Gary Taylor","Great. Okay, thanks.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Just a quick one on D-SNP. The performance has been pretty impressive. Brian, maybe just any color around benefits design plan strategy, anything that's contributed to the recent performance and any expectations for the rest of the year. Is this a one-time boost through open enrollment or do you see the momentum continuing throughout the year? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Sure. Hey, good morning Whit. So we're certainly hopeful that the D-SNP growth continues. We'll see where it goes. We are proud of the D-SNP growth that we've achieved. I think on the benefits side, we continue to emphasize some of the over-the-counter benefits and a few other things.","I wouldn't say there was anything dramatically different this year. I think it's really a focus of the organization. Leveraging some of our distribution channels to make sure we are appealing to the D-SNP population. It's also frankly offering D-SNPs in more counties as well, and so expanding that as well. And so it's really a combination of things. But yes, I would just tell you that it's certainly an organizational focus of ours in driving the distribution and sales of that product.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is open.","Scott Fidel","Hi, good morning. Just wanting to toggle back over to Group and Specialty, and definitely sounds like you're still committed to the business in terms of the investments that you're making and hoping for brighter days ahead, when we look at the 2020 guidance, it still is implying pretax margins still sub 2% and topline growth sub 2% as well. So if we think that some of these bets that you're making around in the investments do ultimately payoff, what type of growth rates do you think and pretax margins are reasonable to think about being sustainable in the longer term?","Bruce Broussard","Yes. It's a fair question, Scott. I really not prepared today to give details on margin and growth. I do think the margins are clearly not nearly where they need to be. We haven't given a margin target on Group, and I'm not prepared to do that today. But I would tell you that we do expect margins to improve.","The ASO level funded margins are much better and will continue to get better as we mature in that product. And hopefully as we move up market, we'll also see some margin improvement as we leveraged some of the unit cost benefits we can get by being a bigger presence in the marketplace. And again, we hope we can get you to grow the level funded product, but also grow up market as well in terms of the topline.","And so the goal would be to start growing that topline in addition to getting the PMPM benefits that you get in the group space. So we do think there's an opportunity there, but I wouldn't expect significant growth. We're hopeful that we can really turn it around and start getting measured growth as we move forward here in both frankly, top end and bottom line.","And also importantly just the cross-sell benefit that I mentioned on the specialty side and on the Medicare side, that's an important part of this as well. That won't show up directly in the segment results.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore. Your line is open.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Maybe just going back to HIF repeal and I appreciate you're not committing to anything in 2021. But I just wanted to confirm that long-term, since you're still targeting that 4.5% to 5% pretax margin. So that's ultimately a higher net margin once HIF is gone. So is that just fair to say that the nondeductible headwind will still drop back to margins eventually, but maybe just not all immediately if you favor enrollment growth more instead for a period of time? Is that the right way to frame it?","Bruce Broussard","I think that's fair. We're committed 4.5% to 5%. Similarly on the tax reform, we did the same thing. We went below and then it came back up and so yes, we're committed to 4.5% to 5%.","Amy Smith","Great. Thank you. I think that was our last question.","Bruce Broussard","Okay, well I'll just close it out. Again, thanks for our investors and especially today considering it lasted for an hour and a half. So we have a lot of engaged investors, so we appreciate that. And as importantly thanks to the 50,000 people that get up every day and help our members achieve their best health there. So everyone have a great week, and we will talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating.

Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Finally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in this morning's call refer to diluted earnings per common share. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike McCallister.","Michael B. McCallister","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Humana announced first quarter earnings of $1.49 per share, above the top end of our previous guidance. In light of these results, we are increasing our guidance for full year earnings per share to a range of $7.55 to $7.75 from our previous range of $7.50 to $7.70. Our better-than-expected results reflect Humana's continued focus on the growth that comes from helping people achieve lifelong well-being, particularly in Medicare. ","In today's call, I'll discuss 3 major Medicare growth opportunities for Humana. Medicare age-ins as baby boomers retire, Group Medicare business and longer-term Medicare\/Medicaid dual-eligibles. To put these opportunities in context, let me begin with a brief review of Humana's strategy. ","For several years, I've been emphasizing the importance of membership growth in Medicare Advantage and PDP as the primary key to Humana's long-term prosperity. We've consequently developed a growth cycle repeated each 12 months, which has achieved notable success. ","It works like this. First, we reset our Medicare margins to 5% in the bids we file with CMS each June. Next, we vigorously pursue the comprehensive data-driven medical management and operating cost initiatives that make up our 15 Percent Solution. The progress we make each year is reinvested into attractive highly competitive products for the following year, what you often hear me describe as our senior value proposition. ","Finally, in addition to Medicare membership growth, our increasing scale produces related benefits for business adjacencies like RightSource and Concentra as we acquaint all of our members with a wide array of Humana products and services with the goal of maximizing lifetime customer value. Our first quarter results extended this successful cycle and positioned us well for additional growth.","This slide shows just how significant that growth has been over the last 3 years. We achieved a net new Medicare Advantage membership increase of 254,000 in 2010; 196,000 in 2011; and are projecting 330,000 to 340,000 net new numbers by the end of this year, the biggest single year increase since 2006. Our stand-alone PDP net new growth estimate for this year is 500,000 to 600,000 on top of the 859,000 net new members we added in 2011. ","With respect to newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries, the first of the 3 opportunities, I've discussed in previous calls how our one-to-one retail approach to Medicare Advantage sales, combined with our compelling senior value proposition, positions us well as the age-in population increases. ","This slide shows that in the growing Medicare Advantage market, Humana's growth is outpacing the sector's overall growth. Working in tandem, these 2 trends are adding appreciably to our scale, which is especially important in the post-reform environment. ","I'll now turn to Group Medicare Advantage, the second of our 3 Medicare growth opportunities. This market has been estimated at approximately 14 million eligibles. It clearly has significant potential, but requires patience since the sales cycle tends to be long. We're seeing an uptick in interest recently as commercial and public sector employers, faced with the baby boomer retirement wave, are engaging in serious discussions with us more actively than ever before. ","We're also seeing promising early results. Since 2008, Humana has added more than 300,000 Group Medicare Advantage members. We expect to continue to be an active participant here as employers seek national players with depth and breadth of experience managing retiree health benefit costs. ","Turning thirdly to dual-eligibles. This slide sizes the market opportunity for full duals at nearly 7 million eligibles. We believe firmly that our knowledge of the senior population, together with our proven clinical care model serving those living with multiple chronic conditions, gives Humana a distinct advantage in addressing the high cost and poor health often associated with the dual-eligibles. Bruce Broussard will speak more fully to this opportunity in his remarks. ","As I do each quarter, let me now briefly update you on our 15 Percent Solution. Having just completed the first full quarter since our Anvita Health acquisition, I'll highlight how our Anvita rules engine has been integrated with our Care Hub medical management system to refine and enhance clinical care management, bringing real time big data to our members' benefit. ","Anvita's powerful rules engine collects and standardizes to disparate data sources using proprietary algorithms it then identifies and prioritizes specific areas for intervention, predicts where clinical outreach is likely to be required, and together with our Atlas Rules engine, determines how best to reach out to our members to ensure maximum productivity. ","Let's quickly walk through how this works. We have a multitude of data elements about each of our members. The Anvita Rules engine processed 64 billion pieces of data for our medical membership in December 2011 alone. That translates into approximately 200 billion data elements being analyzed per quarter. Once such data is processed, Anvita then interacts with Atlas to determine the greatest opportunities to address gaps in care for our members. ","In December 2011, approximately 354,000 actionable gaps in care were identified, then in turn, generated a multitude of alerts to nurses, providers, members and our service operations teams. As a result, 31% of these gaps in care were converted into actions to improve outcomes for those members. ","We continue to study all of this data to identify additional ways to improve our outreach. Needless to say, we're excited about the positive behavior change implications for our members this new tool provides. The effectiveness of our chronic care management system is being further augmented by our pending SeniorBridge acquisition. We begun to work with the SeniorBridge team, including 5 -- 1,500 geriatric care managers throughout the U.S., we're visiting the homes of seniors living with multiple chronic conditions. ","All of our work in chronic care management is designed to ultimately help our member stay out of institutionalized care, and instead, age with grace in their home. We want seniors to have the best quality of life possible. That includes the best possible health status that, in turn, can contribute to independence, a better consumer experience and lower costs. ","To that end, we also strive to ensure our senior value proposition remains robust regardless of the rate environment. With 2013 rates from CMS now finalized, we are deeply involved in the 2013 bid design process. We anticipate that similar to years past, we will design competitive benefit packages that continue to offer compelling value across the country. ","To conclude, we are pleased that 2012 is off to a solid start and look forward to sharing more of our progress with you on future earnings calls. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce for detailed remarks about our dual-eligible strategy, as well as some recent organizational developments.","Bruce D. Broussard","Thank you, Mike. I'd like to touch on a few things just before Jim Bloem take us through the financials for the quarter in detail. As I've met with investors over the past quarter, interest in how Humana will pursue the dual-eligible opportunity has been strong. Therefore, I'll spend a few moments on our approach to the duals market and our recently announced agreement with CareSource. ","Let me begin with the basic tenets of our dual-eligible strategy. First, we will actively participate in this market. We believe the benefits are twofold: revenues per member can be quite high; and we see an incredible opportunity to help this population achieve lifelong well-being.","To that end, we must effectively leverage our knowledge of the senior population and the related chronic care management expertise we've gained during our 25 years in the Medicare program. We must also recognize where we need assistance with such specialized areas as the tenant population and long-term care. In such cases, we intend to work with the industry leaders in these areas to ensure that the implementation of the program is seamless to the member while producing high-quality care.","Finally, we must participate in a deliberate fashion. The market still is in flux, particularly with respect to the state and federal technical guidance. Having said that, we believe we are fully ready to participate in this dynamic market. ","To address the opportunity with more precision, this slide illustrates the per member per month cost associated with the various components of the Medicaid market. Not surprisingly PMPMs weighted heavily towards duals and long-term care members with our care management and clinical intervention programs can be most effective. ","There have been many questions at how our duals strategy is aligned with the timing of the CMS demonstration project with the states. States can pursue the program in 3 different structures: One option is to combine the tenants and senior-aged duals in one program. Second option is to separate the tenant from the seniors but require both medical and long-term care management. And the third is not to participate in the CMS demonstration project, leaving duals under the existing state programs. ","This slide outlines the number of full dual members in our existing business, and more importantly, the membership opportunity for states prioritizing our strategic plan. Note that the number of members at risk is relatively small, 52,000, in comparison to the 4.5 million membership opportunity. We believe the limited number of states requiring services with TANF is very manageable with our recently announced CareSource alliance. ","In addition, we have a significant opportunity in states requiring long-term care with our Humana Cares and our pending SeniorBridge acquisition capabilities, combined with leveraging our long-term care service partners. Obviously, it is too early to quantify our expected success. However, our cautious strategy of partnering through alliances provides the opportunity to participate in the early stages of the demonstration project, but provides flexibility as the state technical guidance is more defined. ","We are very excited about our alliance with CareSource that we announced in the first quarter and believe it will position us for the dual success in a number of geographies. With Humana being one of the most respected Medicare companies in the U.S., we now have a proven Medicaid partner with 23 years of experience and a solid reputation with government agencies. ","Through this alliance, Humana and CareSource will deliver innovative solutions to enhance care coordination and improve health outcomes. CareSource will take the lead in servicing the TANF members in those states where the bidding requirements to serve duals is combined with the TANF population. ","Let me close by highlighting some recent organizational changes as we continue to thoughtfully adjust our organizational structure to be more aligned with our customer-centric operating segments. We are pleased to make 2 key appointments in the first quarter. First, Tom Liston was promoted to President of our Retail Segment. Tom has been instrumental in leading our Senior Products Group for the past several years. He was the ideal choice to oversee the entire Retail Segment.","Second, Tim McClain was promoted to President of our Government and Other Businesses. With a solid background in government and military services, including several years with Humana Military as the Head of our Veteran Services, Tim will be highly effective in ensuring that our multifaceted military and veteran service business will continue to thrive.","These leaders are but 2 examples of a highly capable individuals whom I have known -- have the pleasure of working on a day-to-day basis. I continue to be impressed by the intelligence, dedication and deep concern that I see for our members from leaders and associates throughout the company. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim now.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. Looking at the first quarter, we were pleased with earnings per share of $1.49, which exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance of $1.40 by $0.09. ","As indicated on the slide, there were 2 principal items that drove this over performance: first, greater-than-anticipated prior period development of medical claims reserves added $0.03 per share to the quarter's results. This amount was lower than the $0.31 of favorable development experienced during last year's first quarter, a difference that I will discuss when I review each segment's results in the next few minutes.","Second, we lowered our estimate of the 2011 Medical Loss Ratio rebates payable for our Employer Group and individual commercial business lines by approximately $15 million, which added $0.06 per share to the results for the first quarter. $13 million of this $15 million was driven by our Commercial Group business while the remaining $2 million was attributable to our individual commercial business. Looking ahead to the full year, these same 2 principles apply as indicated on the slide.","In addition, we now have included the recent Arcadian acquisition in our full year 2012 guidance. We estimate that Arcadian will be $0.05 per share dilutive due to transaction and integration costs. Arcadian is expected to become accretive once we switch the business to our platform on January 1, 2013. So in summary, we now expect full year 2012 earnings per share of $7.55 to $7.75, an increase of $0.05 per share over our previous guidance midpoint.","In this morning's press release, we also included EPS guidance of $2.15 to $2.25 for the second quarter. Based upon our 2012 full year guidance of $7.55 to $7.75 per share, we expect to earn slightly more than 1\/2 of our full year EPS in the second half of the year. ","In contrast, we earned 54% of our 2011 EPS in the first half of the year. This 2012 difference in our earnings pattern of the first half versus the second half of the year primarily is attributable to the following 3 factors: first, our 2002 year-over-year -- our 2012 year-over-year quarterly administrative expense growth for the rest of this year is expected to be progressively lower versus 2011. As in prior years, we expect to incur a higher run rate of marketing and enrollment costs for our Medicare business during the final 4 months of 2012. However, in 2011, we also were investing increasing amounts in our clinical and provider infrastructure throughout the year. Accordingly, the 2012 year-over-year quarterly change in this investment spend is expected to decrease as we progress through this year. Thus, even though our Retail Segment operating expense ratio was 40 basis points higher in the first quarter of 2012 than it was in the first quarter of '11, we expect that, ultimately, it will come in around 50 basis points lower for the full year 2012 versus 2011.","Second, the expected growth rate in our PDP membership by 550,000 members at the midpoint results in a further shift of our earnings toward the second half of the year. As we've discussed on numerous occasions, the annual benefit change of the PDP product results in a declining medical expense ratio as the year progresses. And finally, leap day this year had the impact of moving more expense into the first half of the year relative to the second half. Accordingly, after including the impact of these 3 items, we remain comfortable with our second half 2012 forecasts.","Turning now in more detail to the first quarter Retail Segment results. Pretax earnings of $115 million were in line with our expectations. They included the $33 million impact of favorable prior period development versus $40 million in last year's first quarter. It is also important to note that leap day resulted in an extra $40 million of medical expense compared to last year's first quarter. ","Looking at the full year. As I mentioned previously, we now have included the impact of the Arcadian acquisition in our forecast, which results in approximately $0.05 per share dilution, a $14 million pretax loss. Again, the 2012 Arcadian dilution reflects both transaction costs, as well as the full cost of the integration to prepare this business to fully transition to our Medicare platform on January 1, 2013. ","Thus, in evaluating our full year 2012 Retail Segment pretax margin guidance range of 5.2% to 5.4%, it should be noted that the inclusion of Arcadian reduced our anticipated pretax margin by 20 basis points. However, on a same-store basis with our previous Retail margin guidance range of 5.3% to 5.5%, the revised pretax margin outlook for our Retail book of business, excluding Arcadian, actually is anticipated to increase by 10 basis points to a range of 5.4% to 5.6%, again primarily due to the favorable prior period development I discussed earlier.","Finally, as you review the Retail Segment for the full year, please remember the 3 things that I mentioned earlier: first, the operating expense ratio will improve relative to last year as we go through this year; second, the addition of 550,000 at the midpoint PDP members, which, as usual, primarily benefits the second half pretax income; and third, also as usual, we do not include any future benefit from any additional prior period development in our full year forecast.","Turning now to the Employer Group segment. Our pretax income of $121 million included 2 items that were not considered in our previous forecast as indicated on the slide. First, the results included the impact of $30 million in unfavorable prior period development, which I will elaborate on in just a minute. Second, we lowered our estimate of the 2011 minimum Medical Loss Ratio rebate payable by $13 million during the first quarter, which benefited our first quarter results. This amount was primarily attributable to the refinement of state-level calculations based on the first quarter runout of claims.","With respect to the unfavorable prior period development, the $30 million consist primarily of the following 2 nontrend-related events: first, the timing of claims processing changes primarily at some of our claims clearinghouses as a result of their implementation of the HIPAA 5010 requirements caused us to slightly underestimate our IBNR at the end of the year. We are confident that this was a disruption around year end that is fully behind us since we are now processing over 98% of all claims in the new 5010 format. This change accounted for more than 1\/2 of the $30 million. ","Second, a onetime plan design change for one medium-sized Group Medicare Advantage account resulted in a slight underestimation of the related fourth quarter claims for this group and this accounted for most of the remainder of the $30 million. ","So to summarize with the respect to medical claims reserve development, we had $8 million or $0.03 per share in the aggregate of greater-than-anticipated favorable development. And we anticipate there should be additional favorable development throughout the remaining 3 quarters of the year just as there has been in prior years since we continue to use the same actuarially based consistent reserving methodology from period-to-period as in the prior years.","With respect to 2012 commercial medical cost trends, although we continue to expect a gradual uptick in utilization at some point, we did not experience an increase in the first quarter. In fact, we saw lower levels of inpatient hospitalization than we had expected. Although we have not changed our trend outlook for the full year, our trend forecast has now moved toward the lower end of the range of 6% to 6.5% that we have been planning for the full year and have discussed during the last 2 earnings conference calls.","And finally, as also shown on the slide, leap-day negatively impacted the first quarter of this year by $15 million compared to 2011. Thus, with respect to the Employer Group segment, we're pleased with our overall pretax income of $121 million for the first quarter after giving consideration to the nontrend-related unfavorable development and the other factors listed on the slide. We remain confident of our full year Employer Group pretax outlook.","Turning next to our Health and Well-Being Services Segment. As shown on this slide, both pretax and revenue earnings are showing significant growth over 2011. This is primarily due to the increase in volumes for our PBM and mail order operations, which are a result of increased Medicare Advantage and Medicare PDP membership, as well as increasing same-store mail order penetration levels. Also in this morning's press release, we've added statistical Page 9, which shows pharmacy metrics that provide further detail regarding our generic dispense rates and our script volumes.","This final slide updates our current financial resources and 2012 capital deployment plans. But first, I want to comment on the first quarter 2012 cash flows, which were affected by an early CMS payment of 2 point -- $2,020,000,000 on March 30 related to the premiums for the month of April. ","Excluding the early payment from CMS, first quarter operating cash flows were $465 million lower than in the first quarter of '11 due both to lower net income and working capital timing differences. The approximately $400 million of working capital timing differences primarily were due to roughly equal changes in both benefits payable and other liabilities. ","The majority of the benefits payable portion included the timing of payments to our pharmacy benefit administrator while the other liabilities primarily included lower Part D risk share accruals and an additional associate payroll cycle. Accordingly, we remain confident in our full year 2012 operating cash flows guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion. ","From the standpoint of available financial resources, we are pleased to report that after consultations with the various state departments of insurance and the credit rating agencies, we expect to receive $1,022,000,000 in 2012 dividends from our operating subsidiaries during the next 90 days. This amount compares with $1,077,000,000 of 2011 dividends and will increase the March 31, 2012, parent cash and investments balance of $225 million. ","With respect to our 2012 capital deployment plans, we continue our consistent and constant review of strategically important potential acquisitions and investments, as well as capital projects while concurrently returning capital to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividends and a strong repurchase program.","As noted in the press release, the board recently increased our quarterly cash dividend initiated last year to $0.26 per share. At the same time, the board also refreshed our share repurchase program to up to $1 billion through June 30, 2014. Like the previous authorization, the new authorization permits shares to be repurchased from time-to-time at prices in the open market by block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions. ","And with that, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, will you please introduce the first caller?","Regina Nethery","We're ready for questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could I just ask on the -- your comments on medical cost trend where you actually saw utilization a bit lower. I assume that's adjusted for the leap-day impact. Are you seeing that in both commercial, and Medicare and any more granularity you can give us on that?","James H. Bloem","Well, the remarks that I gave were really confined to the commercial because that's the one that tends to vary more and it was -- and I discussed it under Employer Group. But in the Medicare, again we've not seen a lot of change. So again, we're very comfortable with sort of what we've been seeing. The leap day was accounted for in our pricing and in how we take into account our medical expense recognition.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And let me ask back on the commercial side. What are you guys seeing now in terms of price competition across your local markets? Would you say that -- have you seen any change, would you say, compared to a year or 2 ago?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. The -- breaking it into the various case sizes, the Small Group block of business seems nicely positioned throughout the markets. Periodically, you'll see a market get a little bit hot. But generally speaking, we think we're nicely positioned for 2012. We had a nice growth here in 2011 with Small Group. On the Large Group side, the case size that continues to always be highly competitive is what we refer to, in past, as the portfolio size cases or 100 to 300 employees per group and that seems to be very, very competitive in all the marketplaces that we do business. Nothing real crazy in terms of the self-funded competitive landscape. Every now and again, you see a quote for a particular case that you scratch your head about, but nothing systematic. So well positioned in the smaller case sizes. The portfolio's a little bit aggressive in various other markets that we do business. But as you can see from some of the guidance points that we gave, the fully insured growth potential that we see for 2012 is positive for us, and we're just blocking and tackling.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I would take it then that the growth is more in the individual Small Group side and less on, I guess, what we refer to as middle market?","James E. Murray","That's a fair point, yes.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just the first question I just want to start on CareSource and the relationship there. I guess, Mike, you talked about whatever it was 3 months ago when you had the last call about several opportunities that you were exploring around the distribution of the duals. Obviously, CareSource was a huge one. I'm just curious did that help or hinder other discussions with other plans? And then if you could sort of run through what the financials will look like on that partnership? And then I guess lastly, were you aware that they were going to exit, sell Michigan when you guys entered into that relationship?","Michael B. McCallister","The last one is, first, yes, we're aware of that. And I think that CareSource represents one effort to address the marketplace and it's a great opportunity for us multiple states involved here with a great player. We're talking to others. There will be -- and yes, it gets everyone's attention when you actually reach an agreement with somebody because everyone's positioning and trying to figure out how to get position for the Medicaid business with the dual-eligibles being the primary driver. So there's a lot of chairs moving around and this was a great opportunity for us to work with somebody in a key state, to start with and multiple states over time. And we haven't shared the economics of the relationship in detail. I don't think we'll be doing that. But this is the first step, and we're going to be very thoughtful and make sure that we reach this market in an appropriate fashion.","James H. Bloem","Michigan we were aware of.","Michael B. McCallister","We were aware of, yes.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Mike. And then just switching topics a little bit to the industry tax or fee, whatever you want to call it, that begins to be paid in '14, but there's discussions around potential accruals, et cetera, in '13. So I'm just curious how are you guys thinking about that as you prepare your bids, what is it now, 5 weeks away in terms of MA 2013?","Michael B. McCallister","We're not going to be having to deal with that tax for the 2013 bids, Josh. So we'll be dealing with it next year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, so you don't plan to accrue it all in 2013?","Michael B. McCallister","No, no, we don't.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Credit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First of all, I want to make sure I have the clean sort of operating run rate for the quarter. There was a negative $0.11 from PPOD due to those 2 factors you mentioned last year and then there was -- was it plus $0.06 from a change in the MLR definition. Did I get those right?","James H. Bloem","Well, again, what we said was the minimum MLR adjustment, the rebates was $0.06. And again, that's just a matter of seeing how the various states ran off in the first quarter versus the estimate that we had for the rest of it. The total favorable development was $0.03.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. I understand, but within the $0.03, was there a minus $0.11 roughly from factors -- the 2 factors last year you mentioned, the one big group and...","James H. Bloem","Actually, the amount in Retail, if you look at the slide, or the amount in Employer Group, let's take that one first. We had basically $41 million last year, and this year, it was a minus $30 million. The minus $30 million I explained is having 2 causes, those being the HIPAA 5010, which is now 98% of our claims being paid in compliance with that requirement. And the other one was -- the rest, that was between $15 million and $20 million. And then the other one was we made a plan design in one group, a medium-sized group and the Large Group business -- or in the Group Medicare business, which was basically all the rest. And that occurred in the fourth quarter.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. It occurred in the fourth quarter, but the hit for it was in the 1Q, right?","James H. Bloem","Yes, yes.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then other things in the quarter, was there a change in your understanding of the MLR definitions? United had mentioned that as a positive benefit to them as they got the clarification from CMS. And then also was there any RADV accrual positive or negative in the quarter?","James H. Bloem","With respect to medical expense ratio, no, we -- it sort of turned out the way that we thought it would turn out. And then with respect to the RADV, we had not accrued anything with respect to RADV because again, it was a revenue adjustment item rather than a cost. And so we didn't think that accruing was appropriate, so we had to think reverse.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I really appreciate the breakout on Slide 22 of the year-over-year Retail margin. I just want to make sure I understand it correctly. It looks like of the 220 basis point change, 30 was prior period development, 70 was leap-day, Arcadian really didn't have a material impact. So then the 120 basis point amount that's left, could you just sort of break out the moving pieces within that?","James H. Bloem","Well, a lot of it has to do with the reinvestment that we talked about and resetting the margin every year that Mike went over in detail. And that's really the biggest part of it.","Michael B. McCallister","Other things that are part of the change quarter-over-quarter would be the impact of leap year this year, also the PDP business that is included in that statistic. There's a lot more PDP members this year than there were last year and so that's having a somewhat of an impact on this year's quarter results, but should reverse itself as the rest of the year plays out because of the seasonal nature of how those costs are incurred.","James H. Bloem","Yes, that's correct, and so when you put those adjustments back to the 1.9, you come very close to the 2.1 that again we're looking for, for the full year.","Michael B. McCallister","And the other thing that I would quickly throw out is that the administrative spend for the clinicians that we've hired since the second quarter of last year, about 950 nurses throughout all of the United States, had a negative impact on our quarter's results compared to last year's first quarter but obviously we'll have a nice pickup over the remainder of the year and into the future because of the work -- good work that they do around helping people understand their medical spend and what have you.","James H. Bloem","Sarah, just quick for a minute, if you just look at the prior period development for '12 and leap-day as Jim said, that really gets you that 1.9.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I use your full year numbers to visualize how it happens with Part D, the 0.6 for the prior period development and the 0.2 change in margin for the Arcadian, the delta there between what you have in your slides for the full year change in margin is just the admin spend is how I should be thinking about it.","Michael B. McCallister","Correct.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then I understand you don't want to comment too much on the partnerships that you may have coming up with the duals, but just from a structural standpoint, should we be thinking about that as a partnership that's more like a service fee or a set fee where you would pay them something for access to that contract or more of sharing risks?","James E. Murray","Yes, the contracts that we have with CareSource today has CareSource being at risk for the TANF population and also at risk for the Medicare population that we've typically been at risk for. As we go through the various states that we're going to do business, there may be some sharing of the long-term care risk that exist, but that hasn't been quantified or set as we go through the various states.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Last quick clarification. In the press release, it mentioned there was a re-class relating to preparation of getting more in line with minimum MLR for 2014. Could you just tell us about how much that was of a re-class from SG&A to MLR?","James H. Bloem","That was a generic. When you look at it, everything in its total, as we get ready to get to 2014, we know that we have to get to 85% everywhere in the aggregate. And then we have the state limitations so we've made some adjustments so that we don't have to make one huge adjustment, but we're sort of on the glide path into that 85%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Just want to follow up on that last question there. How much of a drag was that accrual back to the -- or the glide path back to minimum MLR requirement, and is that something you think other companies are doing right now or are you kind of being ahead of the game on that?","Michael B. McCallister","Well, we don't comment on what we think other people are doing. We'll get a good read on what they're going to be doing for '13, again, as we always do in the fall. But again for us, it's a matter of the stability of premium and benefits is very important to us. So you don't want to get into a situation where the premium and benefits for each member is changed radically in a single year when you know that in a couple of years you have to bring everything into an 85% constraint. So that's why that was done. We're just pointing that out.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, but I guess as we think about rates over the next couple of years when you said the industry fee in 2014 and then you got some quoting adjustments and then the Star bonus demonstration expires in 2015. Is there a thought about saving some of those -- that extra profit for the things going on in 2014 to keep that more stable rather than trying give it away now?","Michael B. McCallister","Actually again, we think it's very important to continue to attract Medicare membership. And then as you can see when we have those members over a number of years, we get, A, we get better at coordinating their care and teaching them health and well-being for themselves. And B, that also gives us an advantage then that they can begin to migrate to a plan that's appropriate to them that gets to and helps their retention with us and gets them to the appropriate level of care and coverage that they need.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so how is this different than just resetting your margins to your kind of 5% target, and then how should we think about the impact of this in isolation versus the other things that are going on around MLR?","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim Murray. It's an integral part of the reset process. In prior years, as we did the reset, the evaluation of the likelihood of the secular trend or the trend vendors to play out would be known at that time. And for this year, we felt it was appropriate to rather than wait until 2014 to be explicitly identifying a part of the margin reset for us to get our medical expense ratios more in line with what will likely happen in 2014. It's a very detailed process. And again, we just think that it was wise now to, if you will, amortize the exposure that we had on the state or county basis so that we didn't have a big cliff when we hit 2014. But it's an integral part of the process and it's just -- it's a function of how much we think our assumptions around our bidding process are conservative or aggressive.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, just last question here. You mentioned briefly in the prepared comments about the 2013 rate. Was there anything in 2013 rate that made you think that today, like now, is the time to be doing this rather than waiting for 2014?","Michael B. McCallister","No, we would have done it anyway. Just all part of the way we approach it.","Bruce D. Broussard","All the factors we talked about in the past was an understanding secular trend and the trend vendors and the good work that we're doing around the 15 Percent Solution and the amount of room that we have in all of that. And as we sit here today, we've got a bunch of our markets that are in doing the bidding process and we just felt it was appropriate to step up to it. And we feel very good about what we've talked about in the past. I think Mike highlighted it in his remarks. It's a very iterative process that we are very deliberate about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a clarifying question about the HIPAA 5010 and how that impacted the development in the quarter. And also I see, with respect to your days claims payable, you mentioned that you've seen a mix shift favorable capitation in HMO products within Medicare Advantage. Can you quantify that impact and quantify the mix shift you've seen at Medicare Advantage book on a capitated side?","James H. Bloem","Yes, for year-over-year -- let's do that one first. The year-over-year on capitation, basically we went from about 13.1% of our members were in capitation arrangements and I'm talking about the Medicare now because that's where most of the Med capitation is. And now it's like 14.5%. And so that increase -- if you take that increase and you look at the total increase in our Medicare Advantage membership you see that's a good part of it and then you think back to what we've told you before about a lot of our expansion this year was in HMOs and that's where the capitation takes place. So when you look in days in claims payable, you can see that they went down about 2.5 days and that, that really is the reason. There's lots of our normal ins and outs that we show you on Pages S16, but again the biggest one was the 2.5 days for that capitation as you pointed out. And I forgot the other part of your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you expand on the impact of HIPAA 5010 and the claims inventories in the fourth quarter on the prior period negative development that you saw in the Employer segment?","James H. Bloem","HIPAA 5010 was, at that time, in the fourth quarter, it was said that it needed to be done by 9\/30 of '12. So a lot of the claims clearinghouses began their work on it. It's very important in order to be compliant with HIPAA with respect to the electronic transmission of claims. And that's obviously the way we do things -- most of our claims are handled that way. And so we had a couple of large clearinghouses that basically left off some claims for the last couple of days of the year like the 30th. The 30th was a Friday, and the 31st was the Saturday, if I'm not mistaken. And we knew they did that, but we underestimated the extent that they did that. But again, we knew that we were going to have this disruption because everybody has to become compliant. So the good news is that, that's a onetime thing because now we have 98% of our claims are compliant with HIPAA 5010.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like the completion factors in fourth quarter were lower than you thought at the time. What's the risk that baseline medical trends on which you build your pricing just weren't high enough because you didn't get the baseline trend or you're pretty confident that didn't happen?","James H. Bloem","We're very confident that didn't happen because by that time the pricing decisions are largely all made. So again, this is just a matter of making our processes and bringing our processes up to regulatory requirements that are coming. Again, we think that we're ahead of people on that. But we give a lot of transparency so that people can see where we are and then we've given you the explanation.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Am I right that this is a completion factor issue?","James H. Bloem","Yes, because it was right at the end of the year as I mentioned.","Bruce D. Broussard","In prior quarters, we talked about a 7% pricing turn. And as Jim highlighted in his remarks earlier, that now is looking like it's in the 6% to 6.5% range. So we feel very comfortable with our pricing on our commercial book. And then on the capitation, I know that it impacts negatively the days in claims payable, which all of you wonder about quality. But we will happily trade that for getting 196,000 members in HMO arrangements because that's the best way to manage those members going forward. And so that's a good trade-off for us to make, and we're happy about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Was again following up on the Medicare margin and some of your competitors that report more cleanly I think are seeing either margin expansion that was about PPOD. I was curious to see you have 30 bps of PPD improvement -- the PPD based margin improvement in the Retail Segment. Is that gross or net? Did you take any of that back into the balance? And as you're thinking about the pricing for this year, the Star bonuses and any of trends that you may be seeing in the ICD markets as far as recovery, the ortho market and\/or baby boomers as they're possibly coming into MA using more care because the Medicare benefit is richer, what is sort of your views on the trend in pricing environment and how is that impacting your forward projection? I was a little surprised at how weak the PPD came in, given last year trend is well recognized to be fairly low in MA?","James E. Murray","Well, again, we continue to use the same actuarial methodology and we use it consistently in terms of our reserving. The prior period development is gross. So we -- it is kind of what it is. But if you think about using the same methodology as you go forward, the first thing that produces prior period development is -- favorable prior period development is lowering of trend. And so once that, that's occurred and gotten to a more stable place than it was before, like we had said before between 4 and 5 then we said to the lower end of that range. Once it gets there, then you'd expect favorable development to recede. And in fact, favorable development in '11 was less than '10. So again, we don't -- we would say, to reemphasize, we use the same actuarially sound consistent methodology in reserving and we would expect then that as trends settle in at these lower levels that they have, that favorable development would be less in subsequent period but never disappear.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then to the thesis that some of the device investors have around the ICD market recovering potentially, the ortho market also picking up, are you seeing anything just in terms of utilization on a same-store basis or in terms of mix shift from the new baby boomers? Your data on membership or in general for the industry, given a large bolus of membership is coming in from the baby boomers, did not really reflect that well on Part D or Medicare. And I was wondering whether you thought about that?","James H. Bloem","We've not heard of anything that makes it really that perceptible. Obviously, the government continues to work on the pricing of devices and what their costs are, but we don't -- we haven't seen anything that would be meaningful to the kind of discussion we're having here today about the Retail Segment, for example, that, that would be any material part of.","Michael B. McCallister","Now I'll repeat what we've been saying for several years. We have a range out there of Medicare cost trends that take into account all these things you're asking about, and that range hasn't moved much. And we did talk about last year how we were coming in at the lower end of that, but we never really got out of it. So we see this whole business as relatively no drama when it comes to these sort of things. And it's been pretty predictable. We're big enough now that we have run rate scale here. And as we look at new members versus old members versus baby boomers versus non, we can clearly segment those and see different levels of spending and that sort of thing. But at the end of the day, this is a relatively predictable business with a population that is not quite as exposed to the economic changes out there as others although there's probably some pressure on them for some of their out-of-pocket spending. So it's one of the great things about this business is that these folks use a lot health care. They're in the system and once you get enough scale to where you can look at these people on a broad-based population basis, there isn't a lot of drum and that's the way I would describe it. There's not much drama here.","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, we've talked for months and quarters and years about, a 4% to 5% secular trend, and our actuaries continue to tell us that that's about where we're going to see secular trend. And then we do all of the good work that we do to try to reduce that through our 15 Percent Solution. And the other point that I would draw out is that there's risk adjustment that goes on for all these populations that you're talking about it, so to the extent that any of those populations may be younger, and in theory healthier, the revenue that we get is risk adjusted. And so I think we see a lot of stability in a lot of the numbers that we're seeing from a Humana perspective.","Michael B. McCallister","We've said for quite a while the risk adjustment process is pretty good, and we think it's appropriate to do it that way. And so when you tie all that together, I mean in the simplest terms, your expenses should predictably follow your revenues if the risk adjustment is done properly and we think by and large, it is.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just want to come back to the unfavorable reserve development again in the Employer Segment. Is it correct to say if you didn't have these technical changes, the reserve development would have basically been 0 or is it -- is that inappropriate and in fact if you didn't have the technical adjustments, it would've been -- the trend would've been more like what you saw in the Retail side, down a little bit year-to-year but not 0?","James H. Bloem","Yes, the latter.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess at this point what's your sort of expectations for share repurchase at this point, sort of any guidance there evenly spread out over the course of the year or do you, at this point, is that sort of on hold?","James H. Bloem","We don't make any predictions or we don't include in our forecast any accretion due to share repurchase. But again, if you look at the last one, you can see that we were sort of running ratably. But again, we don't make any comment or anything about when we might do that. But you look at what we've done, it's generally been moving along. We had 50% of the time was gone, we did 55% of the buys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question. Just can you share with us what the Group Medicare pretax margin was in the first quarter including and excluding the reserve development, and then just give us an update on what you're now expecting for Group Medicare margin for the full year?","James H. Bloem","Actually, we look at our all our Medicare business in one look per segment, and so we don't generally break those out. The Group Medicare portion of the Group business is a substantial portion. And we do give a group, an employer group benefit ratio. And as you know, we didn't change that. So again, I think that we're looking for things to continue to move along subject to what I said about the earnings pattern.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, I think in prior calls, you've talked about the employer -- the Group Medicare expecting sort of a bit below that average or -- I'm sorry, actually a bit above that average level. Is that, at this point, I guess, would you think it's more tracking sort of in line with that average level including the negative to reserve out?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. I think what we've said in the past is it runs slightly below the individual margin, and we've talked about a 5% margin target in the individual space.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, then just a follow-up, just on the Arcadian transaction and just your update that you expected to be around $0.05 dilutive. First question, just -- is there any affect in that $0.05 dilution from the DOJ final requirements in the settlement there that maybe made that a bit more dilutive this year? And then just philosophically, generally we haven't seen Humana doing many deals where there's upfront dilution. It typically tends to be maybe more neutral initially. Was there anything sort of different about Arcadian that drives to be a bit much more dilutive, or is there a change philosophically in how you think about sort of year 1 accretion dilution on deals?","James H. Bloem","No, there's no change in how we think about it and your question really suggests the answer. The Department of Justice is a factor in the dilution. We had a couple of million dollars and it shows on the slide of costs with respect to Arcadian and then we closed it on the last day of the quarter. So those are transaction costs, just to be explicit about them. And then we have some divestiture responsibilities that we have to do and we know that -- we're assuming that, that there will be some costs associated with that. We won't break that out. But then we're in the position, basically, where we're looking at moving the remaining 50,000 people that will be here next year onto our platform on January 1. And again, the kind of expenses we're talked about for that integration costs are basically all in the admin area. We're very satisfied with the underwriting margin and the MLRs. We think that, that we're in good shape there in terms of the acquisition and so -- and we try very hard not to be dilutive at the beginning. But there is tremendous advantage to us, to get these on our platforms as soon as possible. The problem is we can only do it once year. So the earlier we do it in a year, the more we have to carry the costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just want to follow-up on the question Chris asked a minute ago on the Employer Group unfavorable prior period development, if I understood your answer correctly you're saying that's a net number and that there would've been a positive prior period development number from trend and then negative offset from these technical factors. Is that correct? And if so, could you break out the positive and negative?","James H. Bloem","Actually, what we said is we explained the 30 negative just to bring it back to 0. If we look at the prior year at 41, the prior year at 41 favorable development is an extremely high number because of the very low trend at the end of '10. So when we look at these, basically it really pays us to take a look at what's in the 30. And so that's why we sort of broke that out for you. We're very confident. Again, when you take leap day into account and you take the rest of it together that we have a very good business in the Employer Group this year.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, Jim, but if...","James H. Bloem","Although pretax didn\u2019t show it.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","If the technical factors in the 30 had not been there, then that PPD line would have been 0? Is that the way to interpret that?","James H. Bloem","Again, directionally, that's correct. That's what we were trying to show you, that, that 30 is a nontrend, nonrun kind of thing that basically came out of the 5010 that one group change benefit design.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, shifting to membership. I think relative to prior guidance, the commercial fully insured and commercial ASO membership expectations moved a little bit and I think moved in opposite directions. Were there trade-offs between the 2, or were there other reasons for the membership change, expectations change?","James H. Bloem","I think the basic reason is, is we continue to look as the year -- in the first quarter, especially, when we see what comes in and what's still out there Large Group, Small Group, there were sort of a little bit -- about half of the difference of the 30,000 in the fully insured that you saw -- again, with several going up, we're just not going to go up as much. That was about equally split between those 2. And in the ASO business, we basically have said we're very disciplined about the fees that we require for ASOs. So again, looking at that, we made that adjustment.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'd like to explore a little bit more about the 2.5 day decline in days claims payable tied to capitation. The last time you guys disclosed how much your membership was in capitated arrangements was back in 2010, and at that point in time it was about 3%. And if I count all the risk-sharing stuff, it'd be like 22% into that number. So how do you reconcile those 2 numbers versus the 13.1% and the 14.5% that you gave on the call today? And then why wouldn't you have 2.5 day drop not create more sort of prior period favorable reserve development because that is, in fact, your reserve coming down, right?","James H. Bloem","Well, capitation is not included in days in claims payable. So that's one of the reasons it gets excluded. So when you look at that number, basically I'd said that days in claims payable wouldn't have fallen, but for the increase in capitation. So if you look out what that we mentioned and Jim was quite explicit about the HMO growth this year, that was probably about half of it. And then we also made settlements with capitated providers, maybe a little bit more that we normally do in the first quarter because again the year was over.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so can you talk about the size of those settlements in terms of what exactly happened there?","James H. Bloem","Well, half -- again, trying to keep it into days, half of that 2.5 days was the increase in the HMO and then the capitation that I mentioned where we went from 13.1% to 14.5% of our membership. Peter, I'm not tracking with your other number from before because these would be higher numbers. Generally, we were in single digits before. We used to have a little cap table that we put in the release, but then cap got to be so small we took it out. Maybe we need to think about putting it back. But the idea is we've now crept up to just around -- just to the low teens now from a high single digits it\u2019s normal capitation.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. It was actually low single digits back at the end of 2010. It was 3% if I just take the pure capitated component.","James H. Bloem","Yes, and that's what Jim said. If you go back and look at those years, the increase that we've had in our HMO population, that's really where our membership has come from. We\u2019ve continued to migrate people there and we\u2019ve continued to offer them plans there.","Regina Nethery","Peter, it's Regina. Are the low single-digit numbers that you're talking about, is that total medical membership, correct?","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's just Medicare Advantage.","Regina Nethery","Oh, okay. That doesn't sound...","James H. Bloem","That seems to low, Peter.","Regina Nethery","That's too low.","James H. Bloem","I would have said that we have 25% to 30% of our membership in capitated arrangements.","Regina Nethery","Yes.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That would be if you counted all the risk-sharing stuff that you used to break out 3 categories.","Regina Nethery","No, I understand...","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The capitated HMO hospital, the capitated HMO physician group and the risk sharing. And if you count the risk sharing, you'd be up in the sort of the 20% range, but then you have come down from that number to get to your 13.1 for last year, or otherwise, you went up from the 3% depending on which number the 13.1 correlates to and I'm just trying to understand why you didn't either see this happen last year or see a bigger difference last year and now we're seeing it all show up this year for what seems like a relatively small change compared to what must have happened in 2011.","Regina Nethery","Peter, it's Regina. We don't have the previous disclosure in the room with us right now. So what I would suggest is I'll give you a call back and we'll talk through that. But I don't anticipate anything because we're just not tracking with what you're showing as the previous numbers. So I'll call you back after the call and we'll walk through it.","James H. Bloem","At least for the record, collectively, our recollections are on the same here, but when we look -- as we're looking at each other, again, high single digits now to the low teens.","Bruce D. Broussard","And the comment about why we would pay a larger amount to a provider is because the providers had a very good year and if you look at our 2011 results, that would comport, so the liability that would have gotten established at the end of 2011 got paid in the first quarter and so that's probably why it's bigger than what you're used to before.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the Employer Segment guidance, you did $120 million in earnings in the first quarter. The low end of the guidance is $125 million. Is that all seasonality? I ask only because there's certainly been seasonality in prior years. It just doesn't seem to be nearly that large.","James H. Bloem","A lot of it is, and that's correct. Again, we were continuing to look at that because again -- but again, the first quarter was weighted down as we've talked about. But generally speaking, if you look at the years -- and that's another thing. You can really do is when you go back and look at what we were forecasting last year at this time, the same kind of thing. Again, looking to where we ended up, most of the earnings were in the first half of the year and most of them were in the first quarter.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think Jim talked earlier that there is an expectation that trend levels will return to normal levels, and we'll see how that plays itself out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just, and I apologize if I missed these 2, but just on the MA individual PMPMs being down year-over-year, as calculated in the quarter, I think you said that it was partly the membership addition of Arcadian. If we were to look at that on more of an apples-to-apples sort of day-weighted membership number, what would that number have looked like?","James H. Bloem","If it was day-weighted, it would have been very small because it was acquired on the last day. But your question, in fact, points out at how we actually do it, which is we take the average for the month. We do a monthly calculation. So that means it was there on the last day but it got no premium, but it was the yield was in there -- or the lower thing, and again, no premium but it was only there one day.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and we could do the math just to make sure we're in the ballpark. If we were to pull that out, where would that settle out? Would they be more flat year-over-year, or would they be up or would they still be down?","James H. Bloem","That was probably -- I think it's down $25 and I think that's about 1\/2 of it.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's about 1\/2 of it, okay. And then just to make sure I'm understanding correctly the $0.06 of rebate accruals, the reversal for the 2011 minimum MLR rebates that you walked through in Slide 20, I'm just a little bit confused. So understand the reversal. But just trying to understand exactly what drove the reversal. I think you said earlier it wasn't a rule change and it related to sort of how markets ran out. So I mean does that basically mean that some markets in late December you saw a little bit of a lift in trend. So you reversed that accrual, sort of ate into the buffer? Is that the right way to think about that?","James H. Bloem","Actually, the way the process actually works is these end up in your statutory filings, which are filed on March 1. So as you're cruising toward the end of the year, you have estimates in all the different places, where it's running it and then when it doesn't quite hit those, then you're making adjustment like we described.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so...","James H. Bloem","So because you watch it run out, you see what happened and then you say that's what's nice about the March 1 filing. You can see where that ends up going to as opposed to when you're making the accrual in the fourth quarter, you don't have all that information. So it's just a refinement of estimate by state.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and how does that -- the way that played out, how does that influence your thinking about trend and utilization on the commercial side looking into 2012?","James H. Bloem","I don't think it says very much, again because I referred to it as a refinement of estimate. And everything we've told you today about unfavorable development and all the other things have to do with the sort of the onetime change. And so you would expect that an estimate that you made before you saw all of the 45 buckets that it would go into, there would be some disparity there.","Michael B. McCallister","With all the dozens of statutory filings and all that, it would be a mistake to make broad-based trend implications from this particular metric.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay, and then that's helpful. And then just one, on the $40 million that you laid out on the, I think it's on slide, I believe, it's Slide 20, where you talked about the leap-year impact hurting first quarter. But then for the full year there's a 0 in that column and I might be reading too much into that slide, but is that -- does it reverse later in the year somehow that I'm not appreciating, or is it just sort of baked into the other lines on that slide?","James H. Bloem","Actually, how it works is the expense of leap-day occurs in the first quarter. So all the expense associated with it lands in the first quarter. But the premium, the actuaries didn't forget that it was leap year, that premium is collected 1\/12. So you get -- you sort of get it back or you get compensated for it as it was reflected in your pricing over 12 months.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so over the course of the year, it should have a 0 impact.","James H. Bloem","And that's why we don't show it -- we show in the fourth quarter. It goes away because we're going to collect all the premium associated with it, but we had all of these expense in the first quarter.","Operator","Last question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one here. Your Prescription Drug business is materially larger this year, and I think you mentioned that. But did the PDP MLR show any deterioration year-over-year or was it about the same?","James H. Bloem","We don't break out the MLRs again in the Medicare business. But again, we have an overall 5% margin that we're shooting for at the beginning of the year as we are now. So when we look at we've got a lot more PDP members this year, number one, and we're not -- all we can say is we're very comfortable with our 5% margin for the year with respect to PDP. So...","Bruce D. Broussard","And Mike talked about the strategy of growing our Medicare members, both PDP and MA. A side benefit of that is the ability to utilize some of our ancillary businesses and you spotted one that is an extremely important part of that whole equation.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Understood, but maybe directionally can you help us out a little bit? I'm trying to see what the impact was here. I mean you got bigger in a business that's more unfavorably seasonal at the beginning of the year. If your MLR got a little bit worse, maybe that's a way to think about it. On the back half of the year, maybe it gets that much better towards third and fourth quarter. So maybe a directional comment, if you can?","James H. Bloem","Well, there's more of them to get better at the end of the year. So that's part of the thing. And then -- so at the beginning of the year, the converse is true.","Michael B. McCallister","We don't anticipate anything unusual happening in PDP this year on this. It's not much different.","Operator","At this time, there are no audio questions.","Michael B. McCallister","Okay, thank you for joining us this morning. We think this was a very good quarter. We did beat our guidance and raised for the year, and we have faith in where we're going in the future with our strategy and as businesses develop. I want to thank you for joining us. I want to take thank all the Humana associates who are on the phone call this morning for the great work that made this quarter possible. And with that, we'll see you in 90 days. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11539":["Humana, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQ 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Regina Nethery.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Humana's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our first quarter 2017 results and our financial outlook for the full year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement.","Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release.","Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Regina, and good morning and thank you for joining us. Also thanks to many of you for participating in our Investor Day last week. In conjunction with that event, we preannounced our first quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $7.49 per diluted share, or $2.75 on an adjusted basis, and raised our expectations for the full year GAAP EPS to at least $16.91 with full year adjusted EPS projected to be at least $11.10.","This morning, we reaffirmed that increased guidance and provided the full detail behind our first quarter 2017 results. While Brian will review the financials in more detail, I want to emphasize that these results reflect the commitment and effort of the entire Humana team to ensuring our integrated care delivery strategy is executed with focus and is flexible and adaptable to local market needs.","At our recent Investor Day, we spoke of our principles of focus, integration and flexibility, which are not new to us. By consistently applying these principles in our business practices, we've been able to advance our strategy even during the extended period of uncertainty.","I'll begin with focus. Our strategy is more focused than ever as we concentrate on those lines of business where our integrated care delivery model adds the most value. Second, we are focusing on the most effective way to extend our touch points with our members including healthcare experiences outside of the care physicians and other institutions. Third, we are continuing to focus on strengthening our operating platform to optimize its productivity and dependability.","Integration is another area of emphasis and includes integrating more deeply with our providers to evolve to a more holistic care model, integrating both the lifestyles and healthcare aspects of a member's health, and integrating technology and processes to remove friction points in the healthcare delivery system, to improve the experience for our members and providers. Healthcare is a local experience. That's why our strategy and capabilities have been developed to be flexible and adaptable to local market conditions. This means adjusting the care platform based on specific market dynamics, related product offerings and the health conditions of our members. Our historical success in market differentiation are grounded in our ability to integrate our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses through leveraging our data analytics, clinical programs, and consumer-focused platform to drive health engagement and incentivize managing health holistically.","By helping our members manage their conditions and by assisting them in slowing disease progression, we are seeing measurable improvement in several of our communities of members experiencing more healthy days. We believe the combination of effective clinical programs, a productive platform, and an engaging experience for members and providers leads to an affordable product which ultimately drives profitable membership growth and growth in our Healthcare Services businesses. All of this combined help to improve the productivity of our platform and allow for a disciplined use of capital.","In closing, we believe in the strength of our company going forward and its ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders over the long-term. Our first quarter results strongly reinforced this strength. We believe that concentrating on what we do best, helping seniors with chronic conditions, solidly positions us to drive multiyear quality Medicare Advantage growth while leveraging our Healthcare Service businesses to reduce cost and improve the clinical outcomes of our Medicare Advantage members. Through integrating our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses more deeply and investing in clinical capabilities and physician partnerships, we have already made great progress improving outcomes, reducing cost and enhancing the member experience.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will also be relatively brief given our Investor Day last week allowing more time for analyst questions. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results ahead of our prior expectations, and consequently, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to at least $11.10 and our full year Retail pre-tax target by $50 million.","We also expect our quarterly EPS progression to reflect just under 30% of the full year number in each of the second and third quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to reflect the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season. I will now provide more details about each of our segment's operating performance.","Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment outperformed our initial estimates, largely due to better-than-anticipated prior-period development. Early indicators also suggest that medical cost utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running well relative to our pricing expectations. Initial indications of Medicare premium levels are also encouraging.","Finally, we have lowered our expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth to 15,000 to 25,000 from 30,000 to 40,000 while we are increasing Group MA membership by 10,000 members to 80,000 to 90,000. We do not expect these changes to impact overall Medicare profitability.","With regard to our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year, our organization is working diligently on our bid submissions which are due in early June. With the overhang associated with the terminated transaction now behind us, we believe we'll be positioned for stronger growth next year while we maintain pricing discipline. We continue to receive a number of questions about the assumptions that will be reflected in our bids. For competitive reasons, we won't be specific on these, but I will reiterate three of the key points we shared at our Investor Day last week.","First, we are incorporating our recent 2017 outperformance into our pricing and will reflect any new information as it becomes available in advance of the bid submissions. Second, we are assuming the nondeductible health insurance fee, also known as the HIF, resumes in 2018 as is scheduled under current law. This will result in a reduction of benefits and\/or increases in premiums for our members, which could create some member dislocation given the importance of stable premiums and benefits to member retention and new sales. And third, our bids will reflect the outcome of our ongoing Stars bonus efforts with CMS, and we will update the Street on our progress in this regard during our second quarter conference call.","Turning to our other businesses, our Group and Specialty segment is having another good year. Our performance is running in line with expectations, with a focus on smaller employers paying dividends as it gives the organization focus as well as the opportunity to add meaningful value for our customers.","Our Healthcare Services segment also continues to deliver profits, steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines. You will note that we have taken down intersegment revenue guidance by approximately $1 billion for the year. Our Humana At Home optimization continues apace and is proceeding a little faster than we had expected. We expect this optimization to continue into 2018.","Additionally, we are seeing lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect lower health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. This of course is a positive development for overall Humana, though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. If these trends continue, we expect that the increase in health plan pre-tax income would more than offset any reduction in pharmacy profits, though it is also important to note that any utilization reductions in the health plan would be meaningfully offset by lower member cost share and CMS reinsurance payments.","I will now make some comments regarding our long-term EPS targets that we discussed during our Investor Day last week. There have been some questions as to how we define low to mid-teens EPS growth. To provide more clarity around regarding our intentions, our long-term annual EPS target is 11% to 15%, reflecting our conviction around our strategy and the results it can deliver. As we discussed last week, our annual results will vary, sometimes performing above this range as in 2016, other times falling within the range and depending on the funding environment, competitive landscape and any prior year over-performance, there may be years in which EPS growth is below that range.","Given our integrated model, we have multiple levers we can pull to achieve these long-term results which will also vary year-to-year. These levers include, among others, membership and PMPM premium growth, MA margin changes, depending where the prior year finished in terms of our 4.5% to 5% individual MA pre-tax margin target, Healthcare Services pre-tax growth in excess of insurance membership growth to drive additional margin, and of course, capital return and M&A. Enhancing organizational productivity will also be a prime focus of the company to achieve these results while also increasing operational consistency.","Finally, before opening the call up for questions, I would like to share with you the news that Regina Nethery, our Vice President of Investor Relations, has decided to retire at the end of this month after nearly 22 years with Humana. It is impossible to overstate Regina's contributions to Humana over her career. She has not only been consistently recognized as the Investor Relations leader in our industry, but she has also been a critical partner to Bruce and me, as well as to our predecessors, helping all of us navigate the tremendous change both Humana and the industry have undergone over her distinguished career.","Her wise counsel and impeccable market judgment have guided us through both good times and bad, demonstrating exemplary leadership and representing the very best of Humana. We can't thank her enough for all that she has done for the company. Regina, you will be greatly missed and we wish you the very best.","With Regina's retirement, Amy Smith will lead Investor Relations. Amy is a CPA, who has been at Humana for nearly 14 years, serving most of that time in progressively expanding leadership roles on the Financial Reporting team, driving SEC reporting and development of external messaging on key financial measurements for our earnings releases.","With this expertise, she joined the Investor Relations team in February 2017 and met many of you at our Investor Day last week. Bruce and I look forward to partnering with Amy in her new capacity and she's very excited about the opportunity of working with all of you.","With that, we will open up the lines for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Kevin.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Thanks. I guess I just would like to reiterate those comments that Brian just made about Regina; incredibly helpful over the years. So, you will be missed. But I guess my question would be I guess it's not clear exactly to me how you're thinking about 2018 in the terms of that 11% to 15% EPS growth target. It sounds to me like you're highlighting a few headwinds there, certainly the HIF being the biggest one. Is there any initial kind of thought about that making it difficult to hit that target as we see it right now?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, Kevin, as you know, we typically don't provide even as much commentary as we've provided to this point on the following year and I think what we've provided at this point is really all we're going to say. Obviously, the HIF is something that we're very focused on and it is a headwind that frankly all the industry will have to contend with, but we are very mindful of all the elements that are going to go into our bids and you should expect more commentary as we get to later in the year. So, that's really all we can say at this point.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's fair. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Josh.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, and congrats again to Regina and to Amy as well. My question on the exchange is the Commercial Individual business. I know the MLR was running particularly low. I'm just trying to understand the performance relative to expectations and where you are vis-\u00e0-vis the PDR last year? I'm assuming that the MLR is just seasonally that low, so I'm just curious. Is that in line with what you're expecting? And what's sort of a P&L impact for the Individual Commercial business this year?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Hi, Josh. It is in line and you pointed to the reason why the MER is so low. It's really seasonality. There's a very steep claims curve in the Individual business as the year progresses given the benefit design of the product and so the MER and the profitability in the first quarter is within our expectations. We do still expect to lose approximately $45 million overall for our ACA and our non-ACA combined individual products.","If you compare versus last year, which you may be looking at, the losses were significantly higher than what we expect this year and as you know, we exited all of our off-exchange products and meaningfully pared back our on-exchange products particularly those areas where we were losing a great deal of money. And so that really explains the difference year-over-year, but the seasonality is real in this product and that's what's explaining that low MER this quarter.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And we should think of the $45 million as still the bogey in terms of what should be a, some sort of, tailwind for 2018? Whether you're in or you're out, I assume that the plan would be to fix it, right?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, true, but remember that we are excluding the Individual business from our adjusted earnings, so it will help the GAAP earnings, but we've taken it out of our adjusted earnings.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. And first of all, I also want to just extend my best to Regina in your retirement and appreciate all your help over all the years.","The question, just first question I had is just on, so give us an update on how things are progressing in terms of reactivating the external distribution channel for MA? I know that there had been some disruption that you had cited just around merger uncertainty on the 2017 selling season and just how those efforts are going to reengage your distribution heading into 2018?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. First, we never disengage from the distribution channel. I think there was just a lot of confusion in the marketplace that some of the brokers were creating as a result of the transaction specifically; are you buying Aetna product or are you buying a Humana product and just some of the confusion that would create.","And then in some markets where we were needing to sell membership, there was a lot of push on that we were selling membership and exiting, which also created some confusion in the marketplace.","But that being said, there is a whole host of effort right now of deepening our relationships with the brokers. I mean I know just in the last six weeks, we've had a number of one-on-one meetings and group meetings with our distribution channels, and basically saying we're back in action and we have some great products, and the Humana that you knew two years ago is even better than ever.","And so I just think our continued touching with them will be important. We are very competitive on the compensation side. I think this year we also will continue to support them in marketing actions and other things to help their book of business.","And so we feel good about it and we feel that the confusion in the marketplace over the last few years that some brokers used to our disadvantage is gone. And I think the strength of the company is strong, and I think we'll be able to continue to build deeper relationships with the partnerships that have proven to be successful for us.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. If I could just ask a follow-up question just on the optimization process that's playing out in Healthcare Services, maybe just sort of walk us through in terms of what the key dynamics are for that and then in terms of how that impacts the earnings and sort of drives up the ROIs? Just more insight into that would appreciated. Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's general, we are very committed to Humana At Home and the benefits that Humana At Home offers. What we were seeing, and I think this is a combination both of our effectiveness of the programs and how we've gotten better, that we were able to get the same clinical outcomes, the same financial improvements so that we would see by shortening the number of both the time and the visits and the method of the visit, and it's really the optimization of that that has allowed us to get \u2013 to leverage the great associates that we have in that area. And I would attribute that to both technology and just continuing to advance the care model.","So, in result, what that does is, is it allows us to do more with less and, in result, lower the operating costs for HumanaOne \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 Humana At Home, and that then allows us to pass those savings on to our Retail division that ultimately also helps in the ability to price the product in the marketplace.","So I would say, it's just really continued optimization of our organization and the effectiveness both leveraging the care plans that we have and then also the productivity of our associates.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Again, Regina, thanks for everything. Congrats on your retirement and hope \u2013 I know everyone hopes you'll stay in touch. Questions \u2013 first, just a quick numbers question. Brian, can you tell us what PYD added to the first quarter in terms of \u2013 obviously, a decent PYD number, was it more than you would expect to build in the guidance for Q1? And maybe I'll just stop there and maybe you can \u2013 I'm all choked up for \u2013 I'm going to miss Regina already.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","We are, too.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So I'll just stop there, and then I've got one more question.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. Well, again, the PYD, I think the $50 million is really reflective of sort of the excess PPD that we didn't expect is the way I would describe it, and that's what's been built in to the guidance. It's broadly in that range. Remember that we don't \u2013 we expect some PPD beyond the traditional reversal of the margin that happens naturally every year and that's \u2013 we expect that in our Medicare business. What we said on the last quarter call is that what we achieved in 2016 we didn't expect to recur again in 2017, and so while the PPD is down year-over-year, it's still higher than we had expected, and that's really the $50 million number that we called out.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, and I'll second everybody else's comments on Regina. Good luck in the future, Regina, in all you do. And moving on to \u2013 go back to the broker question, Bruce. Your membership in Individual MA, you've taken it down in terms of the growth that you're expecting. It was down sequentially when you look at the CMS numbers in both March and April, so it doesn't sound like what you're doing is actually having an impact today in terms of your broker outreach. Can you describe? Are you thinking about changing your broker outreach at this point given that you haven't had success in turning around the decline there, or the low growth? And then what else could you \u2013 just your plan designs at this point? Or what should we be expecting going forward?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. A few things there. First, just keep in mind that the transaction terminated in February, so anything that carried over would continue to carry over from one period to another, so I think the environment really hasn't changed, and I would say that the clarity we have now in the environment is going to be a tailwind for us as an organization. So we don't want to make massive changes in what we are doing there.","I do think we are studying in the AEP or in our bid process for AEP, our plan design and being very thoughtful around that as it compares to the competitive plan design, and I think it's going to be the combination of both efforts we're doing in those areas. And as Brian said, we really don't want to share what we're doing on the plan design today as a result of the competitive positioning of the product and the period of time we're in. So we're very optimistic about what we're doing. I know, Peter, you're looking for details, but I'm not going to provide those to you as a result of where we are in the process, but I think we'll do better next year, but I do think the plan design's an important part of that going forward.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. And remember, for 2017, just we're not talking big numbers here and on a 3-million-member base, you have small levels of dis-enrollments or small differences in sales, that can easily swing numbers 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 members one way or the other. So I wouldn't make too much of the 2017 change.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's fair. Just a follow up. Has the issue been more with the brokers that you employ? Because I know you have some of your own brokers versus brokers that you work with that are not Humana brokers.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We saw \u2013 with our existing proprietary sales network, we see consistency there in our sales and in retention. It was probably more on the extended brokered channel that we have had. A little bit of inconsistency there. And I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I think it's as much about the relationships with the brokers as it is about the confusion in the marketplace. And I think both in product design and with the clarity of the transaction being behind us, I think those two things will be helpful.","And just one other note, just on 2017, to provide further perspective on that, we did exit a number of markets on a \u2013 purposefully, which also reduced our growth significantly down and that's not reflected in the \u2013 it's reflected in the net number and it also affects the growth in an absolute basis.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, I understand. That's what I was pointing out, the sequential change in March and April of CMS (28:28) numbers. Thank you.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. Best wishes, Regina, on the retirement as well. I might just ask you about \u2013 there have been a lot of new developments since you guys had your Investor Day, but we have had a couple of your peers report and there seems to be several of them pointing to the Group MA market talking about strength there and renewed optimism. I know you were up 10,000 lives or increased your guidance by 10,000 lives, rather. Can you give us your thoughts on the Group MA and what you're seeing what the pipeline of new business looks like there? And just any commentary or perspective on that market and whether there's any \u2013 they're talking about incremental investments that they're needing to make, where do you stand on that, is that something we should think about for the rest of the year?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Hi, A.J. I would say that we are selectively looking at Group MA opportunities. There is a pipeline there. We have a team out there that is, I think, doing a really great job looking for those opportunities and we're going to pick our spots, as we've said in prior context, to make sure that we're able to earn an adequate return of capital. There's no real additional investment in 2017 for the Group MA product that's not already built into the plan. But we are looking at a number of opportunities, as I think a number of folks are, but we're going to continue to be disciplined. But we think we have a very good product that we can offer and, again, it's really going to depend on the competitive landscape, our relative market position, depending where the members are and how aggressive we want to be. But, again, I think we're going to be quite disciplined in this product.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mike Newshel.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Can you size any regulatory capital you might be able to free up from the individual market exit and just the timing on that and how long you have to wait for the claims to run out?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. I mean, you can look at our premiums and they're sort of north of $3 billion and, call it, 10% to 12% of premium over time that we can ultimately get out of our statutory subsidiaries. There is a tail there and I would imagine in 2018 we'll start pulling out some of that capital from some of the prior reductions, but ultimately it's going to probably, likely, take into 2019 before we can get all of our capital out.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks. And also given it's in the news this week that the DOJ has joined in some more \u2013 intervening in some more lawsuits with Medicare Advantage risk coding. If you can you just give us an update on the subpoenas that you've received in the past or just the status of anything you've publicly disclosed around the government looking into risk coding?","Christopher Mark Todoroff - Humana, Inc.","Hi. It's Christopher. What I would say is we've been saying for a long time, which is there's been an industry-wide review going on for quite a while and we've disclosed that in the past in our SEC filings and I would say that continues. And I think that if you look back at our prior Ks and Qs, it's got a full description of what's going on.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I think it's fair to say, we feel very good about our risk adjustment processes. We take this very seriously. We look for outliers. We've a lot of analytics around this. We do self-audits. Again, we feel very good about our risk-adjustment practices.","Christopher Mark Todoroff - Humana, Inc.","Yes. That's an important point. I mean we do very fulsome self-audits against a fee-for-service measure that we calculate and we disclose the results to the agency.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get from you, directly, what the retail MA MLR is running at now and what you're expecting for the full year? Not retail so much, the Medicare MLR because there are assumptions built around the individual commercial book and risk-adjusted receivables and so on?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes, the retail MER is disclosed in the financials because it's been pulled out. So it's in our press release. The reported MER for retail was 88.1% for the quarter.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","This includes individuals? I'm just asking.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Ana, It's Regina. Remember we did segment \u2013 we realigned the segments and we pulled individual out of that? So the individual commercial is its own segment and would not be included in that retail number any longer.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Right. The 88.1% excludes individual.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","So why is it so high at 88% now, seems on the higher side to me.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, again, the full-year guidance is out there in 86% range. Remember the PDP product, in particular, drives the seasonality of that business, so over time the PDP MER as you move forward through the quarter given the product design, that MER goes down and so that's what's driving the, sort of, the high MER in the first quarter relative to our full-year guidance.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And might you see margin expansion through 2018 or is this your normalized...","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","I'm sorry, Ana. We couldn't quite hear you.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Is this your normalized look or might we see some margin improvement into 2018, as you're targeting...","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, remember, a couple of things are going on. First from a pre-tax perspective as we indicated at Investor Day, given where our guidance is right now with the $50 million, we're at the low end of our individual MA number. But remember with the HIF coming back in 2018, that's going to impact the MER.","While the MER was slightly up, there were a number of things driving the MER that ultimately pulled it down, but the HIF offset that because you put more back into benefits. With the HIF coming back, you'll have to reduce the MER and increase the admin ratio to reflect that HIF. So the components are going to change between the admin ratio and medical cost ratio, but as it relates to specific pre-tax margin guidance, again, we're not providing 2018 guidance at this point.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks, Regina, as well. Just one big question about individual or big in terms of just a few component parts to it. Of the 200 individual commercial I'm talking about, of the 201,000 enrollments, can you give us largest, say, breakout on and off exchange, because I still think there is grandfathered stuff. And tell us what you think that enrollment number does next year?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. Well, so remember that we've exited the individual exchanges as of the end of 2017. So we're not going to have any members for 2018. For 2017, we exited the off-exchange in total. So of our call it 200,000 members today, we have about 155,000 on exchange and about 45,000 legacy members, or grandfathered members. From a state perspective, Tennessee now is our largest state, followed by Louisiana and Florida. But Tennessee by far is our largest state with over, call it, 65,000 members.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Windley.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Congratulations again, Regina and Amy. I want to just ask a bigger macro question on industry growth for 2018, and just to get your guys sense of how you think that shakes out? I guess as we look at the individual Medicare Advantage industry growth, it was either flat or declining year-to-date or year-over-year, depending on what you're looking at.","And I guess with the HIF moratorium, we would have thought that would have helped first in acceleration. So as we go into next year what data do you look at or what is your thoughts about how industry growth tracks? Could it have increased pressure as we go through the 2018 cycle, or again, what sort of things do you look at that can help size what the HIF had an impact in terms of market growth this year?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","So it's Brian. At our Investor Day, we suggested working with other outside independent groups that, call it, 6% plus or minus growth rate year-over-year was something that we could expect.","The variance, I would agree that the HIF had probably less of an impact this year than perhaps one would have thought on overall market growth. And that might suggest that next year it also, by coming back, may not have as much of an impact on market growth, but it's too early to tell.","I mean the thing that worries us about the HIF a little bit is that it's a big number and when you go the other way and reduce benefits, that could have an impact on that overall growth rate. But it's really frankly hard to tell and hard to model human behavior and how they respond to the reduction of benefits and increased premiums.","There are also a number of demographics that vary year-to-year just in terms of the number of people who are aging in to Medicare, and so that's going to vary.","It's geographically based as well. And so again it's very hard to say whether that 6% is going to hold next year and what the variance around that may be, but that's broadly the number that we're thinking about.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just real quick, kind of coming back to the EPS targets, the 11% to 15%; thanks for clarifying that. I think the components there are mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth, and then capital deployment adds around three points, sort of looking at what you've historically done. What, obviously margin expansion is baked in there to some extent. I guess what's the lever there if you're already operating pretty close to your targeted MA retail margins? I think those are already at the 4.5% mark of your 4.5% to 5% range. Is there just more upside there or more upside from other business mix that would allow you to drive margins on a consolidated basis higher?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. I think there are two elements there. The first is, you mentioned around the MA side. As I said, we are at the low end of our margin range at this point, but remember, this is a long-term target, so every year is going to be different. There will be years where we'll be below our long term individual MA range, and sometimes we'll be above that pre-tax range. And so that's where that lever comes in depending on where you are exiting the prior year.","The second element relates to our Healthcare Services franchise. We believe that over time \u2013 and there are going to be, again, years where it's faster and years where it's slower, but there are opportunities to further engage with our members and drive pre-tax Healthcare Services growth faster than revenue growth. And that ultimately leads to more margin for the enterprise. And so I think those are the two elements of margin and how they play into the long-term EPS growth.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And I think that there it is just the improved productivity of the platform we have, and that is going to be both because of their growth, but in addition a concentrated effort by our organization, as it has been over the last few years of continuing to lower our corporate cost as a percentage of revenue.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Regina Nethery.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to quickly say thank you to everyone on the call for the well wishes that they're greatly appreciated. It's been my privilege for the past many years to share the results with you of the hard work that's come from associates across the enterprise and our management team. I appreciate all the interactions that I've had with The Street, and I will miss you guys. But I know that you are in good hands with Amy and the team, and she'll do a terrific job.","So with that, I want to turn it over to Bruce.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Regina.

Our results would not be possible without our team's hard work and commitment by the 50,000 associates that are part of our organization. And obviously, we all want to thank personally Regina for her many contributions over the years in serving our company. I share Brian's sentiment that Regina has been a critical colleague in helping navigate the tremendous change both as a company, but as importantly at the industry level, and as Brian talked about, her wise counsel and judgment has been invaluable over the years. And so thank you, Regina, for all your contributions and we're looking forward to working with Amy. But again, thank you.","Regina C. Nethery - Humana, Inc.","Thank you.","Bruce D.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Humana Second 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now turn the call over to Ms. Amy Smith, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2017 results and our financial outlook for the full year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes, that replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement.","Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our second quarter 2017 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release.","Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter results and raised our full year 2017 earnings guidance. Our second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $4.46 or $3.49 on an adjusted basis significantly exceeded our previous expectations, led by our individual Medicare Advantage business and our Retail segment. Given these results, we have raised our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance to approximately $17.83 per share, or approximately $11.50 per share on an adjusted basis. Brian will discuss these results in more detail following my remarks.","The quarter results demonstrate the strength of our focused strategy: improving the health of seniors living with chronic conditions through an integrated care delivery model that brings simplicity and connectivity to the health care experience. Members in our small to midsize group and military businesses also benefit from this integrated model through an improved experience.","Key to our strategy and woven into all aspects of our business is a philosophy of fewer, bigger, and better. We are focused on identifying key improvement areas that drive the greatest benefit for our members, provider partners, associates, and our company overall. As we've outlined in our Investor Day presentation, we are doing this by focusing on integration in three major areas: integrating with providers to evolve economic incentives from treatment to health; integrating lifestyle and health care by expanding our offerings in the home, pharmacy, and behavioral health programs; and integrating technology, both internally and externally, with provider partners to reduce friction points.","We're actively advancing expanding our primary care and home care platforms as part of this strategy. We believe we can accomplish some of this through continued organic development, while some areas will require M&A. Our efforts are focused on expanding our platforms with geographic coverage to serve our members, while enhancing clinical capabilities to improve their health. These platforms will be locally oriented, integrated across the provider community, and enabled by technology and analytics.","In addition to expanding our clinical platforms, our associates are working towards a solutions that reduce other friction points for both our members and our providers. For example, navigating the health care system can be complex and challenging. If a member calls with a question and is immediately transferred, sometimes multiple times, it becomes a very frustrating friction point.","In 2016, we addressed this friction by our members \u2013 by reducing unnecessary call transfers through identifying the root causes and by creating more consumer and provider-friendly processes. That work continues in 2017, and we expect to see further positive results.","By removing these friction points for the member, a few things happen. The member is more satisfied and our response is more timely, which improves Net Promoter Score, a measure of members who recommend us to friends and family. Our associates handling the calls are more engaged because they feel they're making a difference for the member. And finally, our organization becomes more efficient, which results in savings that we can reinvest to benefit members and providers. This is just one example of the strides our associates are making to improve the consumer and provider experience.","Our service centers are focused on improving our ability to meet our members' needs, particularly in important areas such as benefits, in-network providers and claims payment. In addition to reducing call transfers, we've improved our digital capabilities which enables members to access needed information 24\/7. We are leveraging our customer relationship management platform to better meet the needs of our members based on their history and preferences, and we've significantly improved our communication practices by simplifying and personalizing our messages and refining the quality of how messages are delivered.","As we continue to evolve our integrated care delivery strategy, we have seen increased activity in our members' completion of health risk and in-home assessments, participation in our Go365 wellness platform and more effective engagement in our Humana At Home chronic care management program, which focuses on members most in need of health support.","While there is still work to do, we are pleased with our progress to-date. Over the course of this year, we've seen significant improvement in our Net Promoter Score relative to last year. For Medicare Advantage through June 30, we have improved our relationship Net Promoter Score by more than 500 basis points and our transactional Net Promoter Score by more than 700 basis points. We believe our focus on eliminating friction points and providing enhanced value through health engagement positions us well for the future as we continue to improve the experience and health of our members.","To support our strategy, we developed a strong internal framework to advance our enterprise-wide commitment to quality, risk management, compliance, and productivity. While these have always been top priorities for us, we have renewed our focus on them, beginning with the recent announcement of Sam Deshpande to fill the newly-created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. Sam and his team will help to drive integration throughout the enterprise, ensuring timely, proactive discovery and faster mitigation of risks and their causes.","In addition, last year, we created the Process Transformation Office to drive productivity throughout the organization, with a focus on improving our operating structure while also improving member experience and compliance. This renewed focus is evident on how we look at CMS Medicare Star ratings. As a background, it's important to note that the Stars program is complex, not just for Humana, but the entire industry.","A Stars score is an aggregate of multiple measures, some having to do with quality; others with process, policies, and procedures. There's a lagging indicator with scores for particular bonus years dependent on assessments that took place years previously. Many health plans, including Humana, implement remedial measures as a result of these assessments that are not reflected in the Star scores for the bonus year to which it is assigned. In addition, small movements in individual measurements can have significant impacts, positive or negative, on the overall score.","With this in mind, we've disclosed in today's earnings release that for the bonus year 2018, we now expect approximately 74% of our Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, which compares favorably to our previous forecast of 37%. We are pleased with the final outcome for bonus year 2018 and have implemented operational changes that we expect will reduce volatility in future years.","Aside from our Star results, we're also proud of our strong HEDIS measures, demonstrating the achievement of clinical outcomes, which are at a record-high level for us.","In closing, I'd like to thank Humana's associates for their outstanding efforts on behalf of our members, providers, and our company. It is through their hard work and commitment that our company continues to deliver strong performance.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million, due primarily to our better financial performance.","As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high 20% range, with the fourth quarter, therefore, comprising a percentage in the high-teens, as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season.","I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations. And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pre-tax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range.","Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development. We're also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member per month basis. Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance.","Turning to our other businesses, our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year and, as a result, we raised our pre-tax target by approximately $20 million at the midpoint of the guidance range. The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations.","We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to midsize employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital. The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent and, importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines.","Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. In addition, while to-date, mail order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new standalone PDP members appear to be lower utilizers of mail-order relative to historical experience.","Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pre-tax than anticipated. As a result of these items, we have reduced our pre-tax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million at the midpoint of our guidance range.","To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pre-tax income will more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments, due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share. These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers, and the company.","To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance. Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pre-tax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million. These results reflect significant positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of a 2016 two hours (16:48) of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business.","The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy. This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break. In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period.","Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others. We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company. As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint.","Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings in our Medicare bids for 2018, we reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year. We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members.","In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are record-high levels. It is, nonetheless, important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations. Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018.","With regards to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the non-deductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly.","We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018. The process transformation office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes.","Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018. When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth. It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high-end given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned.","Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans. As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter. Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization.","Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations. As discussed at our Investor Day, our capacity for cash M&A is approximately $3.5 billion while allowing us to maintain our investment-grade ratings.","With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on Part D. We had some information out of CMS given us the 2018 initial bids and benchmark data for 2018. Just interested if you can give us an update on how you're expecting the competitive environment for Part D next year. And then also, just on the low-income subsidy auto allocations, how you're expecting that for 2018 versus 2017?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, Scott. I would say that what we've seen is consistent with where we expected on both fronts \u2013 on both the low-income benchmarks as well as our direct subsidy calculations. And as the fall goes on, obviously, we'll talk more about what that means for us in our membership growth.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Then just had a follow-up question, just on thinking about sort of the comments you made on investing for 2018 into the MA business on the upside and then given the improvements that you had on Stars in terms of the mitigation efforts. I know in the first quarter, you guys have talked about a view of MA industry growth running around the 6% range sort of over the next few years. How are you thinking about your ability to sort of return to that type of growth rate next year given some of the recent developments?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, as I said in my remarks, we do expect to grow meaningfully in the individual MA business. We're not prepared to comment today on where that will be relative to the market. But again, I think we feel very good about the product we've put on the Street. We've really endeavored to maintain stable benefits, and we think it will be compelling products for our existing members and also future members looking to enter MA.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And, Scott, just a few things. I think \u2013 this is Bruce \u2013 first, as Brian's articulated, we really tried to keep the benefits stable this year. Second thing, we've been very proactive in reaching out to the broker community and building deeper relationships with them. Then the third thing is, as we articulated in our comments, we see our Net Promoter Score and some other things that can help out on the retention side. So we feel good about next year. We obviously aren't going to put estimates out, but I think we have a good feeling about going into 2018.","Operator","Your next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Kind of want to hit on the same point, maybe just in a little more detail. So if I'm understanding kind of how you're talking about 2018, there's roughly $0.50 of outperformance, the $11.50 versus the $11 you talked about, to invest in 2018. There's roughly $2.15 of excess HIF tax benefit that you'll be able to invest in benefits because you're not pulling that through operating earnings this year. So that's a little less than $3, and we think the hit is coming back at you to about a $4 headwind. So when we think about how that plays out in 2018, either you have to absorb the differential in terms of lower earnings growth, you have to reduce benefits, you have to cut G&A or you have to raise premium. Can you help us understand when you say stable benefit, does that literally means stable including premiums and the bulk of that differential has to get absorbed in earnings? Is that the message you're conveying today?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","So there's a lot to unpack in that question. Let me try. It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee. Obviously, it's going to vary by market. But on a national basis, I think that's a fair way to think about it. It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design. But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, the 100 basis points, that was reinvested into our product design. Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more one-time items. And so, I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance.","And finally, as it relates to the HIF. Remember, the HIF is coming back next year. And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits. It's just that we didn't have to claw it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So you're still going to have enrollment growth. You're still anticipating earnings growth even as you keep benefits stable and reabsorb the HIF of the... (26:26)?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. So again, I think it's important as we think about 2018, and I don't want to comment too much more on 2018, but to think about a baseline of $11 because we've invested this outperformance. We mentioned that in the first quarter, we would do that. We thought it was the appropriate thing to do to provide good benefits for our members and enable us to grow. And again, we feel good about where we stand. We do anticipate growing EPS. We've committed to our investors that we're going to have steady EPS growth, and that's certainly our intention next year as well as grow membership.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And one of the aspects, just to maybe pull it up a little bit, as we think about our strategy, one important part of our strategy is to continue to grow our \u2013 we refer to them as our trend benders, but our clinical outcomes, and that's an important part of our earnings per share and allows us to be able to both invest in benefits but also return dollars to shareholders.","And then second part, as we articulated today, also to focus on improved productivity and reduction of friction points into the system, and those are also included in the plan. So as we think about the growth of the organization, there's membership growth, there's clinical cost to offset growth, and then there's obviously productivity growth. And what Brian's talking about all those are sort of included in there for us to have a growth here next year with the ability to also have stable benefits.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question about the comment that you made around making changes to reduce volatility in Star ratings going forward. I think that the way I would interpret your medication strategy this year is that consolidating plans might actually increase volatility of Stars going forward. So just wanted to get some color there?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Sure. I think it really relates to an environment we've been operating in for a number of \u2013 the last few years. And as everyone knows, we had a CMS audit in 2015, and we've concluded that audit and have really done a lot of great things in the infrastructure to ensure that we have a very stable processing and the ability to operate in a much more complex environment. And I think that it's \u2013 I think it's also evident in both our HEDIS measurements as we look at those today and also our customer satisfaction ratings. Both of those have increased over the last 18 months or so. And that's just an indication of how, I think, our infrastructure is expressing itself in our results.","But like everything, we have audits every year, and there is a lot of different inspections that go on in the organization, like everybody operating in this regulatory environment. And so there will be fluctuations that come out. And even as of today, we don't know what 2018 holds because we don't know what the relative measurement for others are and the comparison side.","But really, the focus of what we are oriented to is this continuing to have solid processes, policies, and procedures in the organization that ensures that our Stars performance isn't based on contract consolidations and other matters like that. It's really based on improved clinical outcomes, better satisfaction and, at the end of the day, also better compliance ratings. And I think that's when we talk about volatility. We talk about it in that context of how our infrastructure has really improved and our ability to manage the business in a highly regulatory environment.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. First, I just wanted to clarify. When you say growing EPS, just want to be clear. Is the context there off the $11.50 plus base or off the $11 base? And then the question I had was, just if you can kind of discuss the crosswalk and maybe the process for a member. I'm assuming there's some sort of auto renewal if somebody stays on the same plan. But in the case of you rationalizing a contract, does that mean the member needs to go and sort of now select a new plan? Or if you could just help us understand the process and the differences for a member between sort of a legacy contract versus cross-walking to a new contract? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","So I'll go there first. It will be seamless for the member as it relates to the contract consolidation. So that won't be an issue in terms of the member won't see that consolidation. With respect to the EPS, I think it's important to use $11 as the baseline. And we hope to \u2013 obviously, our plan is to grow that number, and our expectation it would be above the $11.50 as well, but $11 is the baseline. And so as we think about growth rates, I think that's the way you should be thinking about 2018.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, the 11% to 15%, I think, is what you've had as kind of your growth expectations. Is there anything to consider kind of next year on sort of puts and takes to that estimate? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. So I'm not prepared to comment on where we'll be on EPS growth because that would be giving guidance for 2018. We're trying to help you and give you context about how we're thinking about the year, but really not prepared to give specifics. I think what we try to communicate this morning is that we feel good about the product we're putting out for our members that will enable us to grow membership. And we also believe when combined with trend benders and some of the productivity initiatives we're working through will enable us to grow EPS in a steady way.","Operator","Your next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I apologize. A couple of questions here, first, for 2018 \u2013 so just to follow-up here, I think there's some confusion in terms of how your Medicare Advantage bids shook out from a market perspective. So, Brian, your original 2017 guidance assumed a margin below the target of 4.5% to 5%. So can we expect that within your strong 2017 performance and the discussion of the stable benefits you're able to get back to your target margins in 2018? Or is that a wrong conclusion?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","So I appreciate the question, but obviously, we're not prepared to give 2018 guidance. What I will say is that it is true, as we articulated that we came into the year a little bit below our margin expectation, our long-term margin target. It's fair to say with this outperformance that we are above our margin target, and it's fair to say that our long-term target remains 4.5% to 5% on a pre-tax basis. But beyond that, I don't want to comment any further.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just on Medicare Advantage growth, I thought \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you had previously said I think at the Investor Day that you expected growth in line to above that industry target of 6% for next year. Is that now an incorrect assumption? And when you talk about stable benefits for Humana, given all the talk about competition, are you seeing your competitor plans also keep benefits stable in terms of what you're hearing from the market so far?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, first of all, at the Investor Day, we talked about long-term growing at or above the market. We didn't comment on 2018, and I would just leave it at that. It's too early, really, to see what our competitors have done. The data still isn't out there broadly, and it's something we'll be analyzing in the coming months. But we're obviously, as an organization, gearing up for AEP, and we feel good about how we're positioned.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Justin, let me just try to clarify a few things. Obviously, we're in a difficult position right now, because we are not prepared to give detailed guidance on 2018. And so, Brian is sort of shaking in his chair right now. So just want to highlight that. But we are committed. I just want to make it clear. We are committed to managing the business to a 4.5% to 5% long-term margin business for us, which we committed at the Investor Day. We have not lost that commitment.","Second thing we are committed to is being able to grow over a period of time annually in the double-digit growth level that we committed in the Investor Day. And so, none of those have changed. I think what we're trying to communicate is we're having a great 2017. We think the 2017 allows us to \u2013 the performance, operationally, allows us to reinvest dollars in 2018 that sets us up for a strong growth in 2018 and we feel good about that. And I just \u2013 we have to leave it at that because we're not \u2013 we can't give detailed guidance for 2018.","Operator","Your next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Lets me try it a little bit different way. You guys got nice improvement in your Stars scores, moving up 37% of our membership. You put in bids in early June. Here we are in early August. Did you know that you had the improvement in Star scores when you put in your bids? Or should we be assuming that you didn't know that and that you're going to have an incremental, call it, $600 million to $750 million of incremental earnings, as a \u2013 or incremental pre-tax earnings as a result of the \u2013 accounting for either the benchmark caps or whatever, but the higher bonus amounts that you would get.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","No. So \u2013 good morning, Peter \u2013 we did know our Stars scores before we submitted our bids. So our bids incorporate the 74%.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So we should expect better member growth then.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, again, what we've said is we're able to keep benefits stable and competitive and so we'll see where it shakes out, but we feel good about how we're positioned.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just wanted to, I guess, really come back to what others have been asking about the membership growth. When I think about your comments of stable in the context of what some of your other publicly-traded peers, it all sounds about the same. So I guess is it fair to think that maybe you have actually enhanced benefits in some plans that makes you confident or, I guess, I still don't understand the logic that makes you confident you can \"meaningfully grow the membership\" when you don't see what others are offering at this point? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, again, I think that's why we're being cautious. We don't know where our competitors are. As I said on a national basis, we're stable. I think there are clearly markets where we believe we can grow and we invested in and there are markets where perhaps we're not as well-positioned and we didn't invest as much. So we were, I think, very strategic about where we put our investments and our dollars to be able to maximize growth and offer compelling product for our members. But it is too early to assess where we are relative to our competition. But as Bruce said, we're working every angle and possibility we can to enhance growth including distribution. So again, we feel good about where we are. We'll obviously know more in the coming months as we see how we're positioned relative to our peers.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Just to add a few things there. I think, first, we feel we're doing the right things for our customers as what we've talked about on the stable side. We've never been cheapest on the market. We've always been competitive and we've always been able to compete there. So we don't \u2013 we feel with the brand we have, the experience we provide the customer, our health offerings that we have, we can compete really, really well as an organization, especially if we are in the race with the benefits side.","The second thing I really need to re-emphasize with the investors is the organization has been under somewhat of a cloud for the last few years as a result of the transaction that has been \u2013 that I think it has caused a little bit of a challenge and headwinds in the sales process, whether it was in central parts of the states where we were having to market against where it was announced we were going to sell membership to some of the other markets where it was looked upon as that it wasn't going to be a Humana product at some point in time. So as you put in context of where our performance is this year, our focus on growing and our ability to keep stable benefits, our improved orientation or relationship with our broker, we feel and that's where our confidence is coming from and the organization having clarity on its independence. And so, I think that's what you hear from the management team and why we feel that next year we'll have a good growth year.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. I figured I'd just maybe ask a couple questions related to the specialty business given the way the questions have gone so far. I want to just flesh out a couple comments that I think Brian made. First, there was a comment about the uptake in the chronic care involvement to being better than expected. I wonder if you could flesh out exactly what you're seeing there in the uptake. I know that's probably helping on your cost trend. I don't know if you can help quantify that. You also mentioned the mail-order rates not being as high. Have you been able to drill down to see why that's happening on the PBM side?","And then lastly, on the specialty, I think you guys mentioned you're still looking at home health and there was a proposal that just came out. I know some of your emphasis on home health to help your existing business. But the proposal would change Medicare the way that they think about paying for home health and I wonder if that affects your interest in doing something there in any way?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","So, that's definitely more than one question.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","All related to specialty. They're all related to specialty.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","We'll try to answer it, A.J. So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking about in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and specifically our dental business which has been outperforming. It's not something that we're prepared to quantify but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about but as I think done very, very nicely, membership higher than we expected as well as better claims experience.","Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization as we called it and the mail-order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments. On the optimization side, as we said for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time. And that the right interventions are happening. And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services, that's a member we won't touch as many times. And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care. And so we continued to see very good results, where the member is getting the right level of care and that's where we're focused. But that does have a pre-tax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges, to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pre-tax associated with that because there's a margin there.","And so again, I think that's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and more importantly for our members and their clinical health.","On the specialty side, on the specialty \u2013 sorry, the pharmacy side, the mail-order side, what we're referring to there is our mail-order rate and, as I mentioned in our low price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail-order rate than we had anticipated. We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that maybe causing some of those members to fulfill \u2013 to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail. But again, overall, it's a \u2013 there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works when someone fills at retail.","And then finally \u2013 and I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities. We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out. We're analyzing that and I'll just leave it at that. But it doesn't fundamentally change our strategy in the home and being able to engage with our members in a much more significant way in the home.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I'll just add to that, the home side. We \u2013 although, obviously, we haven't announced any acquisitions, we are working internally, as we talk about, organic and when we think about home long-term, we think about it not only in coordinating care, delivery of care in the home, which is the traditional home health side, also being able to have a home-based clinical model that is can be nurses and doctors can help people at home through telemedicine or to go to their home. And we're working on all of those different ones and so it doesn't necessarily mean that we just have to announce an acquisition and that's our home health strategy. There's a lot of other things that are going on within the organization to advance the home side. But you're right, A.J., it is all wrapped around how do we advance our membership in the long-term.","Operator","Your next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. You mentioned that MA individual was seeing lower hospital utilization and pharmacy spend. What's driving those two trends? And are those drivers sustainable beyond 2017?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, it's something obviously we do a lot of work around to try to understand what are the major drivers. We're clearly seeing the success of our clinical programs and some of our operational initiatives, what we call, trend benders. We are seeing an important advancement of our strategy there and we think that is why we're beating our operational targets, particularly on the inpatient side.","On the pharmacy side, it's something that we continue to look through. I think \u2013 look at \u2013 I think we're seeing slightly lower trend than we had expected. I think that's really the major driver. There may be some mix issues there as well in the membership that we have, but it's something that we continue to analyze.","And as we think about 2018, obviously, as we mentioned, we've reinvested those \u2013 that outperformance into our \u2013 in our bid design, we're obviously cautious about certain trends and whether they will continue. And so we're very mindful of trends that might continue and trends that might not continue. And so we, obviously, do a lot of analytics, a lot of actuaries working in figuring that out. So I think what we put into our benefit design for 2018 we feel good about.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I think on the sustainability side that you asked, I think that's really the core of our strategy when you think about advancing our relationships with our providers and moving them more and more to a value-based payment model. It is all wrapped around how do we continue to think more holistically about the individual move from a reactive type of healthcare system to more of a proactive side.","In the conversation that we just had with A.J. on the home, it's really around how do we keep people out of institutions and be able to stay where they really desire and that's at home and how can we provide them the care that they're needed there both on a reactive basis as their conditions are expressing themselves in some way or on a proactive basis where we're preventing. And so we do feel that our ability to impact the hospital admissions and specifically, pharmacy in some ways, has sustainability, and is really the core of what we're operating towards as an organization.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Sarah's question, if I may. The South Florida market, by all of the hospital reports say as well as our channel checks, suggest that you're having quite a bit of success on driving down inpatient with value-based care and all of that. So my question was a follow-up on, firstly, how much of the potential future outperformance do you get to keep relative to providers on lower utilization as well as, as you've learned more from your Star crosswalk on the revenue side? And how much you have to share with your provider partners and might that change your strategy on just doing contract as to buying more docs at some point?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, it's fair to say that when we are in a full risk arrangement with a provider, they'll obviously get the financial benefits from that. About one-third of our members are in full risk arrangements. The other two-thirds are not. About 65%, including that 33%, are in some form of a value-based arrangement where we share in some of those savings. I think it's fair to say that everyone benefits when admissions go down. Obviously, most importantly, our members benefit and so that's where we're focused. But also, from a financial perspective, we want our providers to do well and have strong financial performance because that enables us to demonstrate to other providers who are thinking about taking risk with us that there are opportunities to do very well there. And so really, everyone benefits when we're able to drive down medical costs and admissions.","As it relates to the Stars impact, it really has a similar impact. Depending on the arrangement that you're in, the provider will get a higher portion of dollars just because there's more premium going through the system. And if they get a percentage of premium, they're going to get more premiums. So they clearly share in the Stars recovery.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Ana, just to bring that a little more in focus, we find when we have a relationship with providers that are in a full risk or a integrated model, as we referred to it, we have better health outcomes. We have higher satisfaction. We have higher retention. We have higher Stars scores, and we have lower cost. And to us, it is well worth sharing those benefits with our providers because we find that it's a win for everybody in both the member side and the provider side. And we are just advocates about how that should be the future of health care.","Operator","Your next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. I know you're not giving 2018 guidance, but I'd like to revisit history a little bit. My understanding coming into this year is that you didn't take the full benefit of the HIF and throw it into benefits. You didn't take the tax benefit whereas many of your competitors took the full benefit, and therefore, I'm thinking you probably are not going to have to impact benefits because (51:01) you kept them stable, as much us your competitors. So I'm thinking your growth in MA should be better than your competitors. Yet I'm hearing you're above your target margin, so I'm thinking the margin probably has a little bit of a headwind next year. Am I thinking about this right? And also, is there anything to talk about in the group MA business in terms of your pipeline?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, Christine. So again, it is the case that without commenting on our competitors, that the tax deductibility of the HIF, we did not reflect in benefits for 2017.","And so, therefore, with the HIF coming back in 2018, we don't have to reduce benefits to effectively offset that or take an impact to margin, depending on what you want to do. That amount is something we don't have to address. And by the way, it was the reason why we did in the first place because we were concerned that we'd be in the situation and we want to try to be keep benefit stable, which we've been successful doing.","With respect to margin, as I mentioned with a previous question, we are above our margin target. We don't expect, by definition, to bid above our margin target, so there should be an expectation that our margin target will be lower next year. And we're not prepared to give guidance around that, as we've talked about.","As it relates to group MA, we continue to be selective in picking our spots. Our team is out there really pounding the pavement for opportunities. We feel pretty good about where we stand in the group MA business and looking at a number of prospects. But I would tell you that, as we said in multiple calls, we're going to be disciplined as we price that product. It's got to make sense from a return on capital perspective and from a risk perspective before we're willing to sign up, particularly for some of these large jumbo accounts.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So do you expect to grow group MA next year? I mean, the pipeline is probably pretty big or is it pretty stable?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. I'm really not prepared to comment on group MA growth at this point. Again, there's a number of prospects we're looking at and the guys are doing a really good job, but I think it's just early to comment on group MA growth at this point.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Are you complete with the streamlining or optimization of the chronic care program at this point? We saw a headline that may be you reduced by about 500 people. And is the outcome of that optimization that you would kind of achieve the same impact with lower cost? Or do you actually think you can intensify focus on the important items to improve impact at lower cost? Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We're going to continue to find the most optimal clinical model that's out there to take in both outcomes as you're asking about and, in addition, the cost of maintaining that. And frankly, I think as Brian articulated, we were probably spending some time with members that didn't want to spend time with us, so the experience is actually better.","So we're finding that when we \u2013 what we're doing is actually improving the program overall from both the effectiveness on the health side, the cost and the experience side. We do believe there's still some opportunities there. We're studying it. As Brian articulated, we wanted to walk before we run. We're seeing some maybe opportunities that we can be a little more efficient there. But that's to be coming. But I wouldn't emphasize in some of our clinical costs, it really is not only that we've reduced the administrative costs, but I can tell you that we're also still having a very large impact on the institutional costs that we're preventing.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your final question is from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, thank you for the question. I had a question with your provider relationships on CMS's proposal to move knee arthroplasty out of the inpatient-only list and onto the outpatient list. Is that something that could, if it passes and reaches steady state, impact your cost trend a few years out? And if so, how do you think about that opportunity?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I would just say that's a very specific opportunity, and there's probably 100 of those. And moving it from inpatient to outpatient is always effective but we see these kind of particular trends in many different parts of different specialties.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co.

McCallister","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Humana announced fourth quarter earnings of $1.20 per share compared to $0.63 per share in the year ago quarter. For full year 2011, the company reported earnings per share of $8.46 compared to $6.47 in 2010. These favorable results reflect the strength in key areas of strategic focus, including additional Medicare membership growth, as well as unusually low commercial medical cost trends industry-wide. ","Our operational discipline also led to further progress on our 15 Percent Solution and continued focus on prudent administrative spending. For the fourth quarter, the year-over-year increase of $0.57 per share was primarily due to expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 that did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2011, together with higher favorable medical claims reserves development in 4Q '11 than in 4Q '10. ","For the full year, the earnings improvement was primarily attributable to a lower year-over-year benefit ratio in the company's Retail segment, higher average Medicare membership and higher earnings in the company's Health and Well-Being Services segment. Along with the cost reductions in Medicare I just noted, Humana 2011 achieved appreciable progress on quality in our Medicare Advantage plans. Updated Star ratings issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicated that 98% of Humana's Medicare members are now in plans that will qualify for quality bonus payments in 2013. ","We also announced our intent to acquire 2 Medicare HMOs, Arcadian and MD Care, the latter of which closed in late 2011. These increased our provider network strength in several areas of the country and enabled us to enter new geographies, particularly in California. This progress bodes well not just for the company, it has a potentially significant societal benefit. Faced with a $20 trillion unfunded liability over the next 2 generations, the Medicare program must deepen its partnership with the private sector if America has any hope of reining in its Medicare spending. ","While traditional Medicare focus is primarily on the payment of claims rather than on beneficiaries' health and well-being, Medicare Advantage plans have proven their ability to reduce cost while improving health outcomes for plan participants. Not insignificantly, as you've heard me say many times, such plans are also extremely popular among seniors. Seniors like the care coordination, the personal attention, the variety of choices and the provider accountability inherent in Medicare Advantage offerings. In Humana's case, very few of our Medicare Advantage members ever choose to return to traditional Medicare, in part because we continue to pass along higher-than-expected earnings back to them in the form of improved benefits. ","Turning to Medicare for 2012, during last fall's Annual Election Period, our net Medicare Advantage membership growth was slightly higher than anticipated, as we previously announced. We are, therefore, projecting full year 2012 net individual membership growth in the range of 185,000 to 195,000 compared to the 145,000 to 155,000 forecast that we shared with you in our third quarter call. This, together with our expectations for growth of 65,000 to 75,000 members in our Group Medicare, brings our total expectations for Medicare Advantage growth to over 13% for 2012. ","Our standalone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans also experienced a successful Annual Election Period. We continue to anticipate full year 2012 net membership growth within our predicted range of 500,000 to 600,000. This is another robust increase on top of the net new PDP membership growth of more than 870,000 for 2011. In both years, the principal growth driver was our innovative co-branded offering with Walmart, which has the lowest monthly premium of any nationwide PDP offering. It also has one price and one benefit structure across the country, the first PDP offering in history with that strong competitive advantage. ","Among other things, this makes the plan easy to understand, a key element for retail consumers, especially in the PDP environment, where the number of plan choices runs into the hundreds. Membership increases in both Medicare Advantage and PDP were helped by our strategy of designing 2012 premiums and benefits with higher retention in mind. By minimizing change and emphasizing stability, we forecast improved member loyalty, which proved out. Beyond its immediate advantages to Humana, higher retention also helps us over the long term and our ability to increase lifetime customer value through members' exposure to a wide variety of Humana products and services. ","We've also been pleased by the ongoing conversion of Humana PDP members to our Medicare Advantage plans. Since the inception of PDP in January 2006, more than 300,000 Humana PDP members have converted to Medicare Advantage, accounting for approximately 15% of our current Medicare Advantage book of business. Among significant potential growth opportunities on the horizon is the transition of up to 9 million dual-eligible Medicare and Medicaid individuals in the managed care plans. With the proven strength of our Medicare Advantage value proposition, combined with favorable demographics as the senior population grows, we're well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. ","While Medicaid is not a traditional focus for Humana, we recognized that the landscape was changing and have been analyzing and evaluating Medicaid opportunities over the past 6 months. The result is a state-by-state strategy that offers us a number of ways to participate in this space, bearing in mind that some important aspects of the transition, such as the exact nature of the federal-state plan relationship, remain to be decided. ","Having completed 2011, our 50th year, with record earnings, revenues and health plan membership, we look forward eagerly to continuing our transformation from a product-focused health benefits company to a customer-focused healthcare company. In parallel with this evolution is our dedication as an enterprise to helping people achieve lifelong well-being. Executing on this transformation has required us to rethink the business of healthcare. In so doing, we've identified 7 imperatives for success with seniors and working-age consumers that characterize the emerging Humana that are in concert, we believe, with the evolving needs of the people and institutions, including the government, that make up healthcare. ","First, extend our comprehensive approach to lifelong well-being to engage consumers, inspire associates and supply a platform for future growth. Humana's strategy involves the vertical integration of 3 areas of focus: our core business, Medicare, Commercial and Military; businesses close to the core, including our Concentra network, comprising several hundred health centers and work-site clinics nationwide; and emerging adjacencies in such areas as integrated wellness, telemedicine, home care and quality and analytics capabilities. ","Second, enhance our innovative technology-driven, results-based approaches using rewards and incentives to foster positive behavior change. Partnering with Discovery Holdings Ltd. in South Africa, the world leader in the field, we successfully launched HumanaVitality last year, a science-based, actuary-driven wellness and loyalty program that features a wide range of well-being tools and rewards that are customized to an individual's needs and wants. ","Third, engage providers for productivity and efficiency. We are dedicated to supporting physician decision-making with actionable data in realtime, resulting in improved outcomes and efficiencies, including innovative medical home and accountable care collaborations that are already yielding promising results. ","Fourth, analyze data in ways that translate directly to better health outcomes. Humana completed a key acquisition last year that we believe will solidify our leadership in a future-oriented arena. Anvita Health's powerful rules engine provides analytic solutions that produce clinical insights leading to higher quality and lower cost, particularly for Medicare members, and will become an important enabler of our 15 Percent Solution. ","Fifth, expand our pharmacy capabilities as a model of cross-selling that produces lifetime customer value. Humana's growing pharmacy group is a model of how we're transforming from a product-centric to a customer-centric enterprise. We intend to redefine the relationship between a pharmacy provider and its customers by becoming the preeminent source of pharmacy solutions that help people achieve lifelong well-being. ","Sixth, create people-centered partnerships to reach new consumers and advance Humana's brand. As one example among many, our multifaceted alliance with Reader's Digest begun last spring has so far produced a co-branded Medicare supplement product, as well as a guide for seniors on Medicare decision-making. ","Seventh, commit to being a leader in corporate social responsibility to further enhance the company's reputation and attract world-class talent. Humana's Healthy People, Healthy Planet and Healthy Performance CSR platform is the first in our industry to be measured by global responsibility index international standards. ","Taken together, these 7 imperatives reinforce Humana's strategy and chart our pathway to the future. Helping lead us there is Bruce Broussard, elected President of Humana on December 1. At that time, he joined Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Jim Murray, and me in the newly created Office of the Chairman. Bruce will serve in that role until, in accordance with the transition plan we announced last fall, he succeeds me as CEO upon my retirement from that position. Bruce brings to Humana significant CEO experience in the healthcare industry, along with superb operational and financial leadership skills. His career has included executive leadership experience in a variety of healthcare sectors, including oncology, pharmaceuticals, assisted-living senior housing, home care, physician practice management, surgical centers and dental networks. You'll be seeing a lot of Bruce in the coming months and years. ","For today, I'd like to give him an opportunity now to introduce himself and comment briefly.","Bruce D. Broussard","Thank you, Mike. I feel privileged to be part of such a great organization with a distinguished past and a bright future. Since joining Humana in early December, I made a point of learning deeply, comprehensively and quickly. Jim Murray has served as an invaluable guide as I've gotten to know key functions and leaders at headquarters, along with strategic markets and facilities on the road. ","In Louisville, I\u2019ve spent an intensive and productive time with the clinical guidance and provider relations group, with their service operations and information technology team and with our marketing and innovation functions, among others. I've also spent time in the Louisville service center, where I observed the nuts and bolts of Humana's perfect service initiative, listening to de-identified customer conversations with our service reps. ","What Humana has done here is truly impressive. On the road, I had close-up views of our Concentra operations in Dallas; RightSource in Phoenix; our care plus operations in Miramar, Florida; Humana Cares in Tampa; HumanaVitality in Chicago; and our market and service operations in Green Bay. ","The growth implications of our well-being strategy is becoming clearer all the time. I see big opportunities ahead for Humana, which widens the provider space. Given my background, this is a place where I can, perhaps, have an immediate impact. In any event, I look forward to helping the leadership team implement the 7 imperatives Mike just described and to making a significant long-term contribution to Humana's growth and success. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim Bloem for a detailed analysis of our financial results.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Looking first at the full year for 2011, we were pleased with our earnings of $8.46 per share. As indicated on the slide, there were 2 fourth quarter factors that drove the overall improvement of $0.08 per share over the midpoint of our previous full year 2011 earnings guidance. As you'll recall, neither of these was included in our previous guidance last October.","First, approximately $54 million or $0.21 per share of prior year medical claims reserve development was the most significant factor for our fourth quarter and full year improved performance over previous guidance. Second, based on Humana's record full year net income performance, we made a contribution of $35 million or $0.13 per share to The Humana Foundation. The Foundation's philanthropic activities continue to be an important part of the company's mission, and we were pleased to be able to make this contribution to its efforts.","Moving on to 2012, we've raised our full year earnings guidance range by $0.10 per share at the midpoint to reflect the anticipated favorable impact of 40,000 higher-than-expected Retail Medicare Advantage membership. Apart from this increase, the other items of guidance remain at or near the same amounts given with our third quarter release.","Turning next to our expected 2012 quarterly earnings pattern, this slide shows the timing of the major items that we expect to impact our earnings from quarter to quarter. These items include the annually discussed seasonality factors, such as, for example, the quarterly effects of our PDP benefit designs, which exert downward pressure on the Retail segment medical benefit ratio as the year progresses, as well as the countervailing progressive quarterly increase in the Employer Group medical benefit ratio as fully insured members progress through their annual deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Most of you are familiar with the 4 quarterly impacts shown on the slide.","Just as a reminder, there is one significant item for 2012 noted on this slide and it relates to the accounting for the new TRICARE South Region contract effective April 1, 2012. As mentioned in last quarter's call, in the second quarter, we will begin to account for the new TRICARE contract on a net revenue basis, which is a change from the past gross revenue basis. Other than that, we do not anticipate any significant 2012 differences from our 2011 quarterly earnings pattern. Accordingly, our first quarter 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share is consistent with our initial view of the first quarter's relative contribution to our expected full year results for each of the last 3 years that we made it this time of the year.","Finally, now that the 2011 full year results are complete and the 2012 budgets have been finalized, let's take a refreshed look at our consolidated operating cost ratio changes over the past 2 years and compare them to the midpoint of our expected 2012 consolidated operating cost ratio guidance range. As we discussed in last quarter's call, the continued successful implementation of our corporate strategy has had an effect on the multiyear comparability of our consolidated operating cost ratio, which the slide outlines. Here are the details. First, with respect to our Health and Well-Being Services segment, our 2011 consolidated operating cost ratio increased by 180 basis points over 2010 primarily as a result of the addition of Concentra, which was acquired in late December 2010. In 2012, we expect a continued expansion of Concentra's urgent care and primary care physician strategies will add an additional 20 points to the consolidated ratio.","Second, with respect to the Retail and Employer Group segments, we lowered our 2011 consolidated operating cost ratio by 20 basis points over 2010, primarily due to the growth in the Retail segment, and now expect a further reduction of 160 basis points in 2012 as a result of increased scale, as well as the continued cost control by our administrative cost committee. ","Third, as noted on the slide, the net revenue accounting impact of the new TRICARE South Region contract I described a few minutes ago will increase the expected 2012 full year ratio by 110 basis points. It's important to note these year-over-year shifts in the mix of our administrative expenses because they demonstrate significant progress toward our goal of lowering the operating cost ratios of our core Retail and Employer Group segments as we approach 2014.","So to conclude our formal remarks, we're pleased with our operational and financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2011. The increase in our 2012 full year guidance range to $7.50 to $7.70 per share reflects our organizational competence and confidence, as well as our disciplined and intentional approach to the current operating environment. ","With that, we'll open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, will you please introduce the first caller?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Justin Lake, UBS.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question on the Employer Group cost trend. I was wondering if you can just walk us through what you saw there in the fourth quarter. It looked like the year-over-year was up a bit, and then you took up the guidance, I believe, by 50 basis points in the Employer Group for MLR. If you can just walk us through those components, it'd be helpful.","James H. Bloem","Yes, in the Employer Group segment, Justin, the main difference is the Group Medicare and how Group Medicare turned out versus what we thought originally in October. And so that's the main reason that's driving it. And if you look at the components of trend on the Commercial side, there's no change, really, that we noticed. We continue to look very carefully, and we look very quickly. We're always looking at that. We're continuing to use our pricing assumptions that we described in the third quarter call and feel very good about Commercial trend being as we discussed earlier. So the only real difference and the reason we raised the benefit ratio was, in fact, the fact that we have more Group Medicare members than we originally anticipated.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And just second question, Mike, you talked a little bit about the dual-eligible opportunity and some of the strategic thoughts you've had over the last 6 months. Just curious if you can give us any more color there on what you think the options are and what you've been thinking about over those last 6 months.","Michael B. McCallister","Yes, I'll start by just saying it's going to be a state-by-state approach. Jim, do you want to walk through the map and the states?","James E. Murray","Sure. Lots of evaluation over the last several months, trying to figure out initially whether or not the feds or the states would take the procurement lead now, believing that that will likely happen in the state. There's also some language that we're trying to get our heads around in terms of the number of duals that would ultimately be affected by all of this. We studied all the states that mean anything to us, which would be about 26 states that really matter. The good news is that in 13 of those states, the state procurement rules appear to suggest that the procurement, for our purposes, would be either the duals individually or the duals in combination with long-term care, which is an area that we're pretty interested in as well because of the assets that we have in SeniorBridge and Humana Cares. Five states, it's difficult to tell which way they're going, which would leave 8 states that will want to partner with an individual company or companies. We're in the process of working through the relationships and contractual obligations of all that, and sometime in the next several weeks or months, we can give you some visibility on all of that, but we feel very excited about not only the protecting of our current dual membership but also the opportunity to participate in the 9 million duals that Mike referenced in his opening remarks.","Michael B. McCallister","As we mentioned earlier in previous calls and conversations, we have about 0.25 million of these dual eligibles already, so we have a great deal of experience with them. So in terms of understanding that book of business, how to manage it and how to make it effective for both the individuals and for us, I don't think anybody out there is going to have a better understanding how to go about doing that. Our challenge is just getting into the distribution chain here and becoming part of these contractual relationships.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And you think you can do that without M&A?","Michael B. McCallister","Yes. We'll have more to say in just a few weeks. We have a number of things going with some of these partners. So it'll be clearer over time as to exactly how we're going to do this, but I would just leave it with you this morning is that we have a well-mapped out approach to doing it, and we intend to be a major player in the duals.","James E. Murray","And I probably wasn't clear but the partnership would be necessary for those states where the TANF and dual procurement rules are going to be combined, and we want that partner to be responsible for the TANF population.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question just on the overall, sort of taking a step back on the Medicare Advantage landscape. We've seen some pretty strong growth recently. We're up to, call it, almost 13.5 million lives now. I guess historically, Mike, you've talked about really competing with the government, the fee-for-service market and this 15 Percent Solution. Are we getting to the point where the competitors are starting to matter? Are there specific markets? I mean, obviously, South Florida, but any of your other markets that are popping up as becoming a little bit more difficult from a competitive standpoint?","Michael B. McCallister","Not really. I mean, our key to success has been to go nationwide as fast as we could over the last 5 years, and there's really only a couple of companies that have that kind of a footprint. So one thing that helps us in particular is we're in a lot of places where there's not a lot of competition because they don't have the capacity to go there. We talked about it for a long time. We started doing networking in Medicare in 2005, preparing for sort of where we are today. So, I mean, there are spots where they're more competitive than others. You mentioned South Florida. We have dozens of competitors down there, but we continue to grow there and do quite well. So at some point, your question will be very appropriate because there's going to be -- we\u2019re going to start taking share from each other at some point as we all get bigger and bigger. But right now, the opportunity to grow is very significant without having to worry about taking somebody else's customer.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then hopefully, it's a fair question for Bruce, but on the 7 imperatives, I think, Bruce, you mentioned you thought you could make an immediate impact on the provider side of the company's growth. I'm just curious, maybe you could put a little bit more color around that. Is that sort of Concentra-like type of growth, or are there other things you had in mind?","Bruce D. Broussard","No, I think in the immediate future, it'd be helping with the Concentra opportunities that are there along with the physician -- primary care.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ana Gupte of Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just wanted to explore your Medicare margins for the quarter and then get some color on what that might look like for 2012. The first question is on your PMPM for Medicare. It looked like it was sequentially down. Is this typical in terms of some sort of seasonality? Were you expecting this?","James H. Bloem","Well, we continue to add members, and again, just looking at things in the way there, we don't see anything out of the unusual there. We did close the MD Care on the last workday of the year, on Friday, the 30th of December, and those are in those numbers as well.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Then on the Retail side, so you mentioned that your employer-based Medicare trend came in higher, but there's been a lot of data, third-party data and even in the media that the Retail trend, Part D trend is fairly low. Can you comment on the drivers of that, where you bid in June relative to what trend is at right now, was your expectation higher? And then just following up on the drivers, to what extent do you think this is sustainable because of what you're doing relative to fixed-income seniors possibly pushing back on using care or docs temporarily being less over treating or whatever?","James H. Bloem","Ana, we're not really seeing any real differences than what we've outlined over the last 90 days about either the Medicare trends, either in the Group or in the regular, the individual business and again, we're not seeing any real changes in the utilization as a component of trend.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So for you, right now, I mean, so third-party data on S&P is clearly showing Medicare trend has been weakening, and so you're saying you're not seeing that all?","James E. Murray","So this is Jim Murray. The last data that is available is the 2010 Medicare fee-for-service file. And as you might expect, a lot of our folks, our actuaries are ripping through that data. And from what they're telling us, they're seeing that the trends are around 4% in 2010, which is pretty similar to what we've been saying for a number of years in terms of where the Medicare fee-for-service trends ultimately restate to. I think in the past investor calls and even in some of these earnings updates, we share with you all the restated prior years to demonstrate that somewhere between 4% and 6% is the historical Medicare fee-for-service trend, and so the last data point that we have would suggest that 4% is the most solid number out there. I don't have any visibility in 2011 or '12, obviously. So we assume that will play out similar to what we've been saying all along.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then your 750, you do not include prior year development. Any reason to expect that you would see less or more in 2012?","James H. Bloem","Yes, you're correct. We do not anticipate in our guidance any favorable development. But again, we continue to use consistent methods and all the actuarial principles to compute the reserve each period. So we then we'll see what turns out in terms of how things would restate. But again, we're not seeing a lot of difference, as I started with.","Michael B. McCallister","Let me clarify Jim's statement. We have a lot of clarity into our own cost trends in 2011. As we've been telling you all throughout the year, we've been at the lower end of our 4% to 6% historical range. So sure, there's been some softening of Medicare trend, but it's still within the ranges we've been talking about for a long time.","James E. Murray","Yes, my remarks were totally towards Medicare fee-for-service, and it didn't bring into the discussion our success on the 15 Percent Solution, which we've talked about in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question on your Medicare enrollment guidance. It looks like the CMS Medicare enrollment data is currently higher than what your guidance is for the year. Have you talked about that discrepancy?","James H. Bloem","Well, generally speaking, Kevin, the way we keep our own records and the way we watch what we get every day and we get our information from the field, there's a general correlation, obviously, but there's always timing differences with what CMS says. So we always say -- we tend to look at CMS data that everyone sees and says directionally, that's the way our enrollments are moving. But in any given period, they're not exactly directly comparable.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So you're seeing something different than what CMS is doing. You think CMS\u2019 numbers will catch up to your number eventually.","James H. Bloem","Yes, we have a consistent way of doing our own numbers. And so whenever we give the numbers that we give in earnings press releases and at conferences, that's computed on what we're enrolling and what we're seeing and what sales we're seeing from our sales force and not from CMS.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on Slide 6 of the deck, which is pretty interesting. I mean, how do you view the trajectory of your 15 Percent Solution in 2011, particularly in the 107, 115 books? Is there something structurally there that's making it harder to show continued progress, or is there something that you can point to that, in particular, would have some impact on those markets?","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim Murray. The inclusion of new members and kind of the restarting of where we have to go with those new members, one of the things we probably ought to start to think about is showing kind of a same-store so that we can show you the 15 Percent Solution on members that we've had for a period of time. New geographies would impact this to the extent we grow in a market, in our PPO or private fee-for-service business in one location that we haven't been would impact that. And we saw that, and going forward, we probably need to help you with that. But we feel very good about the progress that we're making on the 15 Percent Solution.","Michael B. McCallister","There's 3 key drivers to the 15 Percent Solution at a high level. One is the maturity of a marketplace and how much management there has actually been in a senior population in a community. That's one. Two is how fast and how big we're growing because as we get new members, it takes a while for them to mature, settle into the systems and the processes and for us to do our data analytical work and determine all of that and then lastly, where the providers are in terms of their actual capabilities, and so that varies all across the U.S. So this is something that will always be a piece of work in front of us. There's no endgame here. And the more you grow, the more challenged you are in terms of keeping that 15 Percent Solution going forward. So those are all actually good things, and we're finding great success over time and even in these brand new markets in terms of applying Humana Cares and a number of other clinical approaches to this population. So we're very confident that you can manage care effectively enough across all these places to make the business work, and where you can get really solid management and some history volume, you can really start having some great numbers. So the story is actually very good, but it's always a piece of work that's in front of us.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So if we were to see on that same-store basis, we would see relatively consistent progress across all 4 buckets? Is that...","Michael B. McCallister","That's a good question. We'll try to figure out how to tease out some same-store data going forward to give you a little better insight about the timing of some of this.","James E. Murray","Yes, the other thing that I would point out that you all ought to consider is the growth in membership in network-based products and where we're going with that. You may have noticed in some of the data that we put out that of the 175-or-so-thousand members that we grew in the AEP, 130,000 of those were in HMOs. And if you look at where the HMOs are in that slide, it's very impactful. And so over time, what you're going to hear us begin to talk about more so than the 15 Percent Solution is integrated care delivery models, and that's something that we're really, really focused on as an organization because tightly linked models of care that's enhanced by information and aligned incentives is where the future is, and you can see that on the slide. And so we're really encouraged by the growth of the HMOs this last AEP.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Kevin's question about the enrollment. And I understand that you're calculating it in a different way, but when I look at the seasonality of enrollment growth in past years, it looks like there's about 77% up through February, which captures the selling season, and another 23% through the rest of the year. So I'm wondering if there's any reason to believe that the seasonality of growth would be different because if it keeps that pattern, then it would be about another 75,000 members in the back half of the year.","James H. Bloem","Sarah, again, we use the consistent method that I mentioned before, and we are pleased that that percentage of what I'd call -- what we got in the AEP is higher than last year. And that's very gratifying to us. But again, we use the same kind of methods in terms of how we report from the field, how we enroll people and we're using our own internal data. And then again, directionally, we think that the CMS data is always generally directionally right for us but doesn't necessarily correlate exactly with what we report.","James E. Murray","We had a successful rest of the year or ROY last year, and this is early -- it's January or February. And so we'll see how this year plays out relative to what we did last year. But again, it's very early for us to be more fulsome.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a question here on rates. I'm sure you saw the GAO report that came out recently looking at a different way to calculate some of the coding adjustments. I was wondering if you could comment whether or not you think that those could be incorporated into either preliminary or final rates and just any sort of commentary that you have on that report.","Michael B. McCallister","Yes, we read some of that GAO report. And you know that in prior years, there was some amount of an adjustment that was made. It's anybody's guess as to what we might see this coming year in terms of some adjustment for that. There's a lot of dialogue out there that I read from a lot of you in terms of which way CMS might go this year. Regardless of how CMS goes, we feel very comfortable with our 15 Percent Solution and the work that we do to make sure that we get paid the right amount for the risk that we assume. And we feel comfortable with the value propositions that we provide the members in terms of benefits and premiums. And so if there's a coding intensity adjustment, that's a part of this year's rate structure, we'll just deal with that. We feel very good about our ability to manage through all that as we have in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here. Can you comment on how profitable new Medicare Advantage membership is relative to the profitability of the overall book? You said it takes a while for the 15 Percent Solution to kick in. But on the other hand, you\u2019ve gained a lot of HMO members, which I would assume would be more profitable to start with. And then on the PDP, you're gaining a lot of membership. Can you tell us how much of that is low-income seniors? And is there any risk because the risk adjusters there aren't as good as they are for Medicare Advantage, that the low-income senior population you're gaining with PDP could be a challenge?","James E. Murray","So there's a couple of questions in there. A new Medicare Advantage member for us comes in and is initially generally favorable in terms of our results. Over time, as that member, depending upon the kind of network or product configuration they are in and the work that we're doing around the 15 Percent Solution in terms of our results of the company would likely improve not only the 15 Percent Solution but also the risk coding and getting paid the amount for the risk that we assume, so over time, it improves. But when we grow, we don't ever see a situation where we grow and a member that comes in and is new would not be considered favorable for us as an organization. I'll move over to the PDP. We feel very good about the risk profile that we've got last year as an organization around the Walmart plan. I think we've probably got 450-or-so-thousand LIS members, and we feel very good about that membership and look forward to gaining more for the remainder of the year. So in terms of -- the risk scoring of members, we feel, is fairly well calibrated, and so we'd love to take all comers.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then are you still assuming about a 5.5% margin overall for MA? It looks like you didn't change that.","James H. Bloem","It changed by 10 basis points, again, now that we've seen all the enrollments. So yes, we were very close, and now we're at 5.4% as a midpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Windley of Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A kind of a follow-up. In light of all the transactions in the MA space of late that have kind of a brick-and-mortar strategy, I wondered if you had some specific investments or strategies that you could call out around tweaking the Concentra model to be more MA-specific.","Michael B. McCallister","That's something that's going to be taking -- it's going to take a while for that to ultimately play out. I mean, I said in the beginning on Concentra that it was a platform for managing, and they've been out -- we're doing things like relocating some of the facilities into places that lend themselves a little more to Retail sort of customers but not getting too far away from the existing business space and that sort of thing. There's been some acquisitions of some practices and some urgent care centers. So they're getting on with their business of becoming a much bigger player in the urgent care space as well as primary care both in terms of new locations and moving some of the older locations to hit both targets. So that's all well underway, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to do more of that. They are also deeply involved in the strategic approach around how we approach every market and where Concentra is going to play in conjunction with other risk-taking doctor groups and\/or other network development activity. So they're now very deeply engaged with the rest of the company in terms of how they play in the strategy, as well as getting on with the business that they had and making it much more amenable to the Retail consumer space. So it's full speed ahead there, and we're going to look for more opportunities to expand that.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the group MA, you raised the guidance a little bit there. I wanted to get clarification. Is that business already in hand or business that you are expecting to close? And I guess I'm just looking for pipeline beyond that guidance raise as to whether we could expect that there might be more within the 2012 year.","James E. Murray","So most of the group business is a January effective date, but there'll likely be some smaller groups that either have more of their retirees become part of our program or where we win. It won't be a significant number. There is a pretty nice pipeline developing in the group space, though, some midyear but mostly with a January effective date that looks pretty interesting to us.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jim, if I could slip in one more on that. Jim, do you believe that you need a partnership with a Commercial player, and are you considering any alternative to the CIGNA deal in light of the HealthSpring transaction?","James E. Murray","We've been pretty successful in the past without having a Commercial player. I think we just recently advised CIGNA that we wanted to term our relationship, but I feel very good about the pipeline and the lack of need for having a Commercial player to go forward with.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to return to the question of the MA rates for 2013, and maybe if you have some thoughts when putting all the pieces together where you think preliminary rates may come in. I know that, Jim Murray, you've been generous in the past to help us think about a bogey, so interested in your thoughts on preliminary rates for 2013.","James E. Murray","Scott, that was shameless. I got yelled at for doing that in the past. It's anybody's guess in terms of what might happen here, but we've read a lot of your reports, and we\u2019ve studied what we think might happen. And again, I'm going to go back to what I said before because this is what Regina tells me I'm allowed to say. Regardless of how it comes out, I think that we'll be fine. We don't see anything that scares us, the 15 Percent Solution and the work we do around accurate coding and where we see trends heading would suggest that we'll continue to be able to provide the seniors that we serve with very good benefits and very low premiums. Again, I'll say what I say every year, so I'll do it again, I'm a broken record. At the end of the day, these numbers are all over the map. The assumptions have historically proved to be wrong relative to medical inflation, for example, and all these projections out of CMS. So all of that finds its way back into the map over time. And while there's always some short-term noise here, the long-term viability of this program is a simple function of the fact that you have to outperform medical cost trend in the traditional Medicare program to win here. As long as we do that, we win.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I just had a follow-up just on Arcadia, and I know that deal was initially expected to close by the end of 2011. I think it hasn't closed yet. So maybe an update on when you're expecting that to close and how you think they performed during the Medicare annual enrollment period.","Christopher M. Todoroff","This is Chris Todoroff. I think what we can say is we expect that to close first half of this year. We're still in the regulatory approval process.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Then in terms of any color on the AEP for them?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. Generally, right around where the membership was that we acquired but nothing significant one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on the quarter and then one about next year. First, in terms of the share repurchase, it doesn't look like you did get any share repurchases in the fourth quarter. And also, we were expecting to see marketing expense in 4Q 2010 go up because you had a lot of, frankly, earnings, so that you were able to spend a little more. Did you spend a little more in the fourth quarter of 2011 like that in terms of the extra marketing, and can you quantify that for me? And then in terms of going forward, can you describe Medical loss ratio minimums for Medicare and how you think that discussion's going to play out and what do you think that's going to happen in terms of how that's going to be assigned, whether it's going to be assigned by age plan or by state or your overall book?","James H. Bloem","Well, let's start with share repurchase. You're correct. We did not do any share repurchase in the fourth quarter, but we did a lot of share repurchase in the third quarter. And so if you look at the total year of how we deployed capital, we're very pleased with how the year went. We did $350 million of CapEx. We did $225 million of acquisitions that we've closed on, and as mentioned, we have 2 more that we're still working on. And then we initiated a cash dividend last year. So if you look at those 3 first, the first 2, particularly the CapEx and the acquisitions, those obviously raised the value of our company, and that's really what we try to do. Then we were very pleased for the first time last year, as I said, to be able to introduce a cash dividend. And so what's really left over then is the share repurchase. And the share repurchase, the board made an authorization back in April that we would do $1 billion of share repurchase by June 30, 2013. So we're about half done with that, and the time is about a third run. But again, I want you to see it in terms of -- or we'd like you to consider it in terms of the balance of those things, the things that raise the value of a company. We spent about $600 million on those. And if you look at share repurchase and the cash dividend, another $600 million on that. And that's about the amount of the dividend that we took from the sub. So again, we feel very good about share repurchase. I forgot what the next one was.","James E. Murray","The next one was did we spend any more money in the fourth quarter to help our 2012 enrollment, and the answer to that is yes. When the fourth quarter comes around and we have some visibility in terms of where our value proposition is relative to the rest of the competition and we have the ability we've had in the last several years, we feel it's prudent to invest in marketing dollars that drive higher AEP results. And our talking today about an extra 40,000 is a direct correlation to that extra spend, and I think your last question was the minimum medical expense ratio in Medicare. We're doing lots of studying and scenario planning, trying to figure out whether it's going to be on a county basis, on a age contract basis or a state basis and doing lots of calculations, which include the implications of federal taxes on the MERs that exist by each of those different scenarios. And we frankly feel pretty good about what the application of that minimum medical expense ratio might mean for us regardless of the solution or the rules or regulations that might ultimately come out. We feel it's pretty manageable. And again, we await what the regulators will say about the actual application. But regardless of the direction they go, we feel reasonably comfortable that it's very manageable.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just back on the share repurchase, so there was nothing that kept you out of the box from buying shares in the fourth quarter?","James H. Bloem","Well, generally, we don't comment on anything that would keep us out of the box. So again, I would -- but I would like you to think about it in terms of how I said in terms of a balanced approach to capital deployment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I apologize if this was somehow covered before. But what are you guys expecting in terms of utilization volume growth for 2012 on the Medicare and Commercial side, a continuation of roughly what you saw in '10 and '11 or an increase?","Michael B. McCallister","Basically a continuation. On the Medicare side, we feel, again, there's a lot of consistency year-over-year in terms of that utilization and that trend.","James E. Murray","On the Commercial side, though, I think we've guided to that it might revert back to the 2009 norms, and time will tell -- or somewhere between what we experienced the past year and 2009. Time will tell whether that's a good assumption. And that's part of the reason for the change between this year's actual results and the guidance that we put out there, and we've shared that with you before.","Michael B. McCallister","Yes, in the last quarter, we said we\u2019d go 50% of the way of what we did last year.","James E. Murray","Correct.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you comment on the pricing side on the Commercial business? As you've come into the new year and finished, obviously, a lot of renewals for 2012, how you see the price competition shaping up in various segments of Commercial?","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim Murray. I think Jim walked you through last quarter that 5% was our claims trend, anticipating it going to 6% to 6.5% in '12, and we're using 7% for pricing. So put that aside. On the Small Group side, we're seeing some nice growth. This past year was favorable, and as we look forward, we think we'll see some nice growth. It's a competitive marketplace, but we're anticipating growing. On the Large Group side, fully insured, a little bit of competitive environment in the what we refer to as the portfolio space. That seems to be a lot of real arm wrestling in that space. When you put those 2 fully insured pieces together, I think you saw our guidance today that we think we'll grow somewhere around 50,000 to 60,000 fully insured members. So that's a good thing. On the ASO side, it looks like we'll probably shrink around 50,000 or so. So our Commercial membership, we think, will be pretty much flat. It's good that we're growing or anticipate growing in the fully insured space, and so it's a competitive environment but nothing that we see craziness in terms of.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Carroll of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just want to come back to the Employer segment results and get a clarification. I guess which was the bigger contributor to the seasonally weak fourth quarter results? Was it the mix of Group MA business, or was it more the minimum MLR impact from your -- on the Commercial side?","James H. Bloem","Yes, Tom, it was the minimum MLRs and the rebates associated with that.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So that was the bigger piece then?","James H. Bloem","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the cost advantage versus fee-for-service. I mean, if I look at that chart recognizing there's some moving pieces around number additions and a number of other things, it looks like your cost advantages improved but pretty modestly, something like around 11%. But of course, that's in the context of a fairly significant negative spread between the rate increases you've seen in cost trends. So if I want to think about sort of the improvement that you've seen over the last couple of years, what would be the right number to use in terms of that negative spread that you've seen with your pricing not matching the cost trend?","James E. Murray","I'm not sure if this is how you're getting after the question, but I'll try this. When we do our bids every year, we anticipate what we think trends are going to be in the fee-for-service environment that we -- what we call secular trends. And then we create what we call trend benders to try to offset the impact of that. And in the past, if you think that -- we think secular trends in Medicare runs 4% to 5%. We generally see trend benders every year that are somewhere around 2% to 3%. And so you can see that we make up 2% to 3% or 200 to 300 basis points on that schedule for our book of business. And the only other thing that we talked about earlier is the geographical implications of that schedule. So we feel confident that each and every year, we can get trend benders as we refer to them and we put them into the bids of 200 to 300 basis points. When we get those trend benders and it all plays out, we\u2019ve talked about our 5% target in the past, and you've seen what's happened in prior years in terms of our ability to do a little bit better.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I know this is not hugely important to the overall business, but the other businesses segment in the quarter, it looks like the top line, particularly in the Military Services line, ticked down pretty meaningfully relative to the third quarter. Is there anything in particular that's going on there? And potentially, did any of the business move to ASO in Q4 that you might want to point out? Just generally, what's going on there?","Michael B. McCallister","Yes, I think that\u2019s generally, if you look at the mix of the business, there is some of that. They're also getting ready for the new contract, and they're in discussions with how that's going to be transitioned with the Department of Defense.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Simpson of Morgan Stanley.","Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just not to beat a dead horse, but I just wanted to understand, the Employer Group MLR in 2012, there were a couple of comments, just to make sure we have these all right. You had a higher rebate impact in Q4, which would sort of suggest that trends were a little bit better on the Commercial side than had been baked in initially, driving the rebates a little bit higher. And then I think the comment was that the mix shift to Group would really be responsible -- to Group MA would really drive them next year. So I guess are those both correct? And the magnitude of the mix shift, it doesn't look that dramatically different from what you were originally expecting. So just trying to tease out exactly what's driving that 50 bps.","James H. Bloem","Well, we were in the range, and we lowered the bottom of the range. This is on the Group Medicare part in terms of the membership gain. So when we saw, we actually -- in October, we gave a number, when we saw what actually came in. You're right. The midpoint sort of only goes up by 2,500 or 5,000, but when you look at what we were looking at in October, before we enrolled anybody, we knew we had one large account, but we didn't know how many people would come, how many people would elect us or elect to stay with them and lots of other things. So when we finally got everything together, and this is true of all the guidance, really, if you think about what we know on October 31 and what actually happens, that accounts for, really, all of this. So in terms of that part, yes, that's the major reason.","Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Walmart co-branded offerings, I didn't hear, maybe I missed it. I apologize if I did. But did you give an update on just how that was tracking on the MA side this year?","James H. Bloem","We didn't share that with you, and I frankly don't have that information available.","Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I mean, is this the kind of thing where if it pans out, we may see more of these relationships as we look into the coming years? Is this something you're working on with other potential cosponsors?","James E. Murray","That would be something -- when we talk about integrated care delivery models and skinnier networks, the possibility that there would be Walmarts and others that we might focus on having a preferred network situation or a par versus non-par situation going forward is something that is clearly -- we're evaluating that as we speak.","Michael B. McCallister","But, Doug, there's no reason to believe that we'd see the dramatic change in MA that we did with PDP with a product like that because you're looking at 2 totally different sort of products and geographic availability and a lot of different things. So we\u2019ve all been running with that co-branded MA plan. But, Doug, don't be thinking PDP-like when you think about how it might grow.","Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, sure, no, that's fair. And I think there were some initial comments given about, if I have my numbers right here, about 300,000 PDP members since '06 you've seen convert into the MA offerings. And I know you don't want to comment on any one relationship or area, but just as you think in general about the seasoning of the MA offering within the senior population, are those conversions at all coming more easily, or was it first-movers so they're more challenging now? Anything you could give us as to the relative pace of that transition would be great.","Michael B. McCallister","We probably won't get into too much detail. I would say it's kind of steady as you go. What I've been saying since the very beginning, all the way back to 2006, that having that Humana card in their pocket for their PDP and developing the relationship was going to really set up an opportunity to move people over time because it's a better value proposition to be in an MA PD than it's ever going to be to have a stand-alone PDP connected to anything else. So the value proposition is strong enough to, over time, have people go over there. It hasn't been a primary focus of ours. It's something we're interested in, and we certainly try to move them or basically talk to them about their opportunity, at least. But to me, it's more of having a relationship that matures over time, has a move over time, and we've just seen good evidence of it, and I think we're going to see a lot more of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Boorady of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, just, Mike, if you can clarify a little bit. I think in response to a question on the duals, where you were referring to the potential to strike partnerships, you talked about the need for distribution. And I just wasn't clear there what distribution were you referring to, distribution to the individual or sale of the products or relationship with the state, that type of distribution, or were you referring more to the medical delivery or network side of things?","Michael B. McCallister","No, it was the relationship with the states I was talking about.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the medical capabilities that you need to manage those populations, do you feel like a partnership would be required there as well? Or in those states, have you assessed your capabilities, and do you feel like you have the medical delivery infrastructure requisite to make money in that business?","Michael B. McCallister","Well, there's always work to be done to build the infrastructure out. We do it all the time. But the answer is when it comes to the Medicare components of all this, we're pretty well positioned virtually everywhere to do that. Where we do need help is on the mothers and the kids, and that's where we're looking for some partnerships with people that are good at that. But in terms of taking on new dual eligibles in the states we were talking about and being able to take on the duals ourselves over 65, I mean, clearly, we're positioned to do that. I mean, but again, there's always work to be done. There some places we're stronger than others. So that's the kind of thing you have to do to execute on this properly, is you have to lay out what that looks like and make sure -- I mean, it sounds like management 101, but you have to apply the resources to make sure you fill your gaps. It's that simple.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, and then my follow-up question just on the overall underlying unmanaged Medicare trend, I wonder, what's your view on what the unmanaged Medicare medical trend was in 2011, and by how much were you able to bend the curve with your 15 Percent Solution?","Michael B. McCallister","Well, I mean, it's always been our belief that we had enough insight into what would likely be happening on the Medicare fee-for-service side because we had a lot of private fee-for-service business which looked a lot like traditional Medicare. And the trends there, what we've always seen, always somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. So when I hear someone else, I don't care who they are, talking about how trends are somewhere different or somehow different to that, I always take a bit of a jaundiced eye toward that. And we wait for ours to develop, and ours always tends to be in that range.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, I guess my question is, how much progress are you making on the 15 Percent Solution? And a good way to measure that is...","James E. Murray","Charles, it's Jim. So earlier, we talked that the last data point that we have any visibility on for the fee-for-service, Medicare fee-for-service unmanaged population was 4%, and that was in 2010. When we did our bids for 2011 and 2012, we talked about the fact that we used secular trends of 4% to 5% when we did our bidding work. And we built in trend benders in each of those 2 years that was somewhere in the range of 200 to 300 basis points to offset that trend that existed in the environment, and so we've seen progress above that 200 to 300 for each of the last 2 years, and we'll see how that all plays out for our 2012 results and the bid process that we went through last year for 2012.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In the 200 to 300, what I'm trying to get is, sort of how much is Humana's success in the 15 Percent Solution versus just softer overall industry trends?","James E. Murray","We believe that's all Humana. On a regularly scheduled Friday, from 9:00 to 1:00, we have a very exhaustive trend and cost committee meeting, where we go through and we create schedules called trend benders, and every Friday, for 4 hours, we go through and try to evaluate how Humana did against those targets that we built into the bids. And lo and behold, we think that we're making very good progress, which demonstrates itself into the 15 Percent Solution and, frankly, demonstrates itself in the value that we're able to offer to the seniors, the benefits and the lower premiums, and that's kind of the bottom, bottom, bottom line.","Michael B. McCallister","I think you saw that evolve just in this last enrollment period. Basically, what we said going into it -- our goal was to be as stable as we possibly could with benefits and premiums, and that's a function of being able to manage whatever trend we have. And so we were able to do that and you saw the result. I mean, we had terrific retention, and our net membership's growing very, very nicely.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. McCallister for closing remarks.","Michael B. McCallister","Well, thanks for joining us again. 2011 was our 50th anniversary year, and it was great that we, in fact, had the best performance in the history of our company during that year. Medicare enrollment continues to grow nicely, very good results based on powerful brand, better retention and a terrific sales capability that really understands the Retail market. We think 2012 is going to be another good year, and let me finish by thanking all the Humana associates that are on this call for making these results as good as they are.

And welcome to Humana's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Amy Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Amy Smith","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our third quarter 2019 results and our updated financial outlook for the full year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the line for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Our Chief Legal Officer, Joe Ventura will also be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our third quarter 2019 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all also available on our Investor Relations site.","Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release.","Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce Broussard","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.03 for the third quarter of 2019 and raised our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $17.75, primarily reflecting improved results in our retail segment. Our year to date results through the third quarter of 2019 including our significant individual Medicare Advantage membership growth now projected to exceed 0.50 million members for the full year.","Demonstrate the value of our products and services, the strength of our brand with consumers and our progress in simplifying the healthcare experience for our members, providers, broker partners and associates. The management team continues to maintain its focus on operational excellence, ensuring our operating results remain consistent despite potential pressure of significant membership growth. While we celebrate these strong results, we also recognize healthcare will continue to evolve and will require an ongoing balance between improving our productivity while innovating for long-term sustainability, specifically by improving the health outcomes of our members and simplifying their healthcare experience.","We believe we have a significant opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system. This is highlighted by a recently completed multi-years study conducted by Humana researchers and published in the journal of the American Medical Association. The study puts a spotlight on the nearly 25% of our country's annual total healthcare spending that can be deemed as waste.","That's one out of every four healthcare dollars or between $760.935 billion each year. Our integrated approach to holistic health through programs like Medicare Advantage, uniquely position us to evolve healthcare, driving affordability through improving clinical outcomes and simplifying the experience and reducing the waste in the system. As we look to 2020 and beyond, we are continuing to meaningfully advance our strategy which centers on improving health outcomes, through the most impactful areas of health, home, primary care, pharmacy, behavioral health and social determinants.","In addition, we are making it easier for our members to interact with us and others in the healthcare system through leveraging technology to develop a healthcare ecosystem. An important element of our strategy includes establishing partnerships with key organizations. Our multi-partnership approach allows us to minimize risk, move faster, and use our [indiscernible]","To that end, you'll recall last quarter I highlighted our partnership with Epic and today I'd like to share additional examples of recent partnerships. And our efforts to simplify the healthcare experience in our group and specialty business, we recently expanded our partnership with Accolade, first announced in March of this year. We've created a differentiated health engagement experience for individuals and their employers by integrating our organization's capabilities.","Together we will continue to create personalized and simplified member experiences and leverage new opportunities around solution flexibility, service delivery, partner integration, and economic value in healthcare. Our partnership, which includes their recent additional strategic investment, allows us to tailor the Humana and Accolade solution for a broader base of fully insured and ASO prospects and clients, including expansion of upstream larger group accounts.","At the core of our strategy is interoperability, which facilitates our relationship with our provider partners, while simplifying the experience of our members. Recently Humana Pharmacy developed what we believe is the first clinical decision support fire integration in production between a payer and a provider via their clinical workflow. Our partner Signifyd Health is now using our OneMedList in connection with an in-home assessments, giving them the ability to confirm in real time member adherence to their medication and more proactively identify potential adverse drug interventions and drug disease conflicts.","During 2020 we will roll this same functionality to all Kindred at Home and other health care \u2013 health home health providers including integration with the new home care \u2013 home based system. The integration of technology like OneMedList with Kindred at Home is enabled by Humana's integration with the home care, home-based electronic medical record and practice management system. The integration allows the prescription drug information gathered by the Kindred at Home nurse to become part of the Humana record, ensuring a more comprehensive record and reducing the likelihood of medication errors.","This will accelerate our ability to proactively identify key clinical interventions while improving revenue capture and business and quality reporting. Lastly, just a few weeks ago, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft, focused on building modern healthcare solutions for Humana members aimed at improving their health outcomes and making their healthcare experiences simpler to navigate. The main objectives of this partnership center on evolving our organization to cloud to improve our speed and efficiency, while assisting us in key initiatives such as the build out of our longitudinal record so that our members and their care teams have a complete view of their health records for real time interventions.","Importantly, our partnerships with Microsoft will help amplify our home health strategy through the use of their home devices, natural language processing and device data integration. Similarly, we continue to work closely with key partners like IBM, helping enable data interoperability across our ecosystem and voice-based self-service capabilities using Watson to better serve our providers.","These external partnerships compliment our internal resources and accelerate solutions we are developing for our members and providers that simplify their experience, enable proactive clinical interventions and advance value-based population health management. For example, in January, 2020 we are launching a new population health management platform, population insights compass, that makes it easy for primary care providers to manage the complexity of value-based payment models.","These tools meet a critical need of our providers and that it delivers a single solution for all payers. Compass will be a payer agnostic with interoperability and for various information systems, complimented with powerful analytics to identify providers that deliver the most effective care interventions.","Providers who will have access to multiple sources of data in one location including medical and pharmacy claims, financial data, serious opportunities, clinical programs and predictive models. The analytics and reporting capabilities will be deployed through a contemporary mobile experience based on the deep knowledge of Humana's successful management of population health over the last 30 years.","When it comes to leveraging the power of value-based care, Humana has continued to make progress for our MA members. For example, when comparing members in Humana MA value-based agreements to those and Humana MA for fee-for-service arrangements, we've seen 9% more eye exams for individuals with diabetes and 21% increase in blood sugar control management. A testament to Humana's experience in this the combination of the 60% of providers being in a surplus and are increasing number of MA members enforced our plans are greater.","HumanaOne avail an additional value-based care results in our Sixth Annual Medicare Advantage value-based care report on Thursday morning, November 21. These partnerships and investments among others are designed to continue to improve quality in customer service for our members and providers. Our orientation to these two pivotal aspects of healthcare resulted in recognition from multiple external stakeholders.","In addition to the awards we shared last quarter, including receiving the JD Power award for the number one mail order pharmacy. We recently ranked as the health insurer brand, most recommended by customers in Forrester's 2019 US Customer Experience Index. And received a number one Net Promoter Score ranking by Verint ForeSee in their Verint Digital Experience Index 2019 Insurance Edition which recognizes the most loyalty, inspiring digital experience in health insurance.","Our commitment to patient focused pharmacy benefits also earned us the specialty pharmacy patient choice award in the PBM payer specialty pharmacy category. This is the second year in a row that MMIT and Zitter Insights have presented Humana with this award. Further and more importantly, our commitment to quality and service as demonstrated by our compelling operational execution leading to strong star ratings and significant improvement in our CMS program audit results.","We are pleased that 3.7 million of our existing a Medicare Advantage members representing approximately 92% of our total MA membership are in four star and above contracts for 2021 bonus year, including 1.3 million members in four and a half star contracts and five-star contract in the important state of Florida.","In addition, CMS completes a comprehensive program audits every three years and we saw significant improvement in our results for our recently completed 2018 audit as compared to our 2015 audit. These results are a testament to the strong capabilities we've built through our Medicare Advantage platform, especially in our analytics, enterprise wide operating structure, talent development and management information systems.","Turning now to 2020, we believe we are competitively positioned in Medicare Advantage based on our early indicators from the annual election period. However, as previously indicated, the likely return of the health insurance industry fee or HIF in 2020 is particularly challenging. We began preparing for the return of the HIF last year, working diligently to identify ways to improve our cost structure by leveraging technology to streamline processes.","These efforts have also included this continuing work being performed that no longer aligned to our strategy to create capacity for activities that drive the most value to our members and advance the company's long-term sustainability.","As a result, we've had to make some tough decisions in recently announced the 2% reduction in our workforce. As a result of initiating our productivity planning over 12 months ago, we've been able to minimize the number of impacted team members by redeploying where and when appropriate, many of these individuals to other positions. Approximately 2,000 jobs were impacted by these combined changes. Despite these productivity efforts, there are still members who will see an increase in premium or reduction in benefits next year, given the magnitude of the HIF.","Given that the HIF is a premium based fee beneficiary \u2013 base fee beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, the sicker and most vulnerable populations are disproportionately taxed. As we've mentioned before, there is a bipartisan support to further suspend the HIF. Given the significant positive benefit, the removal the fee would have \u2013 we continue to urge Congress to address the HIF.","We continue to expand our Medicare offerings and segment our products to align to the unique needs of certain populations. For example, we are expanding our Dual Special Needs Plan offerings and launched Humana Honor Medicare Advantage plans. In the Honor plan, which is available to any \u2013 excuse me, which are available to anyone eligible for Medicare, but are designed in a way that compliment the benefits of a veteran receives through VA Healthcare, underscoring our commitment to veterans.","We are also expanding our supplement benefit offerings and introduced offerings under the CMS Value-Based Insurance Design or VBID and Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill or SSBCI programs. Our VBID offerings include healthy food cards, Part D rewards, COBD adherence and wellness and health planning. SSBCI is a tailored benefit to address gaps in care and improve specific health outcomes that we are piloting into market.","As I said previously, while it is early based on the results to-date in the AEP, we believe we are competitively positioned in Medicare advantage as expected at the time of bids. Our brand resonates with seniors giving our focus on customer service and quality, our strong clinical programs and provider relationships, as well as our longevity in the MA market. We also believe, we are competitively positioned in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans or PDP. We introduced a new line-up PDP offerings for 2020, designed to provide a wide range of options to meet the varying needs of people with Medicare.","Following two years of significant PDB membership losses, recognizing that historically individual plan selections have been driven by price alone, it was important for us to redesign our products for 2020 in order to address the needs of our members, while offering a competitive low price plan. We also recognized that these changes had to be made under CMS\u2019s regulation, which limits us to three PDP plans per region. Accordingly, we launched a new low price plan co-branded with Walmart, the Humana Walmart Value Rx plan. We are pleased that the national monthly plan premium of $13.20 is the lowest available in the most markets.","The 2019 Humana enhanced Rx and the 2019 Humana Walmart Rx prescription drug plans were combined to create the 2020 Humana Premier Rx plan. This plan is designed to include our most robust coverage for 2020. Members from the previous plan are now enrolled in the new Premier Rx plan. This change affects approximately 2.6 million customers. We recognized consumers have varying healthcare needs, so we are anticipating a certain level of member \u2013 movement between our premier plan and our new low premium Walmart plan.","We have empathy for our customers who are experiencing changes to their plans. We've been reaching out to them proactively to find the best plan for their budget and healthcare needs. Lastly, we continue to offer basic plan designed to keep premiums and benefits stable. These changes are required for positioning us for the long-term growth, but create short-term on certainty and PDP membership expectations for 2020.","Brian will provide more detailed 2020 commentary in his remarks, including high level EPS and membership guidance. In closing, we are confident that the measures we've taken in 2019, combined with our relentless focus on the activities that drive the most value to our members and advance the company's long-term sustainability will allow us to continue to operate from a position of strength. That means, meeting the commitments we've made including to positively impact the health outcomes of our members, to consistently deliver growth for our shareholders and continue to create an environment, where our team members can do their best work on behalf of those we serve.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Kane","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning everyone. Today we reported adjusted EPS of $5.03 for the third quarter, exceeding our previous expectations and raised our full year of 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $17.75 from approximately $17.60. The increase in the quarter, primarily was driven by continued outperformance in our retail segment. The improvement in our results throughout the year has afford us the opportunity to make important incremental investments across all of our businesses, that we expect to help position the company for a solid 2020, a year in which we are facing a meaningful headwind from the scheduled return of the health insurance industry fee.","In addition, we are pleased that our strong 2019 financial results together with significant individual Medicare advantage membership growth and improving net promoter scores have resulted in increased incentive-based compensation for associates across all segments of the organization, aligning compensation to shareholder value and the member experience. As a result of this higher investment spending in 2019 to benefit 2020 and beyond and the increased incentive-based compensation relative to our prior guidance, we increased our full year 2019 consolidate operating cost ratio guidance by 15 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 11.3% to 11.6%.","I would note that a number of the incremental investments we are making will occur in the fourth quarter and include among other items, higher Medicare annual election period marketing spend and increased sales and service costs, associated with the PDP plan changes, Bruce discussed in his remarks.","I will now briefly discuss our segment results for the quarter. In our Retail segment, our individual and group Medicare advantage businesses continued to perform exceptionally well with higher than anticipated membership growth and lower than previously expected utilization. As a consequence, we increased our individual MA membership growth to approximately 530,000 members versus the prior range of 480,000 to 500,000, and decreased our full year Retail segment benefit ratio by 30 basis points from the prior range at the midpoint.","Additionally, our pretax income for the segment is increasing $100 million at the midpoint. Our Healthcare Services segment also continues to perform well, and it's delivering strong results as expected. All of our businesses in this segment including Pharmacy, Clinical, Provider and Kindred are having a very solid year. In our Group and Specialty segment, various factors, mostly one-time in nature resulted in a higher benefit ratio than previously expected.","I would note however, that core trend remains as expected and in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Investments include, dental platform enhancement, the position is very attractive business for future growth, this required a significant IT upgrade and network revisions, including recontracting and rate adjustments resulting in payments to providers. We are also making other enhancements to make our commercial infrastructure more robust and scalable to move up market, including investments in local teams in key markets and the medical network that is more attractive to larger groups to capitalize on our new partnerships and the innovation we are looking to drive.","The higher benefit ratio along with increased compensation from the enterprise incentive-based program resulted in $100 million decline in our full year pretax income guidance from our previous midpoint to a range of $125 million to $175 million. From a capital deployment and cash flow perspective, you will recall that we entered into $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement last quarter. It is important to note that under the ASR, we paid the entire $1 billion upon entering into the agreement and received 80% of the shares based on the average share price on that date.","We expect the ASR to complete in the fourth quarter at which time we will settle it based on the volume weighted average price at which the stock was ultimately purchased over the term of the ASR less than negotiated discount. Additionally, we now expect operating cash flows of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion for the full year. The increase of $1 billion from our previous guidance primarily reflects higher earnings, continued top line outperformance driven by significant MA membership growth, which has exceeded expectations and other working capital changes.","With that, I will now discuss our high level expectations for 2020 membership revenue and earnings per share. We believe that the strong results in 2019, which we were able to reinvest in 2020 product design, along with the strategic investments we have made and meaningful productivity initiatives that we have pursued have set us up to weather the headwinds we are facing and provide investors with a solid 2020 outlook.","As it relates to the productivity initiatives, we began working on these well over a year ago to prepare for the scheduled hit return. And the entire company rallied to not only reduce costs, but also to drive longer-term sustainability and a simplified experience for our members across all of our major processes. We looked horizontally across silos to identify efficiencies, leveraging automation wherever possible. We removed management layers that were keeping us further from our customer, we created efficiencies in our local markets to ensure that every customer touch point was adding value, we rationalized our real estate portfolio and we streamlined our corporate structure, eliminating non-value-added work from our centralized functions.","We did all of this to free up capacity, not only to minimize the disruption to our members and our shareholders from the scheduled return or the HIF, but also, so we could continue to invest in technology and new clinical models to drive quality and an improved and simplified experience for our members, distribution partners and providers. Ultimately we had to make very difficult decisions. And as Bruce discussed, we reduced our workforce by around 2% taking a onetime charge of approximately $46 million. Importantly, we were able to minimize the number of associates impacted by these efforts by meaningfully reducing hiring over the past year, evaluating the necessity of open roles and where possible transitioning individuals to strategically aligned open positions from roles that no longer support our strategy.","All-in, these workforce initiatives effected approximately 2000 positions. Notwithstanding these significant efforts, the scheduled return of the HIF forced us to reduce benefits for some of our members. We were prudent and thoughtful in our approach and based on what we're seeing early in the ongoing annual election period, we expect to grow our individual MA membership by 270,000 to 330,000 members in 2020. This represents growth of approximately 7.5% to 9.2% with the low end representing our view of 2020 individual MA membership growth for the industry.","The number we are providing today could change materially depending on how sales develop and where voluntary terminations ultimately come in. As is typical, we have very little member termination data at this point in the AEP cycle. With respect to group Medicare advantage, as we have previously stated, growth can vary widely from year-to-year based on the pipeline of opportunities, particularly large accounts going out to bid.","While we had solid growth in 2019, we expect more robust growth in 2020 of approximately 90,000 members, an increase of 18%. This includes a large contract win from a competitor. Regarding PDP, the repositioning of the product for 2020 has affected approximately 60% or 2.6 million of 4.4 million PDP members. We proceeded with the important principle, that it is critical to have a low premium product in the marketplace to attract a balanced risk pool. We are also committed to returning to growth in this business. Well, the actions we took were necessary to drive long-term sustainability and provide a growth path going forward following two years of significant PDP membership losses, these changes are resulting in more uncertainty around our membership expectations for the PDP business in 2020.","Based on what we've experienced in the annual election period to-date, we expect a net decline in PDB membership of at least a few 100,000 in 2020. We expect to grow nicely in the new low priced Humana Walmart Value Rx plan, but we are seeing high plan-to-plan changes and terminations associated with the Premier Rx plan. However, we will caution that we are still early in the AEP and the open enrollment period from January to March adds additional uncertainty, given the potential member disruption from these changes.","With respect to Medicaid, excluding the Louisiana contract win, as we await the results of the protest and member allocations among the winning plans, we anticipate 2020 membership growth of approximately 150,000 to 200,000 lives. This increase primarily reflects the impact of discontinuing our reinsurance agreement with CareSource and assuming full financial risk for our existing Kentucky Medicaid contract as of 1.1. We are currently awaiting the results of the Kentucky contract rebid which we expect in relatively short order.","Finally, in our Group and Specialty segment, we expect total group commercial medical membership losses in the range of 80,000 to 100,000 members. This reflects robust membership growth in our small group level-funded ASO products which will be more than offset by continued pressure in our community rated and large group fully insured box, as well as our large account ASO product, due to the competitive pricing environment.","I will now briefly turn to our 2020 expected financial performance. With respect to the top line, we anticipate our revenue growth percentage to once again be in the double-digits, primarily reflecting solid Medicare Advantage membership growth and per member per month premium increases. From an earnings perspective, we believe we have struck the appropriate balance between membership and earnings growth in light of the significant headwind that the HIF creates, and we continue to expect reasonable growth and earnings per share off of our initial $17.25, 2019 guidance midpoint, below our long-term target of 11% to 15%.","More specifically, we anticipate that the current Wall Street consensus estimate for 2020 EPS will fall within the initial EPS guidance range that we provide on the fourth quarter call, albeit, we expect this consensus number to approach the top end of the range that we will provide. We look forward to providing more specifics on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.","With that, we will open the lines up for your questions and fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Great, thanks. And thanks for all the color on the guidance side of things. So obviously hefty top line growth. You mentioned some of the margin pressure obviously or continued margin pressure largely from sort of HIF. So, if you can balance out sort of how you're thinking about kind of margin and the margin ramp, as we think about not just 2020, but then into 2021 as well. Just directional commentary there, I know you don't want to give too much specifics.","And then, just more specifically around this year on the population base that you've captured kind of within individual. And anything you can call out that makes the initial margins may be a little bit better than usual or processes that you've put in place that help sort of better manage the margin earlier to give you sort of maybe some runway as we think about 2020 and potentially better margin as we move through the year? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Good morning, Ralph, it's Brian. With regard to the individual MA margin, we're not prepared to give specifics today. I would tell you that for 2019, obviously as we continue to raise guidance, we are getting closer to our margin target, but we are still below it. I'll remind you that we've taken some of this outperformance and reinvested that in a benefit design for 2020, so that will obviously adversely impact the margin, but yes, we also need to grow pretax.","And so, I would tell you that our margin for 2020 will continue to be below our long-term target, albeit, we continue to make progress against that goal. Beyond that, as we've committed is to getting back to that 4.5% to 5% margin target, obviously not prepared to give specifics on beyond 2020 today, but it's a focus of the organization to do that while we balance membership growth, because ultimately what we want to achieve is our 11% to 15% EPS growth target.","With respect to new members, what I would say is that we've been pleased with how new members are running. As you know, we typically priced them to breakeven in the first year, as it takes several years for them to be documented appropriately and get into our clinical programs to ultimately drive margin from those members. I would tell you that our new members are running a little bit better than expectations as we approach the fourth quarter here. So that's obviously good news.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. Thanks for all the color.","Amy Smith","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Windley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm also focused on Medicare advantage and enrollment growth this year, I think you've raised now 5 times and growth is about double where your original expectations were. So kind of a follow-up to Ralph. One, have you done anything differently from a selling standpoint, either broker channel or anything like that, that has driven the intra-year growth higher than you normally experience?","And then secondly, Brian, on the answer you just gave, Ralph, is the upside to margin this year more attributable to new membership doing better or is it more the base doing better? Thanks.","Brian Kane","I'll just start with the second question. I would say it's more of the base. I would just tell you that the new members are running a little bit better than expectations, but our core, what we call concurrent members are running really exceptionally well, which is what's driving the outperformance. As it relates to membership guidance, this is obviously a difficult number to predict because you're trying to understand what competitors have done, what the broker channel is doing. And what we've seen this year really are several things. First off in the optional election period or open enrollment period, effectively members have a one-time option to change plans early in the year that was something new this year.","And we outgrew our expectations there really as a consequence of the fact that our benefit design and our \u2013 I think our broker relationships were really positive. And so that was one of the lifts that we got. Obviously, coming out of the AEP, it's always unpredictable, where you\u2019ll ultimately finished because there's so little data when we first give guidance, but I\u2019d say the first upside was around the OEP.","And I would just say throughout the year, we've been pleasantly surprised about how our membership has been resonating with \u2013 and our benefit design has been resonating with new potential members, again, the broker channel is really outperforming, I would say they\u2019re the channel that's producing most of the outperformance currently. And that's just a function of, I think, the relationship that we develop, the tools that we provide them and the brand in the marketplace that we've been able to establish because of the really service we provide and the provider relationships that we've had. And so, we've just seen continued resonance in the marketplace that had been above our expectations.","David Windley","Great. Thank you.","Bruce Broussard","Just to add, I think, we also had expanded our Special Needs Plans and the ability to market them all year long has also been contributed to the over performance. I think we continue to see us being strong in that marketplace both in the current year and in subsequent years.","David Windley","Great. Thank you.","Amy Smith","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Thanks for that discussion about the HIF for next year and its impact, hopefully somebody hears that. From \u2013 my question now is looking at your guidance for 2020 at consensus of 18.75 for next year, that's sort of 8.5% growth, which sort of matches what you talked about before early in the year about the growth you expected for 2020. Having said that, your performance this year has pretty dramatically outperformed where you originally thought you would be and your growth has been faster. Can you tell us, has that number come up in your mind over \u2013 since you first discussed the reasonable or good growth for next year or has that number stayed about the same? And if it has stayed about the same, why has it not gone higher?","Brian Kane","Okay. It's a fair question. I really wouldn't \u2013 I prefer not to give all the specific play-by-play as to how our guidance points ultimately developed. Obviously, there are lot of factors that go into our guidance. On the outperformance that we've seen this year has been positive with respect to that. We incorporated a lot of that outperformance into our benefit design, which was really important, we talked about that the last quarter. Obviously, the more you outperform, you feel better about the guidance that you're given, but beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment. We feel good about the guidance, the number that we're given today and we'll provide more details on the fourth quarter call.","Peter Costa","If I could, just a follow-up. Is there a concern about the group business being underperforming and that's holding you back or is it a concern about the Part D business, although, that's \u2013 you're talking about that down only a couple 100,000 lives, which seems really good given the price increases so many of those members are facing.","Brian Kane","Yes. Look, we are still ways away from understanding the membership that we've attracted, in AEP, we're just starting the process, PDP matters too, just in terms of the member movement and who moves and how that occurs. And so there's always lots of uncertainty at this time of year in providing guidance, which why we hesitatingly do so. But I know it's important for our investors that we do. And so we try to give you a broad context of how we're seeing things. And I would just say there's lots of uncertainty at this point in the year. And I think the guidance we've given is appropriate and reflects our current best thinking.","Peter Costa","Thank you very much.","Amy Smith","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask about, let me switch over to Medicaid here, obviously the wind in Louisiana is positive, but you didn't get anything necessarily in Texas for the star plus program. Just a question is that, have you seen the scoring yet? And to give you a sense of sort of where you think you might have missed out here? Is there something that you might want to consider appealing for?","And then more broadly with some of the RFP opportunities coming up like in Pennsylvania at the end of the year and possibly Ohio as well. How are you thinking about your organic efforts to grow the business going forward?","Bruce Broussard","Let me take that question. Obviously, we're very excited about the Louisiana opportunity coming in second and really the top four profit organization in the scores, which I think also supports how we did in Florida. And what we see is, in the states that are looking for a progressive view on Medicaid and looking for a comprehensive program that really isn't taking some of the historical programs and carrying them forward, but really dealing with things like social determinants, doing things in areas of value-based payment models, using predictive models to allow much more clinical interaction. We've seen that\u2019s being a very responsive to our capabilities.","I think Texas, we continue to be engaged in Texas, we're not going to comment on how we approach the \u2013 both this current award and then in addition the award that will be coming out in subsequent months. But we do believe that Texas probably erred a little bit on the area of staying a little bit true to what has been the traditional players as opposed to looking a little broader in market and where other states have gone and being a little more oriented to some of the programs that we offer.","That being said, we continue to be very oriented to market that are complementary to our Medicare platform as \u2013 and you'll see us participate in other states that where we have a good position in the marketplace, both in our relationships with providers around value-based capability where we have social programs to help support the communities that we have there, and in addition, where we have strong relationships with the states. So you'll see us respond to RFPs, I don't think we're giving out where we're responding to, but I think if you look at the overlap of where we have deep capabilities and with our MA, that will give you guys some insight of what we \u2013 where we would prioritize our states at.","Charles Rhyee","Thanks. Just to clarify, in Kentucky, there was no actual official date that the state ever notified that they would make a decision by, is it just sort of that we've been expecting a decision around this time?","Bruce Broussard","That's correct. We expect a decision relatively short order on that.","Charles Rhyee","Okay, great. Thank you.","Amy Smith","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I appreciate the fact that throughout the year you guys have outperformed and reinvested some of the outperformance into the bids for 2020. But we're getting later into the year, and so the MA outperformance in Q3 feels like it's probably difficult to say that that's been kind of built-back into the bid. So just trying to think about how that flows through into your thinking about next year\u2019s margin targets? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Sure. Good morning, Kevin. I think that's fair. I mean, look, we've outperformed in the third quarter that obviously does flow through to next year, we're mindful of that, and it's incorporated in the 2020 perspective that we've given today. But you're correct, I mean, obviously the better the Medicare business performs in the back half of the year, the better we're set up for a stronger 2020.","Amy Smith","Thanks, Kevin. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is open.","Scott Fidel","Hey, thanks. Want to ask just about the group and specialty business and sort of thinking about this, I guess over the next sort of multi-year framework. So if you look at the updated revenue and segment profit guidance, it implies only a little bit more than a 3% pretax margin for 2019, obviously, I know there is some investments in there, but also some of these mixed shifts. Maybe talk about, what you think the longer-term sort of margin range for that business conceptually should be? And if the margins stayed at these levels, it's called a 3% or so, a little bit North of that.","How do you think about sort of returns in this business in terms of the risk-based capital and the resources that you provide into this as compared to sort of other options that you would have for deploying still meaningful capital that you have for the group business. Thanks.","Brian Kane","Yes. Good morning, Scott. We haven't given specific margin guidance targets for the commercial business. What I would say is though that we are committed to growing it and really appealing to an employer base that is really crying out for a different offering. And we believe, we\u2019ve the opportunity to leverage our clinical chassis from our retail business. Some of the partnerships that Bruce outlined, some of the innovative D&A that we have within Humana to \u2013 we believe offer a product that is compelling to the group space.","We view this space as having a lot of optionality, it's something that we want to continue to invest in and something we will invest in. As you indicated, we have invested this year, you'll continue to see us invest in it. The margins on the specialty product being the dental and vision product are very attractive and so it's important to get that right.","So we set ourselves up for a strong growth path over the coming years. And I would say also we have an opportunity to leverage really the pipeline that group provides into the retail segment for the \u2013 going from under 65 over 65 both for our individual business, as well as for our group MA business. And I think, that's something we haven't really capitalized as much as we can do and you'll see us continue to focus there. And so, as Bruce mentioned in his remarks, we're continuing to look up market.","So we're very focused on the small group customer and it's something we've done quite well, particularly on the ASO level funded side and the traditional underwritten product, where we've done quite well. But we think there's the opportunity to move a little bit up market, really build out key markets, where some of the infrastructure hasn't been as geared to some of these larger account customers. And I think offer an innovative product, it's going to take several years, but we're committed to that. And I think also you'll see because of a number of more one-time investments this year, you'll see an increase in pretax for next year, I mean for 2020.","Bruce Broussard","As Brian has highlighted, we realized that we need to improve the group performance and we look at it in a few different ways. First, I think you'll continue to see us focus on how can we improve the productivity of the business and do it in a way that has long-term sustainability, that\u2019s one. I think, second is that you\u2019re going to see us orient to markets that we feel are complimentary to Medicare and be much more oriented to what markets we're in, as opposed to being in a number of different markets. We find our products are more regional based, they are \u2013 they serve a customer base that has a large employment base that's in that region. So school districts would be a good example of that and municipalities and other governmental agencies that we serve.","The third thing I think you'll see is, is that we Accolade is a great example of that. That you'll \u2013 that will continue to focus on how we differentiate ourselves through experience and also health offerings, which is at the core of what our \u2013 the company is about, if you look at our Medicare success, our clinical capabilities, and in addition, our customer service sort of ranks as being best in breed, I think you'll see us continue to do that.","So, we realize this year's performance in group is not something that we're proud of. We are very active to both improving it in the short run, but as Brian says that as I think under Chris Hunter's leadership that we are very oriented to improving the business in a way that compliments the existing platforms that we have and both markets and in specific capabilities.","Amy Smith","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. We got the final home health rates with a little over 4% behavioral assumption baked in. And some of your peers have cite not insignificant margin pressure for 2020. How do you think about this rate structure impacting Humana's comp health margins? Is it impactful at all to the 2020 guide that you alluded to? Is it a headwind we should consider there? And I realized that there's a big strategic importance of home health beyond the unit itself, but was wondering if this impacts at all your vision for growing or potentially exercising the call option in the future? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","I'll take it. I think there's multiple layers of points to the reimbursement and let me sort of talk a little bigger picture and then we'll get down to the specifics of the 8% versus 4% behavioral adjustment. I think in general, when we went into the Kindred investment, we went into it with the view that there would be reimbursement changes in there and those reimbursement changes would not only be rate impacted, but also just the way the business was going to the drivers of the business. And we are very excited about the changes of the reimbursement model, moving to a model that is going to reward more for nursing and reward more for chronic conditions as opposed to just therapy and be more oriented to less chronic conditions.","So first just the structural changes there we find are very helpful for our member base and then advancing the downstream costs, such as admissions and readmissions in addition complications of particular conditions in total. The second thing is when we constructed the deal and did our forecast, we constructed the deal with knowing that there would be a transition both \u2013 that would require operational transition, and in addition, require us from a financial point of view. And so, when we did the deal on it and based on our valuations, we also assumed this particular transition there.","That is one of the reasons why you saw the organization invest in technology in 2019 to be able to prepare for these changes. And I think, if you were sitting in the board room of Kindred, you would also see a number of other changes both from competencies, clinical programs and so on and preparing for it. So I think \u2013 the both Kindred and Humana are very active in that evolution.","The third thing is on the just the financial side and I would say that it is incorporated in our outlook for 2020 and the years beyond that. But I do also want to highlight that in, when we were to exercise the put or call it is on the operating performance post that reimbursement change. So it does reflect in the other 60% that we purchased on. So, in summary, we're very excited about the changes as it structurally changes the economics to take on the conditions that we feel are most important for our members.","Secondarily, we have incorporated that in the transaction, both in the operating results that we see over the coming years. But then most importantly, as our \u2013 as we move to exercise in the put or call is, it will be reflected in the purchase price accordingly.","Sarah James","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Amy Smith","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question around retail partnerships and specifically with Walmart. And just as you guys went through the big changes in PDP this year and got to learn a little bit more about the retail side of things, maybe any lessons learned about the importance of having local sort of community based care? And then sort of as an aside with bigger growth in the low cost product and some bigger declines in Premier. Are there differences in profitability by product in PDP?","Bruce Broussard","I\u2019ll take the first part, and I\u2019ll let Brian take the second part. In our relationships with retailers, we feel the combination of local convenience of both the pharmacy itself, but also the pharmacist is a very important part of the delivery both in Part D and also MA in total because we find the pharmacist is an important conversation to have not only about the drug but also about just conditions in general and so we \u2013 our relationships, whether it's a Walmart or Walgreens or other drug stores are very important for that and the delivery of that.","We've had a long standing and a very positive relationship with Walmart over the years and their drive of being low cost in the marketplace and our preference to be low cost in the marketplace is sort of an important synergy that we drive towards. And we feel that it continues to be that going forward.","This year is obviously an exceptional year for us in the conversion as a result of moving \u2013 having to combine two plans to create capacity for our low cost plan and the confusion that takes, but Walmart was very excited about our opportunity to bring a low cost plan out to be the leader in the low cost plan, which really sets what their \u2013 one of their missions is in both locally and nationally.","I'll turn it over now to Brian, maybe talk a little bit about the profitability between the different products.","Brian Kane","Without providing too much color because we typically don't give a lot of detail on individual products. Obviously the premium being much lower in the low price Walmart plan, the dollar margins going to be less per unit sold.","The question then becomes what is the impact on the healthcare services side and we'll see what the mail order uptick rate is, that'll be an important element of the profitability. And so obviously as we went into this year and we set guidance we're aware of those dynamics as they're shifting between the plans and some of that questioned around how many people migrate from one plan to the other obviously is an important assumption in our ultimate guidance range that we gave to that.","Josh Raskin","Thanks guys.","Amy Smith","Thanks, Josh. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess results year-to-date, some of the commentary as well would suggests the new members this year seem to be some of more profitable than, than you typically see in the first year. And so I, I guess, I have two questions in the back of that. First is, is there any reason to think that the ramp up in underwriting margins in 2020 would be less helpful than in the typical year, perhaps you could comment on what you assumed in your initial view on that front?","And then second, is it reasonable to view the uptick in DCPs kind of despite favorable commentary on cost trend, solid MBRs reported year-to-date as maybe a bit of a hedge against the risk of adverse selection or just higher MLR into next, year just given how fast you guys have grown the business.","Bruce Broussard","And with respect to 2020 new members, again, I just tried to provide commentary that the new members are running well. And so one of the biggest concerns you have when you particularly go 530,000 members that you could get adversely selected and you'd have problems there. What the message we're communicating today is actually that the members are running well.","We're not going to make any change in our assumptions. We always assume the members are breakeven because again, these are largely on the margin, but we want to make sure that that we appropriately reflect the fact that our experience has been that these new members are break even, so that'll be the assumption \u2013 certainly the assumption in our guidance today.","With respect to DCPs, I wouldn't read too much into DCPs. We feel that we are properly reserved this statistic can vary meaningfully quarter-to-quarter. If you look back over time, it varies several days not uncommonly from quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year, whatever that may be. I would just say, we feel good about how we're reserved and we think we'll reserve appropriately.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Hi everybody. I may have missed this. So I just want to ask this as a technical clarification and then ask you about the health care service division. Did you put a savings number on the productivity initiative you're rolling out, an annualized savings number that you hope to get at some point in the future from that. And then on the PBM, I guess we haven't asked you on this type of call in a while about your thinking there, any update on thought about investments there, whether you would look to potentially add capabilities?","You're also in a situation where there the other major PBMs are now aligned with a commercial insurer, does that give you any interest in potentially getting in the market, maybe helping other health plans or even smaller PBMs with some of the capabilities that you have expanding your reach?","Brian Kane","Yes. It's Brian, good morning A.J. So on the savings numbers, we haven't given a specific number in terms of what the 2020 savings are going to be, but they're, very meaningful. We mentioned that there are 2,000 positions that were really impacted by this and so that's a meaningful number and there were a number of non-sort of personnel related decisions that we've made that will result in significant savings.","I would just say also going forward, the intention is to continue the productivity initiatives into the future. We believe it's essential to be efficient with our resources not only to drive down costs, but also we believe it creates a better experience and outcome for our members and also frankly from a compliance perspective. So you'll see us continue to leverage automation in AI and other elements of looking really cross processes rather than within vertical silos.","Bruce Broussard","Just to add to what Brian's saying. A.J., I think you remember when the tax reform came out 24 months ago or so, we committed to our shareholders that we were going to invest in technology that would give us a longer-term savings. What you're seeing in 2019 that will show up in 2020 is the leveraging of that investment to come back and provide value to the shareholders. End of year that's needed considering the HIF and the need to continue to remain competitive in the marketplace. So I wanted to just go back in history to connect the dots there.","Brian Kane","On the PBM side, obviously this is a critical business for us. We're going to continue to invest, there's really several elements of it, there's traditional PBM side and how do we become best-in-class in sort of our claims processing and our formulary management in our IT capabilities, et cetera. And so we're very focused there on investing on that side of the business, there's then sort of traditional mail order pharmacy, both in terms of driving penetration as well as directly creating a much better customer experiences.","As Bruce has mentioned, we've been given awards on that front. We continue to invest in that and want to continue to lead the space there with regard to customer experience. We will look for opportunities to grow our specialty franchise. And so you'll see that as we look to grow that business. Obviously more and more of the pharmaceuticals fill today in the specialty space and that's something that we want to continue to grow. We want to figure out ways to grow our traditional mail order penetration, so you'll see us invest there.","And with regard to third-parties, we actually have a small third party business. We would be open to continuing to grow that, depending on the opportunity and so again, we're always looking for opportunistic opportunities out there to grow the business. And so I think we're thinking broadly about the PBM, it's a business that we want to continue to grow directly beyond just the MA and PDP membership growth in our retail segments, so we're very focused there.","Amy Smith","Thank you, gentleman.","A.J. Rice","Okay.","Amy Smith","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI, your line is open.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the dental re-contract and upgrade, can you just size how big of an impact that was? And is that wholly a one-quarter issue or is there a like a longer headwind as premiums catch up to the lower reimbursement rates in renewals over the next few quarters?","Brian Kane","That was definitely a number of one-time cost, I'd rather not quantify it, if it weren't meaningful, we wouldn't have called it out obviously, but I just \u2013 not give that level of granularity. I would say that this is going to be a several quarter investment in dental and getting us onto a growth path. We've actually done quite well in that business. We just think it's an opportunity to grow much faster, not only leveraging our individual MA growth, which we think is meaningful to cross sell in terms of what were called OSBs or Optional Supplementary Benefits that we can cross sell, but also on the group side as well.","So we continue to look to how to grow the group dental business. And so we want to ensure that we have platforms, systems and provider relationships that allow us to achieve that growth. And so we're going to continue to invest in it. I think you're going to start seeing a pay-off over time and as I said, we're committed to that.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Good morning. So focusing on the relationship with Walmart, obviously you had a long term relationship that\u2019s focused on the pharmacy and the pharmacist and Part D. Walmart recently launched their healthcare hub strategy in some markets. Do you see opportunities to expand the partnership with Walmart and crossover to the medical side as well?","Bruce Broussard","Yes, I mean, we always in discussions of how we can expand our partnership with Walmart that we find, as I mentioned on the previous question, that we find our culture and our goals are aligned, especially in the healthcare area. What we've found in their quest to expand their platform in healthcare within some place like Rome, Georgia, is that it is very catered to the commercial and their associate base as opposed to being more senior focused as what our products and services are.","So we are little more narrower in our approach. And so if you take our relationship with Walgreens in both in the Kansas city area and expanding into the South Carolina area, that is a senior oriented delivery model that is very much oriented around chronic conditions and value- based payment models. That's a different operating approach than Walmart is doing in some of their stores, but that's very commercial oriented and very fee-for-service oriented, low price in nature and I think they're really trying to help the healthcare system and bring in efficiencies to it.","But in a much different model, we're much more oriented to seniors, much more oriented to broader health conditions that we are managing over a longer period of time as opposed to maybe a little more volume and fee-for-service orientation.","Ricky Goldwasser","And then just one follow-up on the Medicaid side, obviously you're growing Medicaid nicely. When we think about future opportunities, are you open to pursuing an M&A to accelerate growth or are you primarily still focused on growing through a winning contract? Thank you.","Bruce Broussard","I think we look at it as a combination. We believe that our capabilities that we've built over the last number of years afford us the opportunity to interstate organically, which you've seen. But in addition we find that there are regional areas where we can expand in a quicker and more capital efficient way through acquisitions and we will be more than open to go that approach to.","Amy Smith","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Matt Borsch","Yes. Sorry if I missed this and you covered it, but on the fourth quarter earnings implied projection, it seems significantly conservative given how much you beat by this quarter. Is there anything else to read into it?","Bruce Broussard","Well, I would just say a number of investments are going to take place in the fourth quarter as they typically do. Really, reflecting the annual enrollment period and also the significant PDP sort of flux that we've seen, because of the number of members that are impacted by our changes. And so we were investing significantly just to ensure that transition goes as smoothly as possible. So I wouldn't read anything into it.","Matt Borsch","And just, if I could on the health insurer fee, as you look ahead to 2021, is there anything that gives you a reasonable hope in this basis? Sorry, at this point given it's an election year that we're going to try to get this done get, can you get another suspension?","Bruce Broussard","Yes., Matt. We would love to be able to speculate on this and give you the specifics on it. I think what we do believe is that there is a bipartisan support for this. I think if you were to talk to anybody, I would say it just doesn't make sense the way it's constructed at taxes, the underprivileged and it's just not appropriate.","I think the industry is wrestling with, not support it's wrestling with how does it get through the legislative process and all I don't want to say dysfunction, but the confusion that's in Washington right now, it's just hard to predict how this will get going through. There's some things, that they need to pass, there's some, how long do they pass it as it's sort of did they give a 30 day extension on certain things and get it through to January? Do they do six months? I mean there's just so many ways that this could get navigated through that.","We're just sort of sitting there and believing that it should be done. We believe that with their support, we're just trying to find the Avenue to do it and I think that's a little bit out of our control. We're influencing it as much as possible, but we are trying to find that right opportunity.","Matt Borsch","Okay. Thank you for taking that on.","Amy Smith","Yes. Thanks Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning Bruce and Brian. So you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks a new group membership contract win from a competitor for 2020 and guessing that new win is the Alabama Public Education Employees contract, unless there was a different large wind separate from Alabama, but either way, just on Alabama specifically, we calculated previously this contract alone could add up to a $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS for next year depending on the margin profile. Now you want to get down to discussing that level of granularity, but the question is, I guess I'm just wondering at a high-level, do you typically assume a decent level of profitability in margin in year one for new group contracts of this nature? Where does profitability get overwhelmed by onboarding costs in year one? Like it does an individual MA that you've talked about historically? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Sure. Without commenting on the specifics of the actual contract, I think it's fair to say that in the initial year the profitability is significantly less and that profitability ramps up over the time of the contract. We bid to ensure that our contribution margin positive, that's important for us to drive returns on capital, but there's definitely an improvement in those results over time, largely for similar reasons.","These members get in our clinical programs, which we find have a meaningful impact on their medical costs and their health and then also their conditions get documented more appropriately, so for the same reasons that impact individual MA results to similar dynamic in group.","Steve Valiquette","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Amy Smith","Thanks, Steve. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. You may ask your question.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. I just had a clarification and then a question, on the clarification, Brian, with respect to the 2020 EPS guidance. The last couple of years, you've given a range of $0.40 to $0.50 in the initial annual guide. Is there any reason why we should expect that range to be lighter this year?","Brian Kane","I think that's probably reasonable.","Gary Taylor","And then the real question I want to ask, I know this has been discussed a little bit. But just on the retail MA enrollment guidance for 2020, the 7.5% to 9.2%. You mentioned some benefit reductions in your plans. To us, it looked like your benefit reductions are more conservative than others that you're still guiding for above-market growth in your MA business. So is that optimism just purely the broker relationships, the marketing, the overall value-add that you think your plans represent in the marketplace? Or is there something more specifically, given we're almost halfway through open enrollment that is just perhaps trending better than you might have thought a couple of months ago?","Brian Kane","Well, I think it's a combination of things where we are still early in open enrollment in terms of the data, termination data is a really important element here and that's something that we just really don't have a lot of data on. It's very incomplete. I think you have a better view of sales, but still quite early in sales. A lot of the sales happen towards the end of the AEP period. So clearly our guidance is based in part on that, but also we evaluate on a market-by-market basis how we're positioned competitively. We have obviously all the plans that are out there, so we can see how we stack up versus others.","We do think that our relationships with the broker community are very important and our external channel and internal career force is very focused on driving growth. And so obviously that's a part of the calculation as well. And so, we'll see where it goes. I mean it's, it's very hard to predict that at this part \u2013 this part of the cycle, as Bruce said we did have to reduce benefits for certain of members. We were very thoughtful and prudent about that and that's entirely on account of the health insurance fee.","We've taken a balanced approach as we always do to growth into margin, but we think we've been bit baffled on how we've done that. So the guidance we put out today is really our best estimate of where we think we'll be and as we get further into the AEP period and obviously after we'll have more clarity around that.","Amy Smith","Thanks Gary. I believe this will be our last question. So next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. You guys have really scaled up your special need business presence this year. Would anything change your expectation on seeing growth in those Special Needs Plans next year? Just curious how you're thinking about the strategy around SNP plans in 2020 and then with 2021, around the corner and ESRD eligibility, just any update on conversations with CMS would be helpful. Thanks.","Brian Kane","So on the D-SNP side, as Bruce said earlier, we are committed to growing our D-SNP, you've seen significant increase in growth this year on the D-SNP side, we've expanded our D-SNP offering. I think you'll continue to see us expand our D-SNP offering. We believe that these members play right to Humana's strengths, which is managing difficult conditions and clinical challenges. And so it really is right in our strike zone. And so you'll see us continue to expand that.","We'll see where it goes with this year and obviously it's a competitive space but we're committed to growing it.","Bruce Broussard","On the ESRD, I mean we are very actively engaged with CMS on the details of that particular program, realizing that those members are both in great need of assistance and we see the Medicare Advantage program being able to slow the disease progression down for our members and at the same time finding cost effective treatment for their complex disease.","I would say that over the coming months, we'll probably see more details that come out of how that program will roll out all the way from \u2013 as they're going to be an adjustment in benchmark to things like network adequacy to areas of how some ESRD will evolve.","So there's a lot of \u2013 we believe there's a lot of changes that are needed in that we've communicated those changes to ensure that both those members and members that do not have ESRD would have adjustments made if the proper rates are not adjusted accordingly.","Bruce Broussard","With that, I think we'll call it that's it, right. And again, like every quarter we really appreciate both our shareholders support and in addition our analyst support in helping us communicate the story. In addition, we couldn't do this without the 50,000 associates that everyday get up and help our members and help us be successful like we have over the last number of years. So we appreciate everyone's support and have a wonderful day.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I will now turn the call over to Amy Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Amy Smith","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Chief Financial Officer will discuss our first quarter 2019 results and our updated financial outlook for 2019.","Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Our Chief Legal Officer, Joe Ventura, will also be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties . Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2019 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce Broussard","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.48 for the first quarter of 2019 and raised our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $17.25 to $17.50 primarily reflecting improved results in our retail segment.","We continue to expect strong industry leading individual Medicare Advantage membership growth, and today are raising our full year 2019 guidance to a range of 415,000 to 440,000 members, primarily reflecting improved rest of the year growth projections, as a result of solid performance in the open enrollment period that ended in March.","We take pride in the fact that we are leaders in Medicare Advantage. The fastest growing sector of healthcare as a result of the significant value that Medicare Advantage plans provide to over 22 million seniors across the nation. Seniors who participate in Medicare Advantage receive a higher level of benefits relative to fee-for-service with a cap on the total amount of expenses the member will incur in a given year.","At the same time the Medicare Advantage program drives quality, improved health outcomes, lowering the cost to the healthcare system by effectively managing the member's care, saving the system millions while helping seniors achieve their best health.","For example, Humana MA members and value-based care settings are going to the ER 7% less and hospital admissions are 5% lower than traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Our members are also getting 11% more colorectal cancer screenings and 10% more breast cancer screenings. As you know, under Medicare Advantage, members are able to participate in a variety of programs and services including in-home care coordination services.","Proactive care management programs such as remote monitoring, medication adherence and various supplemental benefits including dental and vision coverage. As a result of the payment model in MA, private organizations are motivated to treat seniors with more complex conditions and to go beyond traditional healthcare needs to address the whole health of an individual including social determinants of health, financial support and transportation.","Today approximately two-thirds of our individual Medicare Advantage members have access to physicians incentivized to spend more time with each patient. Take Betti as an example, Betti is a 78-year-old who lives with her disabled son and as primary caregiver. She likes to be independent and self-sufficient and wants to spend time with their grandchildren and great grandchildren, but is living with multiple chronic conditions including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD.","A stroke has left her with shoulder and sciatic pain. In addition, she struggles with depression and anxiety. We enrolled Betti in our Humana At Home Telephonic Chronic Care Management program and assigned a care manager to her.","To tackle Betti's fear of doctors develop an action plan for COPD. Educate Betti regarding monitoring her blood sugar, blood pressure, and weight and in the importance of regular primary care and specialist follow-ups. Finding transportation and eyeglass resources, applied for financial grants for medication. Signed Betti up for an in-home well being assessment and enroll her in Humana's mail-order pharmacy.","As a result of these actions, Betti experienced reduced financial strain significantly lowered her A1C, lost 15 pounds was able to get her blood pressure in the normal range and stop smoking after 60 years. She was so happy with her improved health outcomes and service.","She then recommended Humana to her sister and now she is a member. This is a example of one of many that demonstrates the effectiveness of our integrated care delivery model. The results experienced by Betti and millions of seniors are why Humana and Medicare Advantage continue to grow.","As we look ahead to 2020, we are pleased that CMS enabled plans to offer greater flexibility and benefits, so that we may continue to focus on the areas to improve the health of seniors and people with disabilities we serve. The final rate notice for 2020 reflects an increase of approximately 2.5% for the industry. We expect the impact on Humana to be slightly lower given small differences in various components.","In addition, for 2020, CMS has added Telemedicine as a covered benefit and we continue to work with them on broadening the scope of these services. Expanded the benefits that plans may offer to address social determinants of health, improved interoperability with blue button for MA, putting more data at members finger tips and in their control and added a demonstration program that narrows our risk via the corridors in Part D, a point-of-sale rebate regulations become effective after bids have been submitted.","With the increased likelihood of this policy change, we believe the implementation of drug rebates, at the point of sale in January 2020 creates certainty for both the industry and the members. In result, we stand ready to implement. In the interim, we recognized that we may still be exposed to manufacture actions in 2019. In addition while we appreciate the changes from CMS.","We would caution that all of the recent changes add more complexity to the bid process. Particularly, as it relates to how the various components of the Part D bids interrelate including premiums, formulary design and risk corridors.","As we navigate this transition, we believe that PBMs will continue to play an important role as an advocate for lower prices for members at the counter to both retailer and manufacturer negotiations. Perhaps more importantly robust clinical programs related to medication therapy management, drug adherence, and specialty drugs are essential to the PBMs ability to impact health outcomes.","In this respect, our clinical and pharmacy capabilities position us well to lower healthcare costs and improve member health. Despite these updates from CMS. The rate notice alone is not enough to overcome the formidable headwind from the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2020.","Estimated at $1.2 billion for us and is not tax deductible. While we will continue to work on designing new programs to improve health outcomes and lower cost as well as productivity initiatives, we do expect seniors nationwide to experience a decline in benefits and\/or increase in premiums in 2020 as a result of the return of the HIF.","Now I'll offer a few words on Medicare for all. Humana does not support any bill that would eliminate Medicare Advantage or make private insurance illegal and here's why. Insurance and Medicare Advantage created an incentive to have a holistic view of a member, which is critical to the long-term success of the program and the ability to offer greater benefits and more security for individuals.","MA is a program where the payment model motivates plans to engage with individuals with complex chronic conditions while driving quality improvement clinical outcomes resulting in lower cost and higher customer satisfaction. The success of this program is evidenced by the continued increase in MA penetration, the percent of Medicare eligibles enrolled in Medicare Advantage has grown from 22% to 34% in the last decade nearly doubling membership.","Looking ahead, the increasing number of Medicare beneficiaries participating in programs like Medicare Advantage coupled with the rapid advancement in technology only served to reinforce the strength of our integrated care platform.","Our investments in this platform are consumer-centric operating model and deeply integrated technology and analytics to enable personalized care and high-value services such as primary care, home, pharmacy, behavioral health, and social determinants of health will significantly improve health outcomes. The end goal of our strategy is to slow the rising cost of healthcare and enable expansion of coverage, while positioning the organization for growth and sustainability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.","Over the past 30 years, our company's commitment to improving the health of those we serve has meant working in private and public partnerships that transcend party lines, and we look forward to continuing that work.","With that I will turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Kane","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.48 for the first quarter. This exceeds our previous expectations primarily due to favorable utilization in our Medicare Advantage business. Consequently, we raised our full-year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $17.25 to $17.50 from our previous guidance of $17 to $17.50. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS to be in the low 30s relative to the full-year number on a percentage basis.","I also would like to echo Bruce's remarks that we are excited about our ability to guide to full-year expected adjusted EPS growth of 19% to 20% well in excess of our long-term growth target of 11% to 15%, while also delivering industry-leading individual Medicare Advantage membership growth. This reflects continued solid execution around our strategy of improving health outcomes and delivering significant value for our customers.","I will now turn to our segment results. In our retail segment, all lines of business are performing well. And as I've already mentioned, we are experiencing lower utilization relative to our initial expectations, particularly in our Medicare Advantage business.","In addition, we performed well during the open enrollment period or OEP for individual Medicare Advantage and are reaching our membership guidance range to an increase of 415,000 to 440,000 from our previous range of 375,000 to 400,000.","As a result of our first quarter outperformance, we've increased our retail segment revenue guidance by $200 million to a range of $55.1 billion to $55.7 billion and lowered our benefit ratio guidance for the segments by 20 basis points to a range of 86.4% to 87.4%.","We also raised our retail pre-tax guidance by $50 million at the midpoint. Turning to our Group and Specialty segment. Our level funded ASO product for small groups continues to gain traction in the marketplace as healthier groups migrate out of the community rated segment.","As a result of greater than expected ASO growth, we now expect net medical membership losses of 60,000 to 80,000, an improvement from our previous guidance of 80,000 to 100,000. This migration has resulted in a modest deterioration of our community rated block, which is reflected in a small amount of negative prior period development this quarter.","How this ultimately manifest in the 2018 risk adjustment settlement this June will be an important marker to understand how our book is developing relative to the broader market. As a result, we increased our segment benefit ratio guidance by approximately 30 basis points to a range of 81.3% to 81.8%. We continue to expect full year 2019 pre-tax earnings of approximately $300 million to $350 million for the Group and Specialty segment with core trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Lastly from a segment perspective. Healthcare services is performing in line with expectations and our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged for the full-year at $1 billion to $1.05 billion. Our Home business including both Kindred at Home and Humana at Home is outperforming our initial expectations, primarily reflecting higher than anticipated volume and increased deal synergies relative to expectations.","Similarly, results for our care delivery organization and Conviva are coming in slightly better than we previously anticipated driven by positive prior period development. Our Pharmacy business, however, is slightly behind relative to our initial expectations primarily due to overall lower network volume in the PBM as a result of better-than-expected utilization, which is a positive for the health plan and Humana overall.","Accordingly, we are lowering our full-year largely inter-segment revenue guidance to approximately $25.1 billion to $25.6 billion versus previous guidance of $25.95 billion to $26.25 billion. Briefly touching on operating costs, we increased our full-year operating cost ratio guidance by 10 basis points to a range of 10.7% to 11.5%. This primarily reflects accelerated investments in our integrated care delivery model to position us for 2020 and beyond contemplating the return of health insurance fee in 2020, which I'll discuss in a moment.","From a capital deployment perspective, in the first quarter, we completed our $750 million accelerated share repurchase program that began in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our full year guidance does not contemplate any additional share repurchase. With regard to sources of parent cash, we expect subsidiary dividends to the parent in 2019 to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion with payment expected both in the second and fourth quarters of this year.","Though disproportionately weighted to the second quarter similarly to 2018 subsidiary dividends that were paid to the parent. Additionally, the parent company receives the cash from the non-regulated earnings of our healthcare service segment immediately. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to deploy our capital.","Lastly, as we look to 2020, I would again echo Bruce's remarks in reference to the return of the health insurance fee, which as we have previously stated is approximately $1.2 billion with a $2.15 EPS impact from the non-deductibility of the fee for tax purposes.","While we continue to develop and execute trend vendors and meaningful productivity initiatives, these actions together with the final rate notice of just over 2% are not sufficient to overcome the health and medical cost trend without impacting member benefits and earnings growth.","In light of this and keeping in mind that 2020 bids have not yet been submitted, while we do expect to grow earnings per share reasonably in 2020 off of our original $17.25 baseline midpoint, it will be below our long-term target of 11% to 15%. I would remind you, however, that we have delivered adjusted EPS growth in excess of our long-term growth rate for each of the last four years.","This includes, as I've already mentioned, our expectation of adjusted EPS growth rate of 19% to 20% for 2019 together with individual MA membership growth of approximately 14%.","With that, we will open the lines of your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matt Borsch","Yes, thank you. Could you maybe step back and just give us your sense of where we are with Group Medicare Advantage. I know it's early in the year and I'm not expecting you to give a guidance point for 2020, but how is that market developing now, how much is it impacted by the HIF and do you see adoption accelerating there?","Brian Kane","Good morning, Matt, it's Brian. Our Group MA business continues to perform quite well. We are seeing similar trends in our Group MA business that we see in our Individual MA business. I would say the pipeline for 2020 looks good. There were fewer large jumbo accounts out there, but there are some sizable accounts that we're pursuing as well as our standard growth of small and mid-size accounts.","So, from that perspective, I think, we feel very good. The HIF and frankly rebates at point-of-sale due impact Group MA disproportionately relative to say Individual MA or PDP because the risk corridor proposal that there are ability that CMS has given us in terms of risk corridor protection does not apply to Group MA, and so we will see that goes into effect like we significant premium increases on the Group MA side. That being said, I think, people generally view the Group MA product as compelling. We see growth continuing there and we continue to play there pretty aggressively.","Matt Borsch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Maybe sticking with MA, you know, given sort of the benefit of investment this year and, obviously, the continued upwardly revised MA growth this year. Now that we also have the final rates. How should we think about the improvements as we think about 2020 MA margins and maybe sort of in line with sort of getting overall target margins here.","And then secondly maybe touch on the announcement you made the other day with a little bit more details around the partnership with Doctor On Demand. How do you see that fitting in? Is that sort of should we just think of it really as a another physician practice into your network that happens to be virtual or how do you see it being posed differently? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Sure. On the margin question. We continue to make good progress towards our target margins. As we said coming into 2019, we expected a reasonable margin improvement of our 2018 baseline. Obviously, today as we raised our retail pre-tax number, those margins continue to improve.","As we go into 2020, I would just say that in order to deliver EPS growth, as we said we would for 2020, you're going to have to increase your pre-tax profits, obviously, in excess of your after-tax just given the significant tax headwinds that we have.","So, that will require continued improvement in the margin profile of the business from a pre-tax perspective. But, overall, I think the business is tracking well. We have a very important principle of balancing that margin improvement with top line membership growth. We believe, we struct that balance appropriately in 2019. We'll continue to do that, we believe in 2020.","As it relates to Doctor On Demand that's really for our commercial business and we're excited about that partnership. I think we're in a position on the commercial side to disrupt the existing commercial infrastructure and commercial plans that are in place.","And I think this is just one example of our ability to do that and give our members additional choices as they look to choose their various health plans. And I would add that this Doctor On Demand is just in Florida, in Texas at this point, but we're excited about the partnership, and we'll see how it goes.","Charles Rhyee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte from SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.","Ana Gupte","Hey, thanks, good morning. My question is on the membership growth for Medicare that you raised your guidance based on first quarter. Can you talk about what percentage of your growth is coming from dual special needs plans and what the outlook is for the rest of the year? Then if you can just comment on your Medicaid strategy as it dovetails with the dual special needs in light of the Centene-WellCare announcement and the upcoming Texas contract awards?","Brian Kane","Sure. I'll take the DSNP question and then turn it to Bruce to talk about Medicaid. On the DSNP side as we pointed out in our release. We did see a nice increase in our DSNP annual enrollment period growth of call it 30,000 members versus only 1,400 last year, which obviously is a very significant increase.","I would say, we are bullish about our ability to continue that growth in the rest of your period where that's an opportunity unlike the more traditional Medicare with a few exceptions, you can enroll members. So, we are excited about our ability to do that. We expect that growth to continue. But if you look at our overall MA growth of 415,000 to 440,000, a majority of that is in the traditional Medicare space. But again we are seeing nice traction in our DSNP product.","Bruce Broussard","And Ana this is Bruce. A few things related to our Medicaid strategy. First, we are continuing to orient to how do we expand our DSNP presence both in adding additional regions that we offer DSNP plan, and then secondarily, how does our benefits are more competitive and you saw the share of adding the over-the-counter and some other aspects to our DSNP that has allowed this growth to happen.","Some at the Medicare Advantage side, we're very oriented to continue to expand our presence. The second area is in the Medicaid and the contractual area with states and as you all know in Florida, we had a wonderful growth. This year we grew 37% on a membership basis, as a result of our contract win last year, that contract is actually going quite well and our quality measurements and so on are aligned with what our expectations are and what the start expectations are.","We are participating in RFPs Louisiana and Texas are the two RFPs that we're participating in from an organic point of view, and we're very bullish about those RFPs as we are engaged at both the community level and the state level in that particular population.","You mentioned and asked about the WellCare, Centene transaction. We continue to be confident in our organic direction. We are always looking at the market and the M&A sign like no different than we have in the past and we continue to believe what our strategy is very, very exciting, and I think we'll be very competitive in the future.","Ana Gupte","Helpful color. Thanks, Brian and thank, Bruce.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. I wondered the 3.5% hospital inpatient rate proposal for 2020 came in a little bit higher than what we had expected and higher than recent history. And I think the spread of that rate and your 2.2% bump is a little bit wider than what we've seen. Can you just flush out and talk about the dynamics there and whether those payment rates directly tie or whether your payment rates directly tied to HIFs and how you offset that difference and\/or whether we should think about that as a headwind for 2020? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Good morning, Ralph. I won't comment a lot on that or going to say clearly is an input into our overall cost structure. There are many of our contracts are tied to Medicare and so there will be an impact there. That is something that we would have the price for it.","But what we've seen on the inpatient side is really a significant reduction year-over-year and admissions for thousand and obviously we're working very hard to ensure that continues. And so year-over-year, it's becoming less of a driver of our results. So, obviously still critical and a big component, but we are working to mitigate any unit cost increases through continued utilization transfers out of the hospital into more of an outpatient setting.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. This wasn't really the question I was going to ask, but I might as well because I know it's going to come up. When we talk about 2020, Brian, you had set a reasonable growth rate below the 11% to 15% long-term guidance. I think the rationale for that's reasonable and understandable. So the street currently is at 10% to 12% above your latest 2019 guidance.","So, can you help us triangulate a little more you -- is the reasonable rate below where the street is today, oftentimes you've commented, if you think the forward year is in a reasonable place or not. So just trying to get a little more precise on that?","Bruce Broussard","Yes, obviously, there's a wide range of estimates out on the street. We look at our growth relative to our $17.25 baseline because as we go towards the base for 2020. We typically price for what we call emerging experience, as we see emerging experience good or bad, we will put that into the pricing of our products. The good news is that we're seeing good emerging experience this year as I mentioned.","And what we just said was we would grow reasonably off that $17.25 baseline. We're not prepared to give any more guidance than that because we're giving frankly more color than we typically give. I know there's been a lot of questions around it. So, we're trying to help investors and analysts with that, but beyond that, we don't really want to comment further, it's still very early.","Gary Taylor","Okay, understood. Yes, I have to ask. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Steve Tanal","Thanks guys. I appreciate all the color. Just one follow-up on that, I mean, is it fair to sort of think about 2018 is maybe analogous to '20 just with the HIF returning. In '18, if we think about sort of 24% adjusted EPS growth seem like tax reform net of investments was sort of 17% ish, and so maybe reasonable then to sort of think about a 7% sort of net underlying growth in the year when the HIF came back and the other sort of variables here would be obviously much worse MA rate update that year than in '20 and slower growth in the prior year '17 then you'll have this year. So, that the market rate maybe better in '20. Is that a fair enough thought process or is there anything else you'd say to the sort of sway that one way or another?","Bruce Broussard","Look, I think, that is one way to look at it. I do think '18 is analogous to '20 other than, obviously, you said that the tax reform. HIF, as we continue to grow because we're growing MA, so rapidly becomes a bigger portion and therefore is a bigger tax deductibility impact there, our non-deductibility, but broadly as you thought about is not unreasonable but again, I think, we're still working through exactly how we're going to price our products, achieving that balance between sort of top line and bottom line, and so again beyond what we've said, which is a reasonable growth rate of the $17.25 is all we're prepared to say today.","Steve Tanal","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. First off, Brian, thank you for the 2020 commentary. I know that isn't typical and you must have -- really have to twist your arm to get you to say that. The question I had was on Part D with the HHS regs basically giving you some increased protection in terms of the corridor on margins. Everybody searching for Part D membership with synergies whether it's through a retail business or through a PBM.","Do you think there is a potential that you'll see more kind of aggressive pricing for 2020 with the thought process that you can grab some membership for a couple of years or do you think people can stay in the course and there is not a significant increase of membership volatility via pricing?","Brian Kane","Look, I would say, that there are a lot of variables that, as Bruce indicated, in his opening remarks. There are a lot of variables in the pricing this year that are creating additional uncertainty versus prior years. And I think people can handle that in different ways.","We're obviously thinking about our strategy and whether there are opportunities that we can pursue. It's really hard to say how people will price various things. We obviously are very supportive of CMS's notion of narrowing the risk corridors and giving more protection that provides really a support from a premium perspective and also allows plans to bid with more certainty.","So, that's obviously helpful, but this is one of those years where there is a lot of gain theory that I think everyone's going through, and it's not entirely clear what will come out of it. But I will tell you that we have internally here, a lot of smart people working on this, and thinking about different scenarios and I would just say we'll have more things to talk about after bids are submitted.","Justin Lake","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on that point there. I guess it wasn't clear to me exactly what your comments meant when you kind of said that, it felt like point-of-sale rebates are going to be increasingly likely for 2020 and that you are prepared to move in that direction.","Does that mean that if the rule comes out before the busy move in that direction. But if not you're going to big under current law or that you're looking to actually move the point-of-sale rebates kind of regardless of whether the reg comes down in time because it's just a matter of time before the industry moves in that direction?","Brian Kane","So, we're going to bid under current law because that's the instructions we've been given, but our expectation and we are supportive of rebates going point-of-sale for 2020 and we'll be ready for that. The CMS risk corridor program has provided the requisite protection, if rebates go point-of-sale for 2020.","So, industry participants can feel more confident about bidding sort of under the old rules, but the new rules happen, you're protected. And I think that's why we're supportive of both the CMS program and as Bruce said we want to get rid of the uncertainty. Let's just go there and get it done. We're ready to implement for 2020. We think bringing that certainty to the industry at least from our perspective will be a positive, so that's what we were indicating.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then just maybe clarify the corridors to your point earlier applied to certain parts of the MA and Part D businesses, but not Group MA and certain other components think of the bid that aren't included what percent of kind of the pricing is kind of insulated by that reg versus what you have to do to maintain margins, if you think about your book in total?","Brian Kane","Well, that's a really complicated question, I mean, to dodge it, but it depends on the various components of your existing book that you have in terms of how all the hydraulics work, and again I would distinguish individual MA from PDP from Group MA all the dynamics are different there , and it really depends on your membership mix.","The nature of the drug utilizing population that you have and then, as I said, in the Group MA side just quarters just don't apply. So, it really varies, and again we are doing all sorts of simulations and working through how various things may work out and we'll be prepared to bid and feel good about our bids when we submit in June.","Kevin Fischbeck","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is now open.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. Good morning. Question about the PDP, but more about sort of building of that business. In the past, I think, you've talked about some of the weakness this year and maybe relative to competitors around. Sort of a difference in retail strategy and assumptions etcetera.","I know you guys have talked about regional strategies and putting a couple of stores in Kansas City etcetera, but maybe just any progress I know we're only a month away now. So, bids are due, but are you thinking that you are sort of retail network of pharmacies going to look any different in 2020 and just updates there? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","We probably, I can't give you a lot of detail, as we are in the big process. I would tell you that we are looking at different strategies who reunite the Part D membership growth. As Brian articulated on a few questions. It is complicated because of the changes in the point-of-sale and the rebates and then all the hydraulics that comes from the risk corridor being inserted into that.","I would just probably leave it at this as the year progresses we'll be able to give you more details, but I do we as an organization are committed to trying to find that strategy that will reignite the Part D growth.","Josh Raskin","All right. I won't put words in your mouth, but it sounds like stuff in the works and we'll find out when we can. Is that fair?","Bruce Broussard","Yes, you're not going to put words in my mouth.","Josh Raskin","Thanks, Bruce.","Bruce Broussard","Thank you.","Amy Smith","Next question?","Operator","Next question is from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Dave Windley","Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. Just wanted to come back to the MA growth and I'm sure there has been a nice benefit from the improved broker relationships you guys have obviously talked about the investments there. I'm just curious how you think you are positioned versus your peers seems like you may have leapfrogged them in some regards. But can you talk about what is different to the extent that you can and how you feel about sustaining that advantage in 2020 and beyond as that contributes to outsized MA growth?","Bruce Broussard","Well, I'll start and then Brian can add. I would say that, it is market-by-market dependent. We think in some markets we are leading, but in most markets, we're in the competing with everybody else in a reasonable comparison between our premiums and medicine. So I wouldn't say that we're just highly differentiated in the marketplace.","I will tell you that one thing that we've seen this year is the retention is stronger. We've seen our broker sales be stronger in the markets where we have traditionally been strong market share wise and had really good relationships with providers that's also been a great add for us. So, I think, in general, it's a lot of different things, it's not just the benefits and premiums.","We see going into 2020 as being carrying that forward our strength with our brokers and the strength with the providers. Can't really speak about the benefit design as we are in that process now. But we, as Brian has said on many occasions both in calls and in investor meetings that we will be balanced and how we approach our benefits both in looking at margin expansion and at the same time being competitive in the marketplace as we like at our competition.","Dave Windley","Got it. Thanks.","Amy Smith","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. I guess I'll just continue on with the HIF discussion. Two aspects to it. One, you comment, you couldn't, you wouldn't be able to deliver the 11% to 15% if it comes back next year in terms of long-term growth. But I'm assuming there's nothing on an ongoing basis that would move you away from the 11% to 15%. It's just a one-year impact of that coming back and then you would assume that you can deliver that type of growth beyond that.","And second, I guess, I'd just ask, is there comments today a reflection of anything you're picking up and watching in terms of a willingness to address the HIF. I mean I guess it's pretty obvious they're not going to get it done, anything done before the bids are due, and your commentary and others had been that if it got done, it would probably be something like the debt ceiling, which now looks like it's going to be addressed later in the year.","Is the assumption if they address it later in the year through the debt ceiling because the bids are already in, they probably be looking at 2021 instead of 2020 in terms of addressing it or are you less optimistic because they'll even address it at all?","Brian Kane","So, let me take the 11% to 15%. We are reaffirming as we have our 11% to 15% that hasn't changed. I think this is important that investors understand the earnings growth that we've delivered over the last number of years, well in excess of 15% on a compound annual basis. And so, obviously, the HIF is a material headwind that we're dealing with and our goal is to strike the balance this year as it comes back to continue our advancement in the marketplace.","As it relates to policy, I think, the way you characterize it is right. We believe that there is bipartisan support to get rid of the HIF. It needs a vehicle to attach to and, as you said, it certainly doesn't look like that will happen before the bids happened and therefore we're bidding as if it's coming back.","We are obviously hopeful and are very focused on making sure people understand the impact that the HIF has on member benefits and the like, and so we continue to be advocates for repealing the HIF, and we're hopeful there this year as other legislation has taken up that will be part of it.","A.J. Rice","Okay, thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. Your expectations around the moderation of utilization for the MA business. Is that more a function of your existing book of business or is that in some way related to your expectations around these new members you've added during this special open enrollment period, presumably, these are all switches from other plans. So is the ramp up in profitability of that population perhaps better than what a traditional AGN is, that's question number one.","And then just number two, it seems like your commentary seems more encouraging around your Health segment business. Just I was wondering about and I'll be getting some more color and commentary around some of these investments you're having to make indeed the home care, home base and as well as your preparation for PDGM? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Sure. So, on the utilization side, I would say, it's really across the Board. We are seeing utilization of our new members, which are both switchers as well as folks new to MA or AGN. And really both all components of the business are performing better than our expectations.","Obviously, when you get the significant growth that we got, you ask yourself whether you in anyway attractive and unbalanced risk pool and that's certainly doesn't appear to be the case. And so the new members are running quite well as our what we call our concurrent members.","As it relates to healthcare service and we are seeing really nice performance in our Kindred business and our Humana At Home business home care, home base is being implemented. That's going well. We're committed to getting on home care, home base those one of the investments as you point out that we made this year. We think that will create a better clinical model ultimately for us as we continue to integrate with Humana and so that's going well.","As we've said from the get go, we're supportive of PDGM. We believe that better aligns our clinical focus and focus on health outcomes with the homecare model and where the payment model works. We'll encourage home health providers to run towards the more complicated in chronic members of patients and so we are very supportive of that.","Overall, we feel good about the investments we're making some of which are in healthcare services, some of which are in the retail and group segments but, as you said, I think healthcare services is off to a good start. We are seeing a little bit of softness in pharmacy that's just around the number of scripts we're filling because like we said, we're seeing lower utilization across the Board on our MA book, but other than that we feel very good about how broadly our business is developing here.","Amy Smith","Next question?","Operator","Next question is from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Scott Fidel","Hi, thanks. Just had a question on the PYD trends the research development, and trying to tie that together. I guess sort of two parts. One just on the retail segment. Just given how much higher the PYD was year-over-year, Brian, when you sort of add that back into last year. How did the MA margins actually look relative to the update you had given us that they were significantly below the long-term 4.5% to 5% range. So that's the first part of the question.","And then just secondly just given the negative PYD on the Group and Specialty segment and I know that you mentioned sort of looking at the risk adjuster settlement for some signals there, but just interested in how you guys are approaching either pricing or reserve assumptions, just to get back on the right side here in terms of the negative development in the Group and Specialty side? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Sure. On the MA side we are not, I'd rather not sort of put everything back into the incurred year. I think you can get a sense of that. We have PYD every year, but the good news is our book did developed favorably. So you are correct that will be called the incurred results for 2018 was better than where we finished year given the positive development, but I really don't want to comment any further other than to say our book continues to develop favorably, utilization assumptions that we made, closing the books for '18 turned out to be better as we get more results as we go into '19.","Remember it takes a number of months before the actual claims matured develop before you really know how you did, and so we're happy to see that '18 is developing favorably on the MA side. It is true that Group had, yeah, it's a small mountain and immaterial for the company, but group commercial did have some negative PYD in the quarter.","And again I think what we're seeing is that bifurcation in the marketplace and the community rate side what for us will be interesting to understand is how our book is progressing relative to the rest of the market and as the whole market deteriorating, are we deteriorating faster than the market. I think, the assumptions we have around our risk accrual are very reasonable and we will see again get what happens in June when that occurs, obviously, as we think about pricing our book both for MA and for Group.","We incorporate prior period development and our views, as I mentioned earlier of emerging experience because that sets the new baseline off of which we trend and so we do put that into the pricing, and so we will incorporate all of our best information that we have into pricing to make sure we're appropriately priced.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Sarah James","Thank you. Sticking on the home health topic, one of your peers recently quantified the company specific PDGM impact and it looks like one factor is where your home health patients are coming from whether it's acute or not. Can you give us some insight on to your mix of home health whether they are coming from acute or other sources. And if you think that Humana's PDGM impact could be better or worse than the industry average? Thanks.","Brian Kane","We don't go into that level of detail. I would tell you that Humana's mix will be more weighted, more acute settings and that's where our focus is as we think about our discharges and certainly where the opportunities are versus some of the more community-based settings that some of the home health companies have.","Again, we don't -- we are not going to give that level of detail. I would just say that the Kinder team is ready for PDGM, they're embracing PDGM. Obviously, there are some perhaps near-term financial impacts that frankly were anticipated in our deal model.","We knew there's some form of this was going to happen. So we anticipated the 2020 impact and we feel good about the assumptions we've made. But again, we're very focused on the incentives that provides the home health providers to take complicated patients and so we're excited about that.","Bruce Broussard","Yeah, just to add to that, and I know there's a lot of details in the reimbursement and especially if you're highly oriented to fee-for-service payment model, which the Kindred management team as Brian has said is really managing that transition.","More importantly for Humana as a whole, we feel there's a wonderful opportunity to address admissions, ER visits and other preventable events through home health and what we see in our initial test within data sites that we have going is that's actually the case is that we can reduce the utilization and institutions that are very reactive.","That is one of the things that I think is coming from this reimbursement change is really encouraging nursing to be more oriented to areas like COPD, diabetes, and CHF of which to date has been much more oriented to therapy.","So, within the home health sector as a whole, I think, that's much of a Kindred issue. They are managing that transition, feel comfortable with managing that transition and we invested in it based on a reimbursement change that would have some impact on lowering the impact from a therapy.","But, in addition, we see a great opportunity and being able to assist us and what our core business and that is really driving down the cost of care through preventing hospital admissions.","Amy Smith","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, Bruce and Brian. So just a question around your PBM operations and there has been some discussion around this moderation of generic drug deflation in the US market so far in 2019. So a couple of questions around that. I guess just first can you speak at a high level, how it may be impacting your PBM business and also your mail order profitability in particular.","But also curious just to hear about your overall pharmacy cost trends for your overall book of business in 2019 just went balancing this moderating generic deflation with what we've seen also as moderating brand inflation this year versus 2018? Thanks.","Brian Kane","Yes, on the second question, we don't break out the trend by service category. But you are correct that we are seeing favorable pharmacy trends as a general matter and particularly on the specialty side where we can have very significant cost, the pipeline has not developed as we forecasted and it's lighter than we expected.","And so from a trend perspective that's obviously a good thing. The question of a generic deflation and a lack of inflation is actually quite complicated. We think about it as holistically from both the PBM and then the impact from the plan and depending on the contracts you have in place with various manufacturers, it can be a good thing, it can be a bad thing.","I'd rather not comment further than that, other than to say, I think, our PBM business more broadly, I think, is gearing up, it's working to drive more volume into the mail setting. Historically in the last a year or so, as we mentioned, we are not getting the mail order penetration that we want to get.","We are very focused on driving that mail order penetration. We have really a state-of-the-art facilities to be able to service that mail order opportunity, and so we take over time it will be continued to be a source of growth for the enterprise.","Bruce Broussard","That's one of the strength of having the insurance component with the PBM side that you are the beneficiary of an ability to effectively manage the utilization on the price that drive, which shows up into the insurance product Part D and MA.","And so as you think about the integration that we have together are, we have a different perspective than somebody as a retailer, for example, that is having an impact that the volume and the price is an important part that shows up in the profitability of our insurance side.","And so as we are a little bit of a different breed as a result of it being integrated. Most of it is really -- our members and therefore they sort of work in harmony.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Amy Smith","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Can you give us an update on how you view your core cost trending or MA membership versus the growth factors that CMS is using in the rate setting process. I know the fee-for-service trend has accelerated into the 4% range in recent updates and it's actually closer to 5% and CMS projections in the outer years. So, are there demographics or other factors influencing that, where do you see the actual core trend in MA that you have to manage on a like-for-like basis?","Brian Kane","The way CMS formulates the rates and that fee-for-service trend factor is doesn't necessarily always really correlates the trend that we use in our pricing. And so it's sometimes hard to understand exactly how that trend is developed. We effectively take the rate we're given and then after sets for ourselves when our core trend is, and that's really the key assumption that we're focused on.","I would just say that we continue to see moderate trends, we see movement from the inpatient setting to the outpatient setting. We have seen moderating specialty trends, but we have seen as we commented higher outpatient and physician trends, and so we balance all those various factors. Obviously what matters is what you price and the development relative to that pricing and I think we've been very successful ascertaining what the various trend components are and then pricing it accordingly.","Michael Newshel","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce Broussard","Thank you. And I would like to thank all our shareholders for continuing to be strong supporters of the organization. And like every quarter our results and especially this quarter with great results we have could not be obtained without the 55,000 people that are working every day to help us. So, we really thank their dedication and efforts and allowing the organization to continue to be successful and with quarters like this. So, thank you and everyone have a wonderful day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for joining. You may now disconnect."],"11541":["Humana, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Ms. Amy Smith, you may begin your conference.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer and, Brian Kane, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our third quarter 2017 results and our financial outlook. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our Cautionary Statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed Risk Factors discussed in our third quarter 2017 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all also available on our Investor Relations site.","Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Amy. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we reported a strong third quarter results and raised our full-year adjusted 2017 earnings guidance. Our third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $3.44, or $3.39 on an adjusted basis, once again exceeded our previous expectations.","Our individual Medicare Advantage business continued its strong performance, in line with our most recent guidance. And our Group and Specialty segment performed well ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $11.60, reflecting the improved Group and Specialty segment performance.","This was partially offset by lower than the previously expected Healthcare Service segment pre-tax. Our full-year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance is now approximately $17.62 per share. Over the last several years, and particularly throughout 2017, we've committed to productivity initiatives designed to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. Following my remarks, Brian will comment on our third quarter results and some of the specific multi-faceted productivity initiatives.","In addition, in October, CMS published its updated Star Quality Rating Bonus year 2019 showing that we have 12 contracts rated 4 Stars or above and 2.4 million members in 4 Star or above-rated contracts to be offered in 2018. This represents approximately 74% of our Medicare Advantage membership as of July 31, 2017.","We are pleased that Humana received a 4 Star rating for five Medicare Advantage contracts offered in eight states, an increase from one such contract last year. All Humana Medicare Advantage HMO contracts in Florida received a 4.5 Star rating, improving our position with our provider partners. These higher ratings are expected to result in higher rebates in 2019. As discussed in our second quarter earnings call, over the last year, we've renewed our focus on Stars and have made operational changes to reduce volatility in future years, the effectiveness of which we believe is shown in improved results in certain Star measures.","As our sharp focus on productivity continues to drive cost out of the system, one area we are making critical investments is around our providers. A key pillar of our strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day in April is to partner with providers to support their transition to Value-Based care that fosters the management of health holistically. Medicare Advantage is one of the few reimbursement models that rewards holistic health management.","But primary care physicians on their own, especially independent physicians, lack the capital, scale and the expertise to make the investments in technology and analytics necessary to thrive in a Value-Based environment. To that end, we are making investments in payer-agnostic care coordination technology and analytics capability that enable providers to be successful in the Value-Based models, easing their administrative burden and enabling more time for clinical management of their patient population.","In a recent study we completed based on 2016 results for Humana Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Humana Value-Based reimbursement models, we found that medical costs for Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Value-Based models were 15% lower versus those affiliated with physicians under original Fee-for-Service Medicare. In addition, HEDIS Scores were 26% higher for providers in Value-Based arrangements with Humana than providers in standard Medicare Advantage settings.","We will execute our provider strategy using a range of models that fit the unique characteristics of a local market. This includes owned senior-focused primary care clinics, many of which are payer-agnostic, as well as joint ventures, alliance clinics and our MSO model, where we will focus on supporting affiliated independent primary care providers.","We spoke to you previously about our 2016 launch of four wholly owned clinics in Greenville, South Carolina. Membership growth in these markets has exceeded our initial expectations. And today, I want to share with you some early encouraging results that we saw between the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017. These results include: a 5% reduction in admissions per 1,000, a 24% decrease in re-admissions per 1,000, positive trends in member satisfaction with an improved Net Promoter Score and improved Star Scores associated with the patient experience. These results are a testament to the effectiveness of a Value-Based care model.","During 2017, we opened five additional clinics, including four in Kansas City and one in North Carolina. In addition, we continue to develop sophisticated Value-Based alliance and joint venture partners in new markets. In 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in seven markets. Among our alliance and joint venture relationships and our fully owned clinics, we today operate 195 clinics across 27 markets. We will continue to evaluate further investments and M&A opportunities in the provider space that improve our position in priority markets or accelerate the advancement and expansion of our MSO Platform.","Interwoven with our provider strategy, we continue to be very focused on the home, as home is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high-cost hospital admissions. In its current state, care in the home is often disconnected from primary care physicians, challenged with issues on timeliness of care, lacking in robust data exchange, as well as based on a Fee-for-Service-driven business model.","We've been utilizing our six existing Medicare Certified Home Health Agencies in Florida and Texas, along with enhanced relationships with high-performing agencies in select markets to pressure test some of these paradigms. Through these early tests and learned efforts, we've seen that these barriers can be overcome and the member and provider experience can be improved.","As we look to advance our Integrated Care Delivery Strategy and expand our access and reach in the home, we are taking a multi-faceted approach, including, but not limited to: care coordination, remote monitoring, telemedicine, and the provision of care in the home through nurses and doctors.","The insights we've gained from owning home health agencies demonstrates the value of having a home health platform to evolve capabilities and services, including integration of data, advancing moments of influence and transforming home health to Value-Based reimbursement. This model produces improved outcomes, such as lower admissions, re-admissions and emergency room visits and common high-cost conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD. This is a change from today's Fee-for-Service home health reimbursement model, which does not encourage the holistic management of health.","It also provides us with an additional touch point with our members to enhance engagement, trust and close additional care gaps, such as missing HEDIS measures. Many aspects of the care coordination are already in place and we continue to look for ways to expand and optimize these capabilities.","For example, our entry into the Long-Term Support Service business via our acquisition of American Eldercare in 2013, and the beginning of what is today our Humana At Home business with the acquisition of SeniorBridge in 2012, are becoming even more important as we continue to seek greater linkage of the Medicare D-SNP population and Medicaid Long Term Support Services.","However, other aspects of this strategy, particularly the provision of care in the home, will require M&A and other partnerships for collaborations to effectively bring them to life, as we've discussed previously. In order to advance our strategy, we need to continue to evolve the capabilities of our Healthcare Service segment. Accordingly, over the last several months, we have been working on a newly refined operating model to better align the Healthcare Services segment strategy, business and processes. The new organization will afford us a greater opportunity to engage our members, patients, physicians and associates to drive the best possible financial and clinical outcomes.","With this new organization, we recently named new leaders of both our Home and Pharmacy operations, who will work under the leadership of William Fleming, President of Healthcare Services. We welcome Kirk Allen to Humana to lead our Home operations as President of Home Care. Kirk brings more than 20 years of experience in health care and was most recently the President of Ascension At Home and Executive Vice President of Home Care Services at Evolution Health.","We also welcome Labeed Diab to lead our Pharmacy operations as President of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. Labeed is a registered pharmacist who brings extensive operations, management and business development experience in both the retail and health care industries, most recently serving as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President at Brookdale Senior Living. Prior to joining Brookdale in 2015, Labeed served in executive leadership roles for Walmart stores since 2009, most recently serving as President of Health and Wellness, which included managing retail pharmacies.","Now to touch on 2018. We are confident in our Medicare Advantage competitive positioning, despite the return of the Health Insurance Industry Fee in 2018. As a result of our over performance in 2017 and various cost-saving measures, we've made targeted investments in our product design, clinical programs and operating processes, which enable us to maintain stable benefits, simplify the member experience and improve clinical outcomes.","We've been proactive in our broker outreach this year, demonstrating for them our confidence in our stand-alone strategy and commitment to helping seniors achieve their best health. Additionally, we've worked to simplify the broker experience by investing in technologies that enable them to have 24\/7 access to our information, with further plans to roll out simplified enrollment tools in 2018. As a result, we expect to return to meaningful Individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2018.","Brian will provide additional commentary on our 2018 in his remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full-year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11.50, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $250 million at the midpoint to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, primarily due to continued better-than-expected financial performance.","Our Retail results are in line with our most recent forecast and continue to significantly exceed our initial expectations for 2017, led by our Medicare Advantage business. Consistent with the first half of the year, third quarter MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions.","In addition to our Retail segment producing strong results, our Group and Specialty segment significantly outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable prior period development and better-than-anticipated utilization trends. Trend is now running at the low end of our initial expectations of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Accordingly, we raised our pre-tax target for this segment for the second consecutive quarter from a range of $320 million to $340 million to a range of $350 million to $400 million. We also decreased our benefit ratio expectation to a range of 79.0% to 79.25% compared to our previous range of 79.75% to 80.25%.","The Group and Specialty segment continues to consistently deliver solid results due to the team's strong focus on productivity and on offering innovative products that resonate in the marketplace. We are pleased with the return on investment we generate from this segment.","As we discussed last quarter, while the Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent and, importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines, we continue to see lower-than-expected mail order utilization, particularly for new members in our Humana Walmart stand-alone PDP offering. Today, we slightly lowered our pre-tax target range for this segment to $900 million to $950 million from our previous target of $925 million to $975 million.","Turning to our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS, we now expect Individual Commercial segment pre-tax income of approximately $150 million, up from our previous estimate of approximately $85 million. Consistent with last quarter, these results reflect significant positive prior period development as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA-compliant business. With regard to cost share reduction payments, we do not expect the impact of the recent Executive Order to be material for us.","As these collective results demonstrate, we've had a great year so far, with significant outperformance that has enabled us to take the opportunity to invest in our future, including higher AEP marketing spend. This outperformance also results in higher compensation, as our performance-based compensation arrangements reward our associates for their excellent work.","In addition, as Bruce discussed, we have taken significant actions to reduce administrative costs in a sustainable way for 2018 and beyond. Some of these measures have resulted in incremental spend in 2017, including investments in analytics and enabling technologies that have significantly advanced our Integrated Care Delivery model, such as investments in our Big Data and our customer relationship management, or CRM, system, among others.","Our Big Data environment now enables us to integrate and routinely mine status sources such as clinician notes, home health assessments and social determinants of health data. Through our CRM, we now have comprehensive longitudinal data view of our members, which helps us know our members deeply and engage them effectively. We have also made investments in the provider space to advance care coordination capabilities, focusing on interoperability and analytics to improve the provider experience.","And lastly, we invested in a number of productivity and expense management initiatives related to internal management systems as well as vendor contracting and rationalizing our real estate footprint across the country.","More fundamentally, we have completed the build-out of the Process Transformation Office, or PTO, and we recently named Process Champions and Owners for three critical processes that together comprise over $1 billion in administrative spend. These include processing claims, resolving inquiries and issues and designing and delivering member communications. The PTO is working diligently with leaders throughout the organization to optimize these processes horizontally across silos, and has already identified meaningful savings by connecting upstream and downstream workflows and eliminating inefficiencies while ultimately increasing automation.","We believe that by focusing on these core areas and then extending the PTO to additional processes over time throughout the organization, we can continue to reduce administrative costs and increase the reliability of our processes while improving the member and provider experience that together will set us up for sustainable growth over the long term.","Lastly, as a result of our efforts to continue to evolve and streamline the organization to align with our Integrated Care Delivery Strategy that Bruce has articulated, we've had to make some difficult decisions, including closing certain open roles and initiating both a voluntary Early Retirement Program and an involuntary Workforce Reduction Program that are expected to impact approximately 2,700 employees, or just under 6% of our workforce.","In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $0.54 per diluted common share associated with these programs, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS. This has resulted in a higher operating cost ratio than initially expected for 2017, and we now expect to end the year at or slightly above the higher end of our previous forecast range.","We believe the culmination of these investments and our associates' hard work during 2017 has positioned us for a solid 2018 in the face of significant headwinds, in particular, the return of the Health Insurance Fee, or HIF. While we do not intend to provide specific 2018 guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher-level commentary and direction about next year.","I'll begin with membership. We are only one month into the Annual Election Period for our Individual Medicare Advantage, but we are encouraged, albeit very cautious, with early sales results and our competitive positioning. Our philosophy heading into this enrollment season was to maintain stable benefits for our members and, in some markets, improve benefits where we believe we were well-positioned relative to the competition. We did this recognizing that the return of the HIF presented significant challenges, given its magnitude and, therefore, as discussed previously, we invested our 2017 outperformance and made significant strides in administrative spend productivity to fund this benefit design for our customers.","We believe that balancing growth and margin are paramount, and it was essential after two years of stagnant membership growth, in no small part attributable to the Aetna transaction, to drive our top line in a disciplined fashion that would enable us to achieve our EPS growth targets of 11% to 15% over the medium and longer term. In this process, we have also strengthened our relationships and enhanced our partnership with the external brokerage community, who, along with our outstanding MarketPoint career sales organization, allows us to achieve this objective.","Based on what we know today, achieving individual MA membership growth in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 180,000 lives is a reasonable estimate. And while there are scenarios that could certainly reduce that number, including a sales slowdown for the remainder of AEP, there are also factors that could increase it, including greater-than-expected retention of existing members and higher post-AEP sales figures than are currently forecasted. It is important to note that data on member retention is very limited at this point.","I would also like to comment briefly on our forecast for group MA membership. Based on what we know today, which is significantly more certain than individual MA given the timing of the pricing cycle, we estimate membership growth to be comfortably in the low-double digits on a percentage basis for 2018. This achievement will be the second consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases in a highly competitive business, particularly for jumbo accounts, where we have committed to remaining disciplined with our pricing.","While we were pleased with our estimated growth in MA, there is some pressure in the competitive stand-alone PDP space for 2018. As you are likely aware, Humana offers three PDP plans, including a Basic Plan that serves, among others, our low-income members, an Enhanced Plan and a low-priced Walmart Plan, whose extraordinary growth has made us the leading individual PDP carrier in the country.","With regard to the Basic Plan, we priced to breakeven contribution margin at a regional level. In Florida and South Carolina, our bid proved to be priced over the benchmark, which we anticipated, resulting in the loss of our auto-assigned low-income members in those states. Additionally, our Enhanced Plan continues to lose members each year, but historically this has been more than offset by the significant growth in our Walmart Plan.","This year, however, the Walmart Plan is no longer the low-price plan in a number of markets, as other carriers have priced more aggressively. And as a consequence, while we will still grow that Plan, it will likely be at a materially lower rate. Collectively, therefore, we expect that our overall PDP business will decline by a few hundred thousand members. While the impact on PDP insurance profitability will not be meaningful, we expect the lower Walmart Plan growth will impact the growth of our Pharmacy business, given the industry-leading mail order rates in this plan.","I will now turn to making a few high-level comments regarding our projected 2018 financial performance. As we've discussed previously, Medicare Advantage membership growth drives top-line revenue growth that is a critical component of our long-term EPS trajectory.","Recall that MA membership growth not only benefits the health plans, but also feeds our Healthcare Services segment, as our members engage with us in our Pharmacy, Home Care and Provider businesses. Moreover, we are able to achieve increased scale with our administrative spend as the top line increases, which helps drive the bottom line over time.","From a profitability perspective, I have already highlighted the return of the HIF, which for overall Humana is a non-deductible fee in the neighborhood of $1 billion, as well as the impact of lower PDP growth on our Pharmacy business as meaningful headwinds toward our 2018 performance.","It is also important to note that we will not assume that our mail order rate in the Walmart Plan, while still very high, will recover from the lower levels of mail order usage that we have seen this year, particularly among the new members who joined us in 2017 and any members who select this Plan for 2018.","Our Provider business also continues to face significant rate pressures in South Florida. Additionally, the Group and Specialty segment will have a timing headwind associated with the HIF due to the timing differences that result from group renewals that are not on a calendar-year basis. And finally, there are certain stranded costs that result from our exit of the Individual Commercial business on January 1, 2018.","Together, the HIF timing issue and Individual business stranded costs represent a headwind of approximately $0.30. We expect to offset these headwinds through the productivity initiatives described above and capital deployment, both through share repurchase and M&A. It is important to recall that the impact of new Medicare Advantage members on profitability is relatively muted in the initial year before they are documented appropriately for the risk we are taking and are engaged in our clinical programs.","Turning now to EPS. Recall that on last quarter's call, we discussed the need to begin with a baseline adjusted EPS of approximately $11, which is largely unchanged. It is also important to note that we have achieved EPS growth well in excess of our long-term range over the last several years.","Additionally, we would anticipate guiding to a slightly wider range than we did in 2017, which should be more in line with historical practice, given our anticipated greater MA growth in 2018 versus 2017, which can create slightly more uncertainty in our earnings forecasts.","Finally, we would expect that the high end of our initial guidance range will be a bit below our long-term target of 11% to 15% growth, with our individual MA margin guide slightly below our 4.5% to 5% range. This reflects the significant headwinds that I've articulated and the importance of offering a compelling value proposition to our customers while continuing to invest in the build-out of our Integrated Care Delivery model that will create long-term sustainability.","Consistent with our historical practice, our 2018 initial guidance will assume a normalized rate of favorable prior-period development for our Retail segment, which exceeded expectations in 2017, while assuming no favorable prior-period development for our Group and Specialty segment.","Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the recently announced deal to sell our non-strategic closed block of Long Term Care Insurance business. Upon consummation, we will have no remaining exposure to this business, where we have seen significant reserve strengthening over the last number of years. Based on the terms of the agreement, the transaction is expected to result in an estimated GAAP loss on sale of approximately $400 million, or $2.75 EPS, which includes some non-cash charges.","That said, we do anticipate a net positive economic benefit for Humana as the $203 million of parent company cash contributed into the subsidiary, together with the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale, should be more than offset by the estimated $500 million of cash savings associated with the expected tax treatment of the sale.","We anticipate the transaction will close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Excluding the loss on sale, the company does not anticipate a material impact to earnings in 2017 or 2018 from the sale of the business.","With that, we'll open the lines up for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to understand a little bit more about why the change in the way you're giving 2018 guidance this time as opposed to giving more detail on a straight-up EPS number.","And also, your expectations for Medicare Advantage growth next year, given the increased competition we're seeing from others in the marketplace. Why do you believe you're going to see better growth there?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Peter. On the guidance side, we didn't actually give guidance of the third quarter last year either. What we're trying to give investors a broad direction of what we see 2018 to be. But there are still a lot of things that are going to happen in the next few months and we think it's appropriate and prudent to give guidance on the fourth quarter call, and that will be our practice going forward.","With regard to individual MA growth, really the reasons that I discussed in my opening remarks relating to the stability of benefits that we provided for our members and investing in certain markets where we believed we had a high right to win. And as we think about our value proposition and as we see the competitive data, we feel good about the range that we provided this morning.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I guess I wanted to go back and make sure I understood what the commentary was around the EPS guidance for next year. Did you say that you're going to guide below the range of 11% to 15%, or below the midpoint of that range?","And I guess when we think about the rationale for doing below that this year, would we think that there's anything unusual into 2019 that should stop you from getting to that long-term target?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. So, with regard to the range, what we said was, our initial guide at the high point will be a bit below our 11% to 15% range. So a bit below 11%, so it's not below the midpoint.","It would be way too early to comment on 2019 since we haven't given 2018 guidance.","The only thing I would say is that, given the HIF return in 2018, that's a particularly large headwind that we've had to deal with. I mean, a $1 billion non-deductible fee is a very big number. And so that's been a major issue that we've had to grapple with and it really affects our customers and affects our earnings performance.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just questions on Medicare Advantage and the outlook there. First, can you talk to the rationale between not being able to guide to a target margin at 4.5% to 5%, given how strong the business was this year? And specifically, you said, Brian, I think during the prepared remarks that cost trends are running better than what you built into the bids. Does this guidance, that lower than 4.5%, assume the bid margin or does it assume inclusive of a lower trend?","And lastly, can you just tell us what kind of attrition rate you're assuming for this year and how that compare for 2018 and how that compares to previous years in Individual MA? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Okay. Good morning, Justin. That was three questions.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Indeed.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Okay. Again, we've invested our outperformance in 2017 into the product design, which gets us to below that 4.5% to 5%. And that's really what's driving it. Again, we're facing very significant headwinds, as I've mentioned a few times with the HIF. We've I think done a good job of offsetting a lot of that headwind with very significant productivity savings that we've been very focused on and driving in 2017. I think you'll see that ultimately in our 2018 guidance. But that's really the rationale for driving below the initial targeted range of 4.5% to 5%.","I'm trying to remember now the second question. Justin, remind me the second question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","You'd said there was better trend.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sorry, right. So to be clear. Sorry about that. So, on the trends side, what I was referring to was the Commercial business trend. Trends continue to run favorable to pricing. But consistent with where we were really last quarter when we gave the updated guidance, nothing has really materially changed from what we saw last quarter. But on the Commercial side, we have seen continued lower trends and that's why we were able to improve our pre-tax guidance.","And, again, I really wouldn't want to comment too much on attrition embedded in our numbers. I would say that we feel very good about our attrition levels. I'm just not going to comment at this point. It's way too early to give a sense of where attrition will be.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Not to belabor the point again, but on your 2018 guidance, can you just talk to how maybe your view evolved over the last few months relative to how you described the outlook on the second quarter call?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I would say, Matt, it's really consistent. I think the business continues to perform quite well. We feel good about all the initiatives that we're pursuing. We made the decision at bid time to invest the outperformance into our 2018 product design. We believe that was the right decision to create long-term sustainability.","We also believe it's important to continue to invest in the business, which is what Bruce and I have talked about in our remarks. And so we're going to continue to do that. But I would say that nothing has really materially changed in our business outlook from this quarter from last quarter.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And if I could just one more, which is on the Medicare Advantage growth. How does your very preliminary view of the Open Enrollment process compare with what I understand to be CMS' prediction for 9% overall growth in program-wide enrollment, which I guess would include both Individual and Group?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","It's really hard to comment on how CMS calculates the numbers. I would tell you that what we've seen the last two years on the Individual side is a little bit less than 6% growth. For us, that's not an unreasonable way to think about market growth this year. But, obviously, we'll see where the data shakes out. But there's nothing that's meaningfully changed this year that would change that growth rate.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","Thanks. Good morning. Question is around the reductions in force and the voluntary retirement. And I'm just curious what the catalyst was there. Was there some sort of strategic review process? Was this sort of just, hey, post the Aetna transaction, we've got to start thinking about the business in a longer-term fashion? I'm just curious what created that. And was any of that tied to the MA bidding and the inability to get into that 4.5% to 5% range?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Really throughout 2017, we have been oriented to improving the productivity of the organization. And it's really to create capacity, both to be competitive in the marketplace from a benefit design point of view for our customers. And, as everyone knows, there's a continued need to invest in the business for long-term competitive positioning, whether it's in technology or it's in areas that are building capabilities, like in our Provider area or even in our Home area, which helps us with clinical outcomes.","So I wouldn't say it was really a planned process that we went through over the year. It came together at the end and the last month or so. But I would say that we've been working on these productivity initiatives really even before the Aetna transactional termination. And so, I wouldn't call it anything but just continuously trying to improve the productivity of the organization and reinvesting those dollars in our customer and reinvesting those dollars in the infrastructure of the company.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","All right. That makes sense. And just, Brian, real quick follow-up. I just want to make sure I understood. The starting point is $11 in terms of a run rate for this year, and that's the number from which you'll grow the high end slightly less than \u2013 or a bit less than 11%? Is that the right math?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","That's correct.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","Okay. Perfect.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The first question on the workforce reduction. What is the timing of realizing the run rate savings? Or is all of that termination happening by the end of this year?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We have notified the majority of the individuals. So, first, let me back up, Ana, a little bit. As I mentioned, we've been doing this throughout the year. So, we've had reductions that have begun to show up in our financial numbers probably starting in the second quarter or so. But this particular reduction will show up in the first quarter of 2018 as we transition the individuals out. The full transition would be done by the middle of January.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then if I could just do a quick follow-up. On the Physician Services, how do you not double count that pressure on your Medicare MLR outlook? And will that persist into 2018, or is that kind of done at this point? Because that's related to the rates in MA, correct?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","When you say Physician, do you mean our Provider business in South Florida, is that you're referring to?","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, right. Yeah.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. I mean, look, it's an interesting dynamic in South Florida. Those rates have continued to be ratcheted down over the last few years. We've seen that multiple years in a row. I would tell you to-date that the competition really hasn't changed fundamentally the benefit design there. And so, as a consequence, I think people have just had to get better and better to continue to drive profitability. But there's no doubt that profitability has been reduced in the Provider segment because of those actions.","We've also adjusted some of our contractual terms with our providers to help ease that transition and been very thoughtful about our benefit design and working with our provider partners. But net-net, it has had an impact on our overall profitability in that region in the Provider business.","As it relates to growth, as I said, I think the carriers and us included, I think have tried to be very prudent about how we deal with these rate declines and still offer compelling value proposition to members. And that's allowed us to continue to grow. I would tell you that were it not for those rate reductions, we would grow more. There's no doubt about it. But we've done everything we can to try to minimize the impact on the customer.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Hello, everybody. Just a point of clarification to Josh's question and then I want to ask you about Pharmacy. On the $11 base earnings, you commented, Brian, that you would guide differently than what your actual PYD was this year. Is that reflected in the $11 baseline start?","And then more broadly, on your Pharmacy comments. You've been able to drill down as to what's happening in mail order. And I know you guys did a strategic review of Pharmacy a few years ago, but there seems to be a whole lot of changes in the PBM landscape. Does that cause you to look at anything differently, partnerships, opportunities?","And then your push for integrated models. I know guys are talking about engaging with the pharmacists more. And at the Retail pharmacy outlet, you have your relationship with Walmart. Is there any evolution in how you're deploying that in terms of maybe provision of care in dealing with gaps in care?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, A. J. So, on the $11, what the $11 reflects is the 2017 outperformance. So effectively what that does is it takes into account the PPD for 2017 as we start our baseline. But as you think about 2018, when we grow off that $11 base, we're not going to assume the same level of PPD that's occurred.","So that's the distinction we make between the 2017 PPD that's effectively reflected. That outperformance is reflected in taking the baseline back to $11, but the 2018 guide will not assume the same level of PPD that we've seen in 2017. So hopefully that makes sense.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","On the mail order side, I would separate the mail order reduction we've seen and some of the broader questions that you're asking. It's hard to know exactly what's driving the mail order reduction, particularly for the new members. We think it might have something to do with benefit design. It could have something to do with just the nature of the risk that we're attracting versus the competition and where perhaps the higher utilizers are going. I think overall we're benefiting from a health plan perspective in terms of the risk dynamic we're seeing, but it has had an impact on the Pharmacy profitability.","More broadly to your question on strategic reviews and costs. We constantly are looking for opportunities to drive costs out of the system. We continually review our cost of goods. We continue to look at our cost to fill. And I will tell you that the Pharmacy team really does a fantastic job of being best-in-class in both of those areas as we look at the opportunities that are out there.","But as we've said multiple times, we are not wedded to any particular philosophy with regard to if we can find opportunities to drive out costs the system, we will do that. But what's critical for us is that the Pharmacy is a critical clinical engagement opportunity and mechanism with our members. And so that can't change. But as it relates to costs, we are always open-minded. And I will tell you, these guys do a great job of driving best-in-class cost of goods for our plan and for the Pharmacy.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","A.J., you did further ask the question around leveraging pharmacists and the ability to close gaps. We do think that pharmacists serve an important role in the clinical interaction with our members. And then today, in fact, we have quality contracts with a number of retail chains that allow that benefit to both encouraged pharmacists at the counter to do it and in addition to get rewarded for any kind of improvement in quality and clinical outcomes.","In addition, we are continuously adding pharmacy locations to our provider areas where we will have a pharmacy inside our Primary Care Clinics. And again, it's leveraging that moment of influence that the pharmacist has.","We are finding mixed results in our relationships with the retail pharmacies. In the clinical outcomes, we find where it's convenient and it's more in a clinical setting, it's more effective than it is in the retail setting. But I think that's also just the time that the pharmacist has at the counter to be able to have that engagement.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just wanted to ask a big picture question about the competitive environment in the Medicare Advantage business. Seems like you guys are working really hard to get to market growth, albeit at a target margin slightly below where you want to be long term. Do you think other participants are being a little bit more aggressive or slightly irrational in their attempts to grow membership at this point? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I don't know if I'd use the word irrational. But I think it's fair to say that our competitors view Medicare Advantage as an exciting growth area. I think they've invested a lot to grow their platforms and to expand their positions across the board, and it's just something that we're going to have to deal with.","I think we feel good that we are really in the Strike Zone of where the growth of Managed Care is happening. We believe that we have superior clinical programs and the right operating model to capitalize on that growth. But there's no doubt that we're facing a much stronger competitive environment.","And I would say that's been compounded by the fact that we have this massive Health Insurance Fee that's returning in 2018. That impacts the customer and it impacts the industry. And so, I think those two factors have required us to take significant action, which we've done this year, and invest some of the outperformance that we've had this year into our 2018 benefit design. But long term, I will tell you we feel very good about how we're positioned.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I would just add to that. I think as you look at the trajectory of the industry, it has a very strong demand trajectory. But I would also say that I think even on our investments we're making today that the competitive nature is going to evolve. And we think the competitive nature is going to continue to evolve to be much more oriented to a clinical approach as opposed to just from an insurance and pricing point of view.","And as you look at our investments, it's really focused on how do we continuously proactively help people with, especially chronic members, in managing their conditions. And I think long term, all organizations to be in this business are going to have to have some really clinical strength.","And we believe in the short run, we have to meet the competitive natures of pricing relative to the number of players being in the marketplace. But long term, we have to invest and build those clinical outcomes. And it's the combination of those two things you see the organization doing.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Gary Taylor, JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just had one clarification and then my question. And to be awfully redundant on the clarification, I just want make sure I have this perfectly correct. So, if we start 2017 base of 11%, we're going to grow a little below 11% to 15%, 11% growth will be $12.21, so something a bit below that. And you're going to give a wider range than the initial $0.30 range. Is that fair?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. Without opining on the $12.21, yes, that is correct.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just going back to the early retirement and the layoffs announced. I wanted to make sure I had Bruce's comments correct that you expect most of that to be effective in January, so you get a full year earnings benefit from that. Did I understand that correctly?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","You did, yes.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And can you give us a dollar amount that you're targeting? And then does most of that just come out of G&A?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I would say \u2013 so, these are big numbers. Ultimately, at the end of the day, our savings initiatives will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars for 2018. And I would say some of that is in G&A. Some of that will show up actually in our MER because of the nature of the associate base that's being impacted. That actually gets classified as an MER expense.","I think it's fair to say that when you look at our adjusted operating cost ratio next year, when you pull out the HIF and other things that you will see a reduction for sure. And we'll obviously give more color on that on the fourth quarter call.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi there. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. I wanted to just come back to the HIF so I can understand a little bit more specifically what parts of the business does it affect? I'd imagine maybe some of it is for exchange support. But can you give us a better sense of what departments these are coming in? And to what extent the savings are going to be used to offset the HIF, or is this going to be used to invest in initiatives you outlined in the prepared remarks about care in the home or the providers?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take that. I think it really is across the organization. There wasn't one area that was impacted both geographically or from a department point of view the organization. Really, as Brian has mentioned, is we're looking for productivity improvements throughout the company. So, I wouldn't say it's one specific area related to any one initiative we have.","In regards to the investment side, is it investing, is it going to the shareholders or is it going to benefits? I would say it's fairly, it's fungible and it sort of goes through all that. I think we've continued to manage in how do we invest in the business for long-term sustainability and compete in the local marketplace, how do we continue to have a competitive market offering.","And if you look at our market offering, you'll see that we're not the cheapest in the market. So we're constantly trying to ensure that we're not giving the product away and our brand and all the things we do from a customer experience point of view wins the customer over.","And then at the same time, we also look at the ability to invest in the advancement of our initiatives. And I would say it's sort of all those items. I wouldn't say we did it just to fund a particular initiative. We really worked through saying, how can we be competitive? How can we meet the long-term goals of our shareholders? And, at the same time, how do we ensure that we are productive in being able to also invest.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then as you're looking to reduce some of these costs, how do we get a little bit more comfortable from the outside that these don't impact your ability to move forward on trend benders?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah, I would tell you that we cherish the trend bender area. And I would tell you a lot of what we've done is to look at where are the areas that are less where it is not as impactful. But the trend bender area is a very important part.","And as you can tell from the script that I outlined, we are investing in the areas that we feel will affect the chronic conditions and really bring alive longer term-trend benders. And so investors should not worry about that. That is a passion of ours that is continuing to ensure that our clinical programs our advanced.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Thank you for the question. Can you just remind us what's included in that preliminary 2018 guidance, what the contribution of capital deployment is? And then you talked about some potential opportunities for M&A. But how do you view M&A versus share buybacks as we head into next year?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","At this stage, we're not prepared to talk about the specifics around capital deployment. I think you've seen our willingness to deploy capital in buying back stock, and we will continue to do that. And similarly, on the M&A side, it's really not something that we're prepared to give any more color around today.","Although then, just referring back to Bruce's opening remarks that we actively look for assets that advance our strategy. And we're going to continue to do that because it's important to do that. I would tell you that if we found an M&A opportunity that advanced our strategy, that would take precedence over share repurchase if it made sense to do that.","But we're very committed to share repurchase. You see that we have leverage capacity in our balance sheet. We're at 30%, 31% debt-to-cap. We have ample parent company cash to accomplish our objectives. And so we won't be shy about deploying our capital, obviously maintaining our investment-grade rating, which is also very important to us.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Just to clarify, when you give full guidance, I guess, in the fourth quarter, will we get more color on how much of that is coming from capital deployment?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah, we typically in our guidance waterfalls, we'll call out for you exactly what relates to capital deployment. So, yes, we will do that.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I appreciate the detail on analytics and data sources. Can you tell us how you're using that data? Is it on the Care Management to Clinical side? Or are you also following it into decisions on branding spend, marketing mix and product development?","Then do you feel that you have the technology and human assets that you need for your analytics? Or should we expect Humana to get more competitive and more prudent data scientists?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We have multiple sources of information, both clinically, which are coming from claims based to electronic medical records information, which also includes coming from notes within the Electronic Medical Records. So, you see that one side. But on the other side, we also pull a significant amount of consumer information, both from as much we can get from public, but also in the interactions that we have with our members.","So we look at how they're using the digital, from the Pharmacy point of view, what are the using the Pharmacy area, how they're using or are they using mail-order, are they using our Retail? And that gives us a lot of information about how their preferences on engaging in their healthcare. And so, I would say that there's a whole host of ways we go about bringing the analytics to the forefront.","In regards to the question on analytics and from a human resource point of view, we have over the last number of years, and we really haven't brought it out to our investors, have invested significantly, both in the Consumer Analytics and also in our Clinical Analytics.","And I think people would be very surprised at the depth of our analytics capability today.","We're always adding and expanding our clinical capability. It's just part of our normal planning cycle and our HR recruitment area. And so, I would say that, yes, to answer your question, that we will continue to be investing in that area.","But I would say today, we are in this area of predictive analytics and contextualization of the member, I would say we're fairly advanced in both from our competitive point of view, but I think in the industry in general.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","You said that you would be surprised at how much Humana has invested in Consumer Analytics. Is there any way for you to frame that up or size it for us?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I don't think I would do that. I think both from a competitive point of view and in addition we don't disclose that kind of detail.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple things. Healthcare Services, I hear that we still have some headwinds here. But also, I'm hearing that MA fees in the Healthcare Services \u2013 is Healthcare Services a headwind or a tailwind next year with respect to earnings?","And then good growth in group MA. But we're hearing that it's a pretty competitive environment there. Do you expect the margins there to come in kind of below your target range of 4.5% to 5% as you do with Individual, or do you expect margins to be maintained there? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Morning, Christine. So, I'm not prepared to comment on giving Individual segment guidance. I think there are pluses and minuses on the Healthcare Service side. Obviously, you mentioned MA growth. That's obviously a positive.","I've talked about some of headwinds on the Pharmacy side with regard to PDP growth, et cetera. So, I'm not prepared really to give segment-level specific guidance at this time. But obviously, we'll comment extensively on that on the fourth quarter call.","With regard to group MA, we've been very clear that we're going to maintain pricing discipline on that. As we've said before, our margins in group MA are not 4.5% to 5%. That is not a target margin Group MA. It is below that. But I think we feel pretty good about our Group MA business. I think the team is doing a really nice job of finding opportunities where we can earn a good return on capital.","And again, being very disciplined in some of these larger accounts where we can drive profitability as well as customer satisfaction. So, I think we feel very good about the positioning of our Group business.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, on the margin, is the margin a headwind or a tailwind do you think for Group MA next year?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Again, I'd rather not give \u2013 I'm sorry?","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is it easier to pass the HIF along because you're dealing with a group?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Typically, in the larger accounts that there's a specific adjustment for the HIF, particularly the jumbo accounts. But that obviously impacts overall growth in the space, but also potential willingness of a Group account to actually choose Group MA. So, there's some impact there. But it is, I would call it, a very transparent market, particularly at the large end. And so, the HIF is well known and it's discussed.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Bruce Broussard for closing remarks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Well, thank you. And, again, thanks to all our investors that support the organization over the years. You've been part of us.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Humana, Inc. First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Amy Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our first quarter 2018 results and our financial outlook for the full-year.","Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts.","This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, Humana.com, later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2018 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.","Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Good morning. And thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.36 for the first quarter of 2018 and raised our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to $13.70 to $14.10.","We continue to expect strong individual Medicare Advantage membership growth of 180,000 to 200,000 members for full-year 2018, and all segments are performing well.","We are pleased that we continue to consistently deliver strong financial results, while significantly advancing our consumer-focused health strategy, demonstrating excellence in operational execution.","We continue to be very active in building our primary care model. In March, we acquired the remaining 51% interest in MCCI and officially launched Conviva, bringing together our fully-owned and JV primary care assets in South Florida and Texas under one brand and one management team.","In addition, in April, we acquired Family Physicians Group, one of the largest value-based providers serving Medicare Advantage and manage Medicaid HMO patients in Greater Orlando with a footprint that includes 22 clinics. This brings our total owned JV and alliance clinics to 224, including 138 in Florida.","With FPG, we advanced our payer-agnostic primary care strategy, and we continue to look for options to accelerate capability development and geographic expansion of our value-based primary care and MSO support models.","We also continued to advance our strategy to integrate clinical programs that intersect healthcare and lifestyle, including in the home, where our Kindred transaction will be an accelerant of our strategy. The Kindred shareholders recently approved the Kindred at Home transaction, and we have been steadily \u2013 steadfastly moving forward with the development of the integrated clinical model.","One benefit of the Kindred at Home transaction structure that it allows us to focus on advancing our care models and associated impact on lowering the cost of care.","We are beginning to develop new clinical models, moving from reactive, point-in-time, triggered-based models of post-acute intervention to proactive, always-on models that leverage moments of influence for our members, including through Kindred at Home's care delivery capabilities. They are focused on in-home clinical and tele-health capabilities, including condition-specific best practices and robust clinical pathways.","We can improve the quality of care by using data analytics to predict when a member is at risk for an acute event and using that data to arm the physician and in-home clinicians with comprehensive view of the member.","As a result, we believe we can prevent an unnecessary hospital admission or an emergency room visit. We are creating test-and-learn pilots for a subset of Humana members in certain markets that we plan to launch when the transaction closes.","Some of the initiatives we are assessing include, improving the time to start of home healthcare by reduced administrative and other barriers, improving communication with the primary care physician, and seamless medication reconciliation and access to Humana pharmacists as well as other Humana resources and community support.","In addition, leveraging our partnership with our private equity partners, TPG and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, together we entered into an agreement to acquire Curo Health Services, a leading hospice operator.","Upon closing of the transaction, which we expect to occur subsequent to the closing of the Kindred transaction, we intend to merge Curo with Kindred at Home.","Kindred at Home is the largest home health provider in the nation and, combined with Curo, would be the largest hospice operator in the nation. Curo brings highly capable management team and a tech-enabled centralized model for hospice care.","By combining its strengths with those of Kindred at Home, patients will benefit from a better healthcare experience as their care team, physicians, social workers, family members, and caregivers help them navigate the continuum of home health, palliative care and hospice in an integrated fashion.","Turning to Medicaid, I'd like to thank our talented and dedicated Medicaid associates. As a result of their tremendous efforts, we received a notice of intent to be awarded a comprehensive Medicaid contract under Florida's Statewide Managed Medicaid program in 10 of the State's 11 regions, including the South Florida, Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando metro areas.","And we anticipate being able to continue to serve members in Region 1, creating a statewide offering. The comprehensive program combines the traditional Medicaid, or TANF and long-term care programs. While we are currently statewide for the long-term care program and we only serve five regions for TANF, although not final until an official protest period has concluded, we are pleased with the award of 10 regions in the comprehensive program, an achievement accomplished by only one other payer. This is a testament to the strong Medicaid capabilities that we have built over the last several years.","The award of a continued and expanded presence in the state will allow us to bring our integrated care delivery strategy to more Medicaid beneficiaries and more areas across the state.","As we indicated last quarter, we are seeing certain states to make a greater link between Medicare and Medicaid long-term support services capabilities for the D-SNP population.","The Florida award further reinforces our belief that the combination of our LTSS business and the strength of our Medicare Advantage offerings with our integrated care delivery model positions us to be a strong competitor to serve the Medicaid dual-eligible population.","Another key element of our strategy is to simplify processes and improve the member or patient experience, by removing friction points for our members and providers.","For example, as a result of changes we've made to our MyHumana website, including the addition of more benefit information and improvements in navigation, we are seeing more members prefer our digital channel over calling, including for those members coming to the site to pay their bill. From 2016 to 2017, our digital self-service rate improved 16% to nearly 54%.","In addition, we have implemented sophisticated analytics to drive predictive call routing, including analytics that match members with the most appropriate representative based on member communication style and the reason for the call.","As part of this initiative, our IVR picks up words a member says to why they're calling and we route them to the call \u2013 the call to the appropriate representative based on their training level. These initiatives improved customer satisfaction and reduced call transfer by nearly 153,000, or approximately 12%, for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.","We continue to look for ways to enhance the member experience further. We are currently piloting a program to train representatives to handle both mail order pharmacy and health plan-related questions regarding their medical and pharmacy benefits, which is further reducing call transfers between representatives.","As a result of initiatives like this, we continue to lead the industry in quality of the consumer experience. In the recently released, 2018 Temkin Experience Ratings among nationwide carriers, we ranked number two after TRICARE, a program that includes Humana.","The ratings are based on customer responses to three questions around their interaction with the company, including: to what degree they were able to accomplish what they wanted to do; how easy it was to interact; and how they felt about these interactions. Although, we have work to do, we are pleased with this recognition.","Before I turn the call over to Brian, I wanted to discuss the broader outlook for Medicare Advantage. In April, CMS issued the Final 2019 Rate Notice. After many years of rate reductions following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we are beginning to see a more favorable regulatory environment, which we believe is a result of the growing support for Medicare Advantage.","There is a clear recognition that the Medicare Advantage program provides affordable coverage for beneficiaries, reduces overall healthcare costs and improves clinical outcomes. The favorable Rate Notice for 2019 is indicative of this underlying tone.","Participants in MA generally receive benefits in excess of those available under traditional Medicare, typically including reduced cost-sharing, prescription drug benefits, care coordination, techniques to help identify members' needs, complex case management, tools to guide members in their healthcare decisions, disease management programs and wellness prevention programs.","Our data shows that relative to traditional Medicare, our Medicare Advantage plan generates significant per member, per month cost savings across a broad spectrum of services, including; post-acute, outpatient, physician and home health services, among others.","Similarly, Humana helps members access quality care in skilled nursing facilities and avoid higher cost inpatient rehab and LTAC settings. Accordingly, Humana members are less likely to be admitted to inpatient rehab or LTAC, relative to traditional Medicare.","CMS also recognizes that the issues go beyond traditional healthcare. We are pleased that CMS is permitting Medicare Advantage organizations to offer tailored supplemental benefits with flexibility to target the social determinants of health as recommended by a licensed medical professional.","Social determinants, such as food insecurity and social isolation can have a profound impact on members' health, and an important part of the care continuum is ensuring that we are able to address these needs.","For example, a member who is food insecure may have to make decisions not to fill their prescriptions, so that they can buy food. If a member is not taking their needed medication on a regular basis, it is likely their health will deteriorate.","The additional flexibility provided by CMS for 2019 will allow us to include some targeted supplemental benefits for our members that will directly address these types of needs and improve health outcomes.","In summary, we are proud of our significant accomplishments in the first few months of 2018 and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $3.36 for the first quarter. This exceeds our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable current year medical utilization in our Retail segment, relative to our initial expectations, some of which is attributable to a lower-than-previously expected flu impact, and also to positive prior-period medical claims reserve development in our Group and Specialty segment.","Consequently, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $13.70 to $14.10 from our previous guidance of $13.50 to $14. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS to approach 27% of the full-year number.","For the first quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS of $3.36 compares to adjusted EPS of $2.75 in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase includes, among other items, the impact of a significantly lower tax rate year-over-year, partially offset by investments made in the first quarter of 2018, both as a result of the tax reform law.","These investments include investments in our employees, primarily the establishment of an annual incentive program for a broader range of associates, as well as raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Additionally, we are making investments in the communities we serve, as well as spending on technology and on our integrated care delivery model to drive longer-term value creation and sustainability.","With regard to the flu, our consolidated benefit ratio for 1Q 2018 was negatively impacted by approximately 35 basis points from the incremental flu expense, relative to a typical flu season. Most of the impact came from the Retail segment and our Medicare Advantage business. While it was more severe than last year's, the flu season peaked sooner than we initially expected when we gave guidance, and accordingly, came in a bit below our previous expectations.","I will now turn to our segment results. All segments are performing well, reflecting strong operational focus and the effective execution of our strategy.","In our Retail segment, we experienced significant Medicare Advantage enrollment growth during the annual election period. This has been coupled with early positive indicators of medical utilization, relative to our expectations, primarily lower inpatient authorizations, while prior-period development has been in line with our expectations.","In addition, as discussed previously, the negative impact of the more severe flu season was not as high as we initially expected. Accordingly, we raised our full-year Retail segment pre-tax income guidance to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.61 billion from a range of $1.425 billion to $1.6 billion.","The updated pre-tax income guidance balances the positive early medical utilization indicators we have seen with the recognition that we have relatively limited actual claims experience at this point in the year, along with a significant number of new members. As such, our guidance does not assume those favorable trends will continue throughout the year. To-date, we have not seen any indicators that would suggest our new members are performing differently than our initial expectations.","Additionally, as a reminder, the year-over-year decline in Retail segment pre-tax in the first quarter was expected and is primarily due to the investment of the meaningful 2017 individual MA outperformance into our benefit design for 2018, investments made in 1Q 2018 as a result of tax reform law, lower-expected prior-period development and a more severe flu season than last year. These items are partially offset by significant operating cost efficiencies in 1Q 2018, driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017.","With regard to our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2019 plan year, as you know, we are in the midst of the 2019 bid season. As we prepare our bids, we are analyzing both the pre-tax and post-tax impacts of the HIF moratorium, the benefits of tax reform, the Final Rate Notice and potential competitor actions.","From a competitive perspective, we are limited in what we will say about our 2019 bid strategy until our bids are approved later in the year. Suffice to say, as we always strive to do, we will take a balanced approach to membership growth and margin, by offering a compelling product to our members in recognition of the significant rate and tax tailwinds. We also intend to drive meaningful EPS growth in excess of our long-term target of 11% to 15%.","Before discussing the other segments, I would like to echo Bruce's gratitude to our Medicaid associates for their dedication and tireless efforts that resulted in the Florida Medicaid contract award. We are working through the membership and revenue implications, but we do believe that there will be material upside relative to our current contract.","Turning to Group and Specialty, the segment continues to perform well, with slightly higher fully-insured commercial membership than initially expected and medical utilization generally running better than previous expectations, but still within our previous benefit ratio guidance range.","We continue to expect core trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, but biased towards the lower end, again with the important caveat that we are still very early in the year and our claims experience is relatively limited.","The increase in Group and Specialty segment pre-tax year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily reflects the impact of higher earnings in our fully-insured commercial medical business, including higher favorable prior-period development.","Consistent with the Retail segment, the pre-tax results for the Group and Specialty segment for 1Q 2018, include the impacts of investments made as a result of tax reform law as described previously, as well as significant operating cost efficiencies in 1Q 2018, as a result of productivity initiatives implemented in 2017.","For the full-year, we raised our Group and Specialty segment pre-tax guidance by $10 million at the midpoint, primarily reflecting prior-period medical claims reserve development that we experienced in the first quarter, which we do not forecast in guidance.","Shifting to the Healthcare Services segment, the pre-tax results in the first quarter were generally consistent with our previous expectations for the segment as a whole.","Relative to our initial expectations, our pharmacy business is running in line, while the provider business is running a bit ahead on the back of favorable prior-period development, and our clinical business is running just slightly below expectations. Consequently, we continue to guide to pre-tax income of $825 million to $875 million for the full-year.","Similar to the Retail segment, the year-over-year decline in pre-tax earnings for the quarter was expected. You will recall that we have undergone an optimization process that ensures the appropriate level of member interaction with clinicians, including graduating members into a monitoring program as their needs change, and transitioning them out of the care management program when they no longer benefit from these services. This drives higher quality outcomes and better returns on investment, while leading to reduced segment earnings. The full impact of this optimization is reflected in the quarter and projected full-year results.","In addition, the first quarter of 2018 includes the impact of investments made as a result of tax reform law, primarily investments in our employees, as described previously, and significant operating cost efficiencies in 1Q 2018, as a result of productivity initiatives implemented in 2017.","From a capital deployment perspective; in the first quarter, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that began in 4Q 2017. We continue to expect and execute additional share repurchases of approximately $500 million in the back half of the year.","Our expectation is that the Kindred and Curo acquisitions will utilize approximately $1.1 billion in parent cash on a combined basis when the transactions close sometime this summer, though the debt-financing plans are still being finalized with our private equity partners.","With regard to sources of parent cash, we expect subsidiary dividends to the parent in 2018 to be approximately $1.9 billion to $2 billion, almost all of which will be paid in the second quarter. This represents an increase of approximately $500 million to $600 million over the $1.4 billion we received for full-year 2017, primarily reflecting higher regulated subsidiary earnings in 2017 relative to 2016.","As a reminder, there's typically a one-year lag in our ability to pull cash out of our regulated subsidiaries. Additionally, the parent company receives the cash from the earnings of our Healthcare Services segment immediately.","From an M&A perspective, as I said last quarter, we continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions to build out our capabilities, particularly the primary care arena. But, we also look for any other assets that could enhance our other Healthcare Services segments.","Additionally, we would also have interest in Medicare Advantage assets that increase our presence in under-penetrated markets. We continue to target a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30% to 35%, consistent with rating agency expectations, with the ability to go higher for the right strategic opportunity.","With that, we'll open the lines for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The questions was about the difference in the Final Rate Notice from February to April, which look quite significantly good. Can you tell us what your thoughts are around the margins that you would target then into 2019 and the progression back to the 4.5% to 5%? Do you think that might accelerate? Or might you, again, just funnel that back into investments and the like?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Ana. Yeah, I'd rather not talk about specifically what we'll do from a competitive perspective, of course. But as I mentioned in my remarks, we do intend to guide next year to an EPS target in excess of our long-term target range of 11% to 15%. I know there's been a lot of questions about that, and so we thought it was important to make sure that was clear.","As it relates specifically to our 4.5% to 5% margin target, as we've said previously, we expect to make meaningful progress on the road to getting back to that margin level. Just as a reminder and to level set, one of the reasons, the major reason why we're below the margin target is because of the tax reform investments that we invested in our associates and in our business.","And as we've said, over time, we will work to get back to our 4.5% to 5%. But as I said, we will make meaningful progress in that regard next year and guide to a range above our long-term EPS guidance range.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. If I could just ask one follow-up. When you look at the selling season now and in context of the potential CVS Aetna deal with retail clinics and you are doing a lot of primary care, when you think about your clinical and your distribution strategy, do you have a mixed view of you should do primary care and clinics relative to retail clinics and store and the like? Or is it one or the other from a strategic perspective?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I mean, today, we are looking at all different ways to build and develop clinics, both standalone and retail centers, which today, we do in retail centers, not directly in the store, but adjacent to stores. And we'll continue to look at that. We do see convenience as being an important part of the decisions that individuals make when they choose a primary care clinic.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, thank you. Could you just talk about \u2013 sorry, let me ask you just on the individual business. This is now the second year that you've been out. It's separated from your operating results, and yet it's making a pretty substantial earnings contribution to you. How do you look at your strategy going forward about the potential to get back into that business, given how some of the dynamics have changed?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Matt. I think we continue to look at that as not being part of our core. I think as we communicated last year in our Shareholder Meeting that we are very oriented to staying focused on what we do well. That's been the Medicare individual or Medicare group and individual MA market.","We found that our clinical capabilities and our long-term engagement with individuals in the commercial market was really tough; it was very transitory, it was a market that seemed to use the healthcare system on spot basis. And that really isn't our long-term both strategy and our strength. And we feel there's a significant opportunity in the markets that we are in for significant growth, and we want to stay focused on building the capabilities to service those customers.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. And I can just \u2013 also one more on Florida and your expansion there. What are your thoughts about the capabilities that you have in that market, and generally, in terms of taking care of a broader TANF population, understanding that you already have statewide LTC, is that, hasn't historically been your preferred focus area?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. As we committed to the shareholders a number of years ago that we would build our Medicaid platform in concert of being able to serve dual-eligible.","And in the State of Florida, we've been working really hard in building our TANF capabilities. And we service five regions for a period of time in that marketplace, and we've built a fairly sophisticated capability in that marketplace that is affordable to any other state, it's not specific to Florida. We built it on a platform that allows us to expand that.","And I think the recent preliminary grant by the State of Florida for us to serve all regions in that marketplace is just an example of the consistency of our operating model.","So, I would say that we have the capabilities today to service members. I would say, it's just a continued expansion of our procurement process that we'll have to continue to look at as we go from state-to-state.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. Question on the services business. In the release, you spoke of a mismatch of the timing of sort of some of the lower revenues in that business and removing the associated operating expense during the first quarter.","Can you help us quantify those costs and how you expect them to trend down throughout the balance of the year to kind of get comfortable with the earnings ramp that's implied in guidance for the rest of the year in that business?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Let me give some context around the quarterly progression on (32:02), we're not going to get to too many specifics. First of all, it's important to note that it's assumed that the Kindred Healthcare transactions will close in the latter half of the year. So, there's some back end waiting there.","You mentioned the clinical optimization, and that's an important element, which is the revenue goes away but it takes a little bit of time to remove those costs. I'd rather not quantify that here, but it has a meaningful impact on our quarterly progression. There's also a few one-time expected items on the provider side related to the Conviva acquisition and writing off certain intangibles and the like. So, there are number of things that are assumed in the guidance that results in that quarterly progression. But as I said in my remarks, we feel good about where the numbers are today.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then a question on the small group market. Like some of the discussion there around trends and seeing some increased success with some of the level-funded products you guys are targeting there, couple of the stop loss. I was hoping you kind of could expand a little bit on what you're seeing there in terms of employer interest in these alternative funding products?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, as we said, they really are, I think, resonating in the marketplace, this notion of effectively an ASO product with a stop-loss wrap. We've seen meaningful growth in that area, and I think the financial performance is also really starting to perform, which we like to see. I think it's an attractive offering that gives our employers flexibility and really tailors the product to their needs. So, I think that's why it's resonating in the marketplace.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Thank you. And I'd like to remind everyone if they could please limit themselves to one question, so that we can get to everyone in the queue, we would appreciate it. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Question about the group MA market. You guys have been growing that pretty nicely, but I think you said that in this quarter most of the increase was related to sales to existing group accounts, which I assume means commercial accounts where you are selling in the group MA side of things.","So, if that's the case, it looks like also maybe your larger account ASO business is in decline. So, is there any negative implications of those two trends that you're selling mostly to your own customers, but you're seeing some attrition in that customer base? And what is, therefore, the long-term outlook on group MA?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, Kevin. So, what we meant on that comment about group MA is that we're in an existing group MA account where we materially expanded the amount of lives that were covered in that particular group MA account. It put more members into the group MA program rather than Medicare secondary. So, it's unrelated to the commercial side.","We also won some nice smaller accounts as well and added organic growth in our existing business there too. So really the group MA business is performing quite well, but from a membership perspective as well as from a financial perspective.","Obviously, the ASO commercial business, there are some opportunities to cross-sell and the like. That's not where we've been particularly focused, given the fact that we don't have a very large presence in the commercial ASO space, but I think we've been and the team has been very successful at going out and finding new accounts and competing where it makes sense from a financial perspective on some of these larger accounts. So like I said, we feel very good about how the group MA business is progressing.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, are you saying a slice business or are you saying med supp turning into MA?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Medicare secondary. It's effectively a med supp product that group accounts have the option they could go through a group MA product or more of a traditional supplementary wrap.","So, in this one instance that I was referring to is that they are putting them into our group MA product, because it's compelling both from a financial perspective for the accounts. It also offers very attractive benefits for the beneficiary. So, it's really a win-win.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just want to talk broadly about \u2013 or ask a question broadly about the benefits of a retail partnership and what you think would be the benefit to Humana and, specifically, the Medicare Advantage lives to have a more expanded retail partnership? Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We pride ourselves on partnerships in general. I mean, we've been successful both in providers, retailers, such as our Part D product that we have, along with other people that are part of the healthcare system.","A retailer provides, I think, some interesting access points for customers that are more convenient. We would think that it would be closer aligned to more of a primary care clinic extended by some lighter care services that could be a referral source for that. And then obviously, any kind of distribution opportunities that would be created from that.","Now in our Walmart relationship that we've had long-standing, we've had a very successful Part D relationship with them. In addition, we are part of their distribution, insurance distribution channel that they have and actually manage a lot of that for them. And we see that being in the stores as helpful and convenient for the customer, and in addition, it just drives further traffic to the clinical models and in addition to the distribution model.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","And I'm sorry, just a follow-up, Bruce, you've been selling MA. I know you've got folks in their stores. Is there meaningful growth in Medicare Advantage as part of that relationship? Or do you think there's more opportunity outside of the Part D to actually generate new sales leads and growth in MA as well?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We have \u2013 our market point sales people are in the stores, they would be selling both. They would be selling MA and Part D as a result of that. So, it's just another access point for people to, as they're in the store to learn more about the benefits of MA and Part D. And so, we do have our distribution channel inside the store there. And their customers are making decisions around Medicare.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hello, everybody. Thanks. I'm going to ask about capital deployment. It looks like you've laid out pretty well what you're going to do with the share repurchases you've done already and will do for the rest of the year. I guess when I think about what you're doing with home health and hospice, my original understanding and I might have been wrong, was that the Kindred at Home vehicle would be the vehicle to go forward and the primary focus would be on that self-funding its growth.","I know you've stepped up and done this Curo, which may have been just an opportunistic one. But, do you see once you put those two together, is that vehicle now got the capability to self-fund what it's going to do in the future? Or do you see more capital commitments there?","And I think two other areas you mentioned for capital, even in the prepared remarks, MA, geography expansion and capabilities expansion and physician acquisitions. Can you give us a sense of what might be the types of size and scope of capital outlays in those areas and whether you think you'll see something this year? Or are there projects that you're actively considering at this point?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, A. J. Let me take that one. So, I think on the other capital in Curo and Kindred, we feel pretty good about how that company is now positioned in terms of the capabilities that it has.","Obviously, we'll always look for assets that make sense. Our sense today is that that business will be able to self-fund as they look for additional opportunities in the home health and hospice space.","That said, we have a very good relationship with our private-equity partners, and if something makes sense, we would certainly look at it. But I think it's fair to say that from a sort of material capital deployment perspective as we sit here today, the $1.1 billion that I mentioned is the number that I think that we can feel pretty good about.","As it relates to other potential deployment, it really \u2013 I mean, we obviously look at a number of things, I wouldn't be prepared today to commit to something specific in terms of size. We'll look at small transactions, for example, the FPG transaction versus we'll look at larger deals as well, that really depends. But I'm not prepared today to commit to specific capital spending levels. But whatever we do, we're pretty disciplined about how we deploy that capital.","I think we're judicious about the optimal forms to get that capital. I think the Kindred deal is an example of that, and so we'll always look to deploy our capital optimally.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. I just want to come back to the Retail comments that you guys had made about early indications of some cost trends that you see that are looking favorable.","I think you had spiked out the lower pre-authorizations, and then, of course flu was a little bit less than you had guided to. Can you flesh that out and just remind us what the guidance is for? Is that really just less flu and some prior-period development? Or are you factoring in any of the early indications from the pre-authorization trends? And any other data points on medical utilization that you could flag for us would be great.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. So, I would say a couple of things. There is some beneficial flu impact in there, but there's also, really focused on the first quarter, some of the early indicators of positive medical utilization that we've seen.","As I mentioned, we haven't assumed that it carries forward, and I think we've been very reasonable in the amount of benefits we've recognized in the first quarter and in our guidance.","As I mentioned, we just want to be, again, very prudent about the claims experience, recognizing that we're still early in the year. But particularly on the inpatient side, we are seeing favorability in our authorizations. And I would say, the other service categories are running fine as well.","And so again, I think it's a good start to the year. We feel very good about how we are positioned from a medical cost trend perspective. Frankly, both for the Retail side and on the Group side, I'm sorry?","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And pharmacy trends. I know you mentioned the inpatient pre-authorization. Anything on pharmacy?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah, pharmacy, I would say also running well. Scripts are largely in line with our forecast, maybe slightly better, might be slightly lower than we had anticipated. There's some different mix issues and the like that impacts the cost. But overall, I would say, we're running in line or perhaps slightly better.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. If I could just follow-up a little bit on that last question, one of the things we've noticed from the hospital this quarter is fairly large jump in acuity growth in the first quarter, probably more noticeable than any real volume pickup. Could you describe what visibility and\/or lag you have between seeing inpatient census and pharma claims versus actual acuity of those claims?","And I guess what I'm trying to get at, is there some lag between what you might be seeing on your pre-authorizations versus the actual acuity that comes through the claims once fully quoted?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. We can see preliminary data on that. I think it is fair to say that there is some higher acuity or what we call cost per admission, what we're seeing in the data. It's still something that we are analyzing, part of it may well be the fact that because more of the admissions are moving to outpatient as opposed to inpatient, what's left is a higher acuity level. But that's something that we are analyzing. But again overall, from an overall utilization perspective both rate and volume, we feel good about where we are.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the question. I just want to go back to the comments earlier on the Final Rate Notice and the opportunity to do supplemental benefits. Can you talk about your capabilities there, any capabilities you may need to add and what the opportunity you see as over the next couple of years if that remains? Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. One of the things about the supplemental benefits, details are still coming out. So, what they are and how they work are going to continue to need to be refined.","But in general, over a number of years, we've been working on supplemental benefits through both connecting with charitable organizations, and at the same time, incorporating it in our process and workflow.","At this time, I don't think there's anything that I would say that we couldn't deliver through partnerships and other means that would need to be altered in any fashion. We feel very, very equipped and capable as we look at both our clinical programs and the relationships in our communities.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning, guys. Wanted to ask a general question, just help us think about integrated care opportunities. Can you give us a general sense of sort of the mix of medical costs or the percent inpatient, outpatient drug?","And sort of pursuant to that, I would be curious to know what sort of hip and knee surgeries represent as a percent of total and how much the bundle of care initiatives can save in broad strokes. Any kind of rule of thumb there would be helpful.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah, I'd rather not comment on specifics like that. As we've said in the past, inpatient is probably 25% to 30%; outpatient, another 25%; physician, I think is 15% or 20%, and we use some capitation in there; and pharmacy is the rest.","But I think that's broadly what I would point to, so call it, 25% to 30% inpatient, and then call it 20% outpatient, 10% pharmacy, and then the rest sort of other and we have a bunch of different payments we make to our providers and the like, and capitation.","So, that's how I sort of break out or frac out the medical spend. But as it relates to specific hip and knees, I'd rather not comment on that. But I would just say more broadly, we're always looking for opportunities to engage with our providers in a value-based way and we think bundles is an interesting opportunity and something that we continue to pursue.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","We have a number of programs in the test-and-learn phase in different markets and we have found to have significant benefits both on outcomes and on cost. And we'll continue to pursue those on kind of more conditioned-based.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Has Florida made any commitment to you to getting you to critical mass on the new products? As I look at the auto assignment algorithm, it says that it won't favor anyone's plan, but that's not really clear if that means round-robin or if it would at least get you to a minimum critical mass. And then does this win influence how you think about the need to go out and buy mixed books in order to continue your LTSS growth strategy? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Why don't I take the first question and then hand to Bruce. With regard to the sort of allocation, the algorithm methodology, there are some parameters laid out in the proposal. We feel good about sort of what I'd call material upside relative to our current revenue and membership. There could be some movement there, but I think we feel pretty good about how the methodology is laid out. Obviously, we've got to get through all the protests and the like, but that's really what I'd say on that front.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And the second front around acquisition and being able to build additional capabilities, we feel really good about the capabilities that we have from a clinical point of view and from a service point of view for the Medicaid population, both in the TANF area and, in addition, in the long-term support service area combined with the Medicare Advantage duals opportunity.","Where I think we would constantly look to see if we needed additional capabilities would be in the procurement area, where there's already an existing relationship in that particular state or market, and the barriers-to-entry are much greater outside of just the core capabilities you have. And so, it would be more of a procurement review as opposed to a capability side.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line (50:21) with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on the quarter. Just looking at the funding math here, you did Curo for $1.4 billion and Kindred for $800 million. And then you're guiding towards $500 million repurchases in the back of 2018. And if you use $1.1 billion of parent cash, should we expect you to tap the long-term debt markets anytime soon?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I'd rather not comment specifically on our financing plans. Obviously, we'll ensure that we're adequately capitalized and have sufficient liquidity. We also have, as you know, a large commercial paper program.","But again, just to make sure that you have the math right, it's $1.1 billion for both Kindred and Curo. So, there's a debt financing component that will be done at the asset specifically, would be non-recourse to Humana.","And so that's where the $1.1 billion is. Effectively the $800 million we talked about before and approximately $300 million for Curo, that could move a little bit plus or minus. But that's probably how we're thinking about it. But we have sufficient capital to execute what we've laid out.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.","Amy Smith","Thank you and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Cane, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2019 results and our updated financial outlook for the full year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the line for a question and answer session with industry analysts. We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management\u2019s prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana\u2019s website, humana.com later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statements. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our second quarter 2019 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce Broussard","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.05 for the second quarter of 2019 and raised our full-year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $17.60, primarily reflecting improved results in our retail segment. We are pleased to deliver these strong results while experiencing the highest individual Medicare Advantage membership growth we have see in the last decade, which is reflective of our operating discipline and execution, investments in our integrated care delivery strategy, and our relentless focus on creating a simple and personalized healthcare experience for our members. ","Today we are raising our full-year 2019 individual MA membership growth guidance to a range of 480,000 to 500,000 members, primarily reflecting improved rest of the year growth projections for agents and our dual special needs plans. Through the end of the second quarter, our DSNP membership grew approximately 21% or 46,000 members from the prior year, demonstrating our ability to serve the unique needs of this population through our benefit offerings and the deep clinical programs and services we\u2019ve built over the years.","Seniors are increasingly choosing Medicare Advantage because of the program rewards high quality of care, fosters deep relationships, aligns incentives under a consumer-based model designed to manage the sickest, most vulnerable beneficiaries, encourages a holistic view of member health, and creates the competitive market forces that encourage innovation. The aging population and the ongoing increased penetration of Medicare Advantage as a percentage of total Medicare eligibles combined with our strong brand and value proposition gives us confidence in our long-term membership growth prospects. ","It is important to note that our growth trajectory is balanced across product lines, including HMO, PPO, and DSNP, individual Medicare Advantage offerings, group Medicare, and Medicaid. To drive this broad and balanced long term growth, we are investing in capabilities that create sustainable member value with a focus on five key areas of influence: primary care, home, pharmacy, behavioral health, and social determinants of health, which we outlined at our March investor day. ","We also spoke to our consumer-centric, health outcomes-focused operating model enabled by technology. As we invest further in these capabilities, our investment approach encompasses both the type of investment as well as the return horizon, balancing both short term growth and long term sustainability. We consider the implications of our investment in terms of their ability to advance our strategy and create sustainable competitive advantage. Important too is the risk profile of the investment in the context of structural changes in our industry and the speed at which those changes are occurring. Following this philosophy enables us to vary our approach based on both enterprise and local market considerations via wholly owned investments, both organic and through purchases, partnerships, or direct contracting. Some examples of our success in deploying capital with risk-based return criteria include our primary care partnerships, minority investments in Kindred at Home, and minority investments in start-up organizations to encourage and learn from innovation. ","Today, I\u2019d like to highlight a few ways we are delivering on our commitments from our investor day. In primary care, our investment strategy comes to life through our multiple pronged approach to expanding access to value-based care. We may own, partner or contract with providers based on the local market dynamics and appetite for value-based contracts. Over the years, we\u2019ve fostered deep relationships with providers, meeting them where they are as they evolve to value-based care. This oftentimes includes our supporting them through reporting and analytics complemented by dedicated human resources. As a result of these longstanding relationships, approximately one-third of our individual MA members are cared for by providers in full risk arrangements, and another third are cared for by providers under value-based arrangements along the path to full risk. ","Included in our full risk arrangements are wholly owned and JV alliance clinics which allow us the agility to stand up high quality senior-focused primary care in underserved markets. By the end of 2019, we expect to open 40 new clinics, nine of which have already opened, expanding our footprint to 272 primary clinics. This includes 12 new partners in primary care clinics, including five new clinics in Houston as well as three additional pilot clinics with Walgreens in Kansas City and Anderson, South Carolina. ","In the home through our minority investment in Kindred at Home, we are piloting value-based care models in multiple markets and continue to see encouraging results from a standalone financial perspective for Kindred at Home, and from the standpoint of delivering improved clinical outcomes for our members. To usher in the next wave of integration, Humana and Kindred at Home have invested in an interdisciplinary team of clinicians responsible for taking the best practices gleaned from pilot markets and applying those learnings across Kindred\u2019s broad geographic footprint.","In our pilot markets, we have seen 1,800 home health episode authorizations year to date under the new value-based model compared to 600 in all of 2018. The expanded coverage area includes six states - Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, representing over 90 Kindred at Home branches. For the full year, we expect a total of nearly 20,000 home health episode authorizations under the new value-based model for both pilot markets and expanded coverage areas.","In addition, we are preparing for the upcoming changes in 2021 when individuals with end stage renal disease will be eligible to enroll in MA. We are contemplating how we can expand options for these members and incorporate the home as an alternative site of care. We are also working with CMS on ways to enhance care, address structural barriers that exist in the dialysis market today, and ensure appropriate funding. The methods and systems in place today do not incentivize dialysis providers to focus on slowing disease progression and result in provider payments rates in excess of original Medicare. Accordingly, we are working with dialysis providers on potential alternative contracting models, including risk contracts and value-based models, to make care more affordable while driving desired clinical outcomes.","Turning to our technology strategy investment, let me first highlight the key elements of our approach. We are focused on building an enterprise technology platform that can be leveraged across all our business channels, bringing together disparate systems and data both inside and outside the company with the end goal of being the creation of a single, intuitive longitudinal health record for each of our members. It is through an interoperable platform like this that we are able to deliver a seamless, simple and personalized healthcare experience. Creating this platform requires developing several layers, specifically data, analytics, and experience layers centered on customer-focused use cases.","The data layer includes the governance and structure that allows for ease of integration and the consumption of multiple data types, including for example free text, images and voice. This layer then facilitates deep analytics in the mix layer. The analytics layer includes a set of contemporary tools for the use by our data scientists to develop advanced models while creating user-friendly intuitive tools for data analysts and others in the company to access in the experience layer to improve insights, capabilities, and ultimately allow for more proactive care.","The experience layer enables a user experience that is simplified and personalized in the context of member circumstances and preferences. By integrating the insights from the analytics layer through a convenient and contemporary mobile app, we increase consumer engagement and ease for providers, which in turn enables the capturing of additional contextual information that informs our interaction and enhances our data and analytics to determine the next best action. ","Most importantly, we are building an integrated platform utilizing the most contemporary technology and partnerships. Our deployment is modular and based on specific customer use cases with clear business needs. Let me share a few examples.","Last year we announced the creation of Studio H in Boston. While it\u2019s early, Studio H is beginning to launch innovative products. Humana is the first health insurer to make member ID cards available in Apple Wallet. Also, in Greenville, South Carolina we are piloting a care management application for care coaches in our clinics which integrates the electronic medical records and provides a view of the members with the most critical and immediate needs. As a result of the success of this pilot, we plan to roll out the application to all partners and primary care clinics by the end of this summer. In addition, we organically built One Med List, a medication therapy management tool that enables the provider and caregiver to have a real-time view of member adherence, improving clinical outcomes. ","We also recently announced a collaboration with Epic, the most widely used comprehensive health records system, that will integrate technologies to enhance patient, provider and payor access to health information. We are the first national healthcare insurer to collaborate with Epic to power value-based care. We believe interoperability is a core consumer principle and are fully behind CMS and HHS\u2019 push to free data for the benefit of healthcare consumers. Together with Epic, we are advancing interoperability to promote open communications and information transparency that will give patients and their clinicians integrated and real-time access to the patient\u2019s medical history, health insights, and treatment options, which in turn enables cost reduction, improves quality, and increases patient satisfaction. To enhance the prescriber\u2019s experience, we are integrating our real-time benefits check tool, Intelligent Rx, directly into Epic\u2019s e-prescribing workflow, delivering real-time pharmacy data throughout its network. Physicians will be powered to weigh evidence-based outcomes with patients\u2019 individual medication, cost and coverage. ","All these advancements in technology in our integrated care delivery model along with many other initiatives designed to personalize and simplify the consumer experience have resulted in continued recognition of our leading position in customer satisfaction. In June, we were ranked the number one health insurer among all for-profit and not-for-profit health insurers in Forrester\u2019s 2019 U.S. Customer Experience Index, which measures how brands build loyalty with the quality of their experience. This achievement reflects the dedication of our employees to helping our members achieve their best health, and we are pleased that we expect eligible employees across all levels of the organization to receive higher than targeted compensation from our annual incentive program. The expected higher payout is due not only to above-target individual membership growth and earnings per share but also as a result of improved customer satisfaction as measured by our net promoter score.","Before turning the call over to Brian, I\u2019d touch briefly on 2020. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we continue to expect reasonable growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2020 and believe we have struck the appropriate balance between membership growth and margin for our individual Medicare Advantage business. As Brian will discuss further in his remarks, we are making significant investments in 2019 to create sustainable customer value and lessen the impact of significant 2020 headwinds on member benefits and premiums in 2020. That being said, millions of seniors across the industry will likely see a reduction in benefits and\/or increased premiums next year from the expiration of the health insurance fee moratorium. As we have mentioned before, there is bipartisan support to eliminate the HIF. Given the significant positive benefit the removal of the fee would have on members, we continue to urge Congress to repeal the HIF.","In addition, we are committed to our standalone Part D, or PDP product as it is an important product for seniors and Humana. We acknowledge that in the last two years, our PDP portfolio hasn\u2019t achieved our growth expectations. Our PDP design focus for 2020 was to evolve our portfolio to ensure we can offer a competitive product to consumers to achieve our long term membership growth targets.","As we look beyond 2020, we are proactively pursuing initiatives designed to advance personalization and simplification, investing in technology and clinical program to move more proactive holistic health interventions while also continuously pursing productivity initiatives. In addition, we\u2019re working to shift the broader healthcare conversation and focus to include healthcare policies that address not only coverage but also the cost and affordability of care. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Cane","Thank you Bruce, and good morning everyone. Today we reported adjusted EPS of $6.05 for the second quarter. This exceeds our previous expectations primarily due to higher revenue and better than expected medical costs in our retail segment. The favorable utilization of that we experienced earlier in the year in our retail segment relative to our initial expectations has persisted, and we are also seeing better than expected results in our healthcare services segment. This favorability was partially offset by lower than expected results in our group and specialty segment.","The strong year-to-date 2019 performance has positioned us to make additional strategic investments in the back half of 2019 to support our members\u2019 health, enhance customer experience, and lessen the member impact of the headwinds we face in 2020, all while increasing our full year 2019 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook. Today, we raised our full year revenue guidance by approximately $900 million to $64.2 billion to $64.8 billion and increased our adjusted EPS to approximately $17.60 from our previous range of $17.25 to $17.50. This represents year-over-year consolidated revenue growth of approximately 13 to 14% and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 21% in 2019. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to approach 26% of the full year number, which factors in the expected negative impact of weekday seasonality in the third quarter and higher investment spending in the back half of the year. ","As Bruce stated in his remarks, we are excited about our ability to execute our strategy and deliver strong results well in excess of our long term growth target of 11 to 15% while also achieving 16% individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2019, which not only significantly exceeds the market growth rate but also is the highest net membership addition Humana has experienced in any year in the last decade. As a result of our expectation of achieving adjusted EPS and individual MA membership growth in excess of our initial targets, and because of the increase in customer satisfaction as measured by our net promoter score, we intend to reward our associates with higher performance-based compensation under our annual incentive plan. The increased compensation is for eligible employees across all segments and all levels of the organization.","Importantly, we were able to identify these positive trends soon enough to be able to invest this outperformance into the bids for our 2020 Medicare offerings to help reduce the impact of the 2020 headwinds on our customers. Additionally, we have been working diligently to identify and invest in initiatives in 2019 to further lessen the negative impact of these significant 2020 headwinds. Specifically, we are executing productivity initiatives and accelerating investments in our integrated care delivery model across all segments. These investments include, among others, automation within the clinical and pharmacy spaces to drive better and more efficient outcomes, customer support services to simplify and streamline the customer experience, artificial intelligence for commercial small group risk assessment and quoting, an enhanced dental platform to set up our specialty business for the future, technology innovation and integration to drive interoperability, including our partnership with Epic that Bruce highlighted in his remarks, and marketing investments in partnership with the external broker community.","As a result of the increased investment spending coupled with higher employee compensation driven by our strong performance, we increased our full year consolidated operating cost ratio by 20 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 11.1 to 11.5%. ","I will now turn to our segment results. While I will not repeat the impact within each segment, keep in mind that the increased annual incentive compensation and investment spending affect all segments. ","In our retail segment, all lines of business are performing well, particularly our Medicare Advantage business. We continued to see favorable utilization relative to our initial expectations and higher than expected growth in our individual MA membership. We raised our full year individual MA membership guidance range to an increase of 480,000 to 500,000 members from our previous range of 415,000 to 440,000 members as our products continue to resonate in the marketplace. We are also seeing higher per-member revenues and increased our retail segment revenue guidance by $700 million to a range of $55.8 billion to $56.4 billion. We have also lowered our benefit ratio guidance for the segment by 30 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 86.4 to 86.8%. ","As it relates to our Medicare Advantage offerings for 2020, I remind you that contracts are not final until September and we have not seen competitor plans, so we do not intend to comment specifically on our 2020 offerings at this time; however, we have worked hard to create a competitive product and lessen the impact to members from the significant headwinds we are facing, which I will discuss further in a moment. ","For our standalone prescription drug plan business, we now expect a decline of approximately 700,000 members in 2019 as compared to our previous expectation of a loss of 700,000 to 750,000 due to slightly less disenrollment. As Bruce stated in his remarks, we believe we have taken meaningful ground in evolving our standalone PDP portfolio for 2020 but recognize that it may be a multi-year path to return to PDP membership growth.","Lastly for this segment, our Medicaid business is running slightly ahead of expectations, an important marker of success given the amount of new members we took on this year after our statewide win in Florida. ","Turning to our group and specialty segment, as I said last quarter, our level funded ASO product for small groups continues to gain traction in the marketplace as groups migrate out of the community rated segment. Small group membership comprised 37% of group ASO medical membership at June 30, 2019, up from 18% at June 30, 2018 and 26% at December 31, 2018. This migration to ASO has resulted in a modest deterioration of our community rated block, which resulted in additional negative prior period development this quarter. Furthermore, the increase in small group ASO membership with stop-loss, which generally carries a higher benefit ratio relative to our other fully insured products, is also impacting the benefit ratio. As a result, we increased our segment benefit ratio guidance by approximately 100 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 82.4 to 82.8%. ","We continue to forecast core trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, and we now expect full year 2019 pre-tax earnings of $225 million to $275 million for the segment, a decline of $75 million from our previous expectations. Keep in mind, as previously discussed, this range contemplates higher employee performance-based compensation and increased investment spending to position the business for a strong future.","Lastly from a segment perspective, healthcare services is performing above expectations and we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year by approximately $40 million at the midpoint to $1.05 billion to $1.075 billion. ","Our home business, including Kindred at Home, is performing well and we continue to see operational improvement in our Conviva care delivery assets as well as better than expected results in our new partners in primary care clinics. Pharmacy is also performing well fueled by higher than expected individual Medicare Advantage membership. ","Turning to operating cash flow and capital deployment, we now expect full year cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, an increase of $500 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. This increase is primarily driven by the operating outperformance and the positive working capital impact from higher than expected individual Medicare Advantage membership. Years where we experience significant increases in membership generally result in higher operating cash flows as premiums are collected in advance of claims. ","With regard to parent cash, the subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019. We continue to expect subsidiary dividends to the parent for the full year to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion with the remaining balance expected in the fourth quarter of this year. As a reminder, the parent company also immediately receives cash from the non-regulated earnings of our healthcare services segment and our Tricare business. ","From a capital deployment perspective, as announced this morning in our press release, we intend to enter into a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement after the market close today. After the completion of the ASR, we will still have ample capacity to execute on our strategic priorities given our parent cash position and current low financial leverage. These M&A priorities include assets that can enhance our integrated care delivery model as well as tactical health plan acquisitions. ","Lastly, as we look to 2020, while the headwinds we face are significant particularly with the return of the health insurance fee, we have worked diligently to position the company for a successful year on both the top and bottom line. Specifically, we are investing meaningful effort during 2019 to find ways to drive down 2020 administrative costs through end-to-end process redesign, leveraging automation, and streamlining certain corporate and market functions, all while enhancing longer term sustainability. Additionally as mentioned above, our strong performance this year is enabling us to accelerate important investments from 2020 into 2019, and we have also been able to incorporate the 2019 outperformance into our 2020 MA bid design. Finally, the exceptionally strong membership growth in 2019 provides tailwinds into 2020 as members are documented appropriately and enter our clinical programs. ","Collectively, we believe these factors will position us effectively in the marketplace next year. We are also reiterating our expectation of reasonable EPS growth off the initial $17.25 guidance midpoint but below our long term target of 11 to 15%.","With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good morning. Building on the comment around the 2020 positioning, obviously last year you mentioned that you expect 2020 growth to be below the long term range of 11 to 15. Given that now you\u2019ve submitted the bids and all the improvement that we\u2019ve seen this quarter, any updates to that? ","Brian Cane","Well, I would just reiterate what I just mentioned in my remarks, that obviously we\u2019ve worked very, very hard to mitigate the impact. The impact is significant, but we do have a number of tailwinds that we\u2019ve incorporated into our bids, but nonetheless it\u2019s still a material headwind that we have to deal with. Again, we believe we\u2019ll have a competitive product out there for 2020, and again, just reiterating our EPS guidance, high level guidance from last quarter. So I would say that certainly the second quarter outperformance helps us from a bid design perspective, but we still face meaningful headwinds for 2020.","Ricky Goldwasser","Then one follow-up, if I may. You talked about your technology strategy, and I think one of the debates in the marketplace is that seniors tend to utilize less digital into their medical benefits, or how they manage their medical. Based on the pilots that you\u2019ve done, what are you seeing in the marketplace, and do you think that this is an opportunity that the market is underestimating?","Bruce Broussard","I would say we continue to see growth in the use of seniors and technology, and we continue with the agents that that will be the case. But more importantly, what we see as being the enabler of technology and where it really comes into play is streamlining within the healthcare system to allow the ability to have more information, to then allow us to have deeper analytics that then allows us to have more proactive interventions. I would say that the investments are around a consumer orientation for self service kind of activities, but it\u2019s much more around enabling providers to be much more proactive in being able to treat and prevent conditions from progressing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Kevin Fischbeck","All right, great. Thanks. I\u2019m just trying to understand the commentary here because trying to put the 2020 outlook, it really hasn\u2019t changed, I guess from the wording at least that you\u2019re using as far as reasonable growth off of 2019, but it does feel like the membership growth has gotten better in 2019, which should help 2020. It sounds like you\u2019re making a lot of investments. Is there a reason why you\u2019re still using the same language, or is there any directional color you might provide within what a reasonable range might be as we think about 2020?","Brian Cane","Good morning, Kevin. We are not prepared to do that. We\u2019ll give more specificity on our third quarter call, as we typically do, and detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call. As I said to the prior question, the second quarter outperformance has helped our bid design, and it\u2019s important to invest those dollars for customers and to ensure that we have a competitive produce, and we\u2019ve worked very hard to do that. You can\u2019t underestimate the impact of the health insurance fee on our customers, and we\u2019ve done everything we can to try to mitigate that.","Bruce Broussard","Kevin, I would just add to Brian\u2019s comments, I think out of all the industry players and we as a result of having high PMPM revenue, the industry fee disproportionately affects us more versus others in the industry, so our headwind starting out of the gate was greater. We have worked with this balance of ensuring that we continue to deliver appropriate margin improvement to our shareholders and at the same time continuing to have a competitive product in the marketplace, and at the same time have availability to invest in where we see the industry going with technology and clinical programs. It\u2019s that balance that the management team has faced, and we see the overachievements in 2019 helping achieve that balance. If you were to sit in our day-to-day meetings, you would see that we are very focused on continuing to improve the productivity of the organization, both in the capital deployment area, which was evident by our ASR today, and the ability for us to reinvest our organic growth into returning to the shareholders, but then secondarily also in continuing to invest in the productivity aspects of our business. It\u2019s a high order to try to achieve all these headwinds, but we are working hard on behalf of our shareholders and customers to overcome it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please ask your question.","Peter Costa","My question is on Part D. Given all the changes that have been talked about in Washington on Part D, in particular the Senate Finance Committee bill restricting the Part D program, you\u2019ve talked about revitalizing your Part D program, and then yesterday, you just saw the bids that came out, national average bid. What\u2019s your expectation for growth in Part D for next year and then for the years beyond that?","Brian Cane","Well there is, as you mentioned, a number of proposals out there on Part D that we\u2019re obviously sorting through. As Bruce mentioned in his remarks, we are committed to growing the PDP product over time. It\u2019s an important part of our portfolio, our customers like the product. It\u2019s important for our pharmacy business, and so you\u2019ll see some meaningful product repositioning in 2020, which we\u2019ll talk more about when everything\u2019s finalized on the next quarter call, but we have to see where things shake out versus our competitors. As we mentioned, over time we are committed to growing this business again.","Peter Costa","So by repositioning, do you mean you\u2019re going to re-trench back next year a little bit?","Brian Cane","No, not necessarily. Again, I think we have to see where our competitors ultimately shake out with their benefit design. I would say that we have made some meaningful changes in our plans and we\u2019ll see how those resonate, but it\u2019s important to understand where the marketplace is before we can comment. ","Bruce Broussard","I think right now, just to add to Brian\u2019s comments, Peter, we are working hard to reposition, as he said, to a product that we feel would be competitive in the marketplace. Due to some constraints in structure within PDP and other things, it\u2019s not an easy task to navigate through, but I think when plans are published publicly, you\u2019ll see that we are thoughtful about how we approach that.","The second thing, similar to what we\u2019re doing in the MA space, we are also focused on how do we continue to make it easier for the brokers and in addition for the customers and oriented to segmentation within that area, so it\u2019s really a two-part approach. We are hesitant to give any kind of estimates because we don\u2019t know the comparator to how we would fit in the marketplace, so it\u2019s not about being timid about next year, it\u2019s just really we are committed to the product, we are committed to making change to make it competitive, but it\u2019s just how do we look to others in the marketplace.","Peter Costa","Okay, thanks. Great quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. You may go ahead and ask your question.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. First, just a clarification. I want to make sure, Brian, I heard that you were talking about not coming in with your long term growth rate in 2020. Was that off the 1725 base that you referenced last quarter, or is that off of the higher base this year?","Then my real question is just around the accelerated share repurchase that you\u2019ve announced for this evening. Is that just a simple confidence in the core, feeling a little bit better about 2020, or should we read into that around short term M&A and maybe lack of opportunity there?","Brian Cane","Good morning Josh. I was referring to off the 1725 on the first part of your question as the baseline, and again that\u2019s really a function of the fact that we\u2019ve taken this outperformance, as I mentioned in my remarks, and invested that into the bid. As we think about the adjusted baseline, we think about our initial guidance, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s off the 1725.","As it relates to the ASR, we do feel that our stock is a very good investment, first and foremost. Secondly, we have ample capacity, and doing a billion dollar ASR today really doesn\u2019t meaningfully impact that capacity to execute our strategy. As I mentioned we are looking at a number of what I\u2019d describe as tactical M&A opportunities and we have ample capacity for that, so I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. ","We recently received our dividends up to the parent company and we\u2019ve deleveraged pretty meaningfully from the last ASR that we did, so we felt it appropriate and a good investment to buy back stock.","Bruce Broussard","Josh, just to add to that a little bit, one of the unique aspects of Humana has been the strength of our organic growth and the ability for us to generate cash without having to buy earnings, and that has allowed us, I think, to be more opportunistic in returning cash to shareholders and specifically more in stock buybacks. As you\u2019ve seen in the past, we do deals, but the deals have been more oriented to adding capabilities as opposed to just expansion of our existing customer base, because we feel that our value proposition in our existing customer base is strong and enhancing that value proposition through adding capabilities has been the strategy longer term. ","Josh Raskin","Makes sense, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Matt Borsch","Yes, hi. Congratulations on the great results. I have a question about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the overall growth in the MA program. Obviously we can track that, but I\u2019m curious in your perspective, do you think that there\u2019s a pick-up in the MA penetration with agents? I know before, you\u2019ve talked about you see it more in the, if I\u2019ve got this right, 67, 68-year-old population where the MA product is more typically taken up. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing that changing at all.","Brian Cane","Yes, there\u2019s no doubt that over the last several years, there has been a pick-up really across age ranges in MA penetration, Matt. You\u2019re right in that as people get to 67, 68, 69, that penetration tends to increase. I think what happens when people age in, they\u2019re deciding what makes sense, not quite ready to make a commitment. For those who want a Medicare supplement plan, they\u2019re able to get it without getting underwritten, which has some benefits, and then they take their time and figure out what the right plan is.","We\u2019re very bullish on the long term prospects of the MA market. If you exclude the Minnesota cost plans this year, which distorted the growth rates, you\u2019re going to see individual MA growth well north of 8%, we think, and that\u2019s obviously quite a robust number. We don\u2019t see any reason for that to stop. ","Now again, the HIF does provide headwinds for next year and so I think that could on the margin impact the growth rate, although we haven\u2019t seen that necessarily materially swing the appeal of the product just because of what we\u2019re able to do and all the things that Bruce articulated in his remarks. It is a richer product, there are more benefits. Importantly, there also are care coordination benefits that members don\u2019t get in traditional Medicare, even with the Medicare supplement policy. They\u2019re left to navigate the healthcare system on their own, so that\u2019s where we think Medicare Advantage has great promise and people are really voting with their feet.","Matt Borsch","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Justin Lake","Thanks. My question is on the updated guidance for \u201919. Your MLR guidance in the retail segment appears to be pretty conservatively biased relative to the first half performance and the typically seasonality we\u2019ve seen in the last couple years. Should we read that to assume that you\u2019re not guiding to the better utilization you\u2019ve seen continuing in the back half, and if so, should we assume that your bids only reflect the first half outperformance rather than assuming it continues for the full year?","Brian Cane","Morning Justin. I would characterize the back half more a function of seasonality and things of that sort. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Our bids do make an assumption about our full year estimate, so we do make a full year estimate. We don\u2019t assume that utilization is going to get better from where it is today, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that you assume it\u2019s going to trail forward largely as how you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ll see where the back half shakes out. We feel good about the guidance that we\u2019ve given for the back half, but I think some of the differential there is some seasonality factors going on in the back half of this year. ","Justin Lake","Brian, is there something different about the seasonality? You know, what I\u2019m looking at, and I could be wrong in my math, but it looks like your retail guide for MLR is basically flat in the second half versus first half. In the last two years, it\u2019s been down 300 basis points first half to second half, and obviously we know about Part D seasonality. Is there something new?","Brian Cane","I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s something new, other than for typically the third quarter, the workday pattern is different and it\u2019s just a higher utilization quarter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years. I think that\u2019s probably the main difference. Small changes in workday seasonality can have a pretty material impact on your MERs, so again I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. Like I said, we feel good about the guidance we have out there and we\u2019ll see where it ends up.","Justin Lake","All right, thanks for the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee","Thanks for taking the question. I had a question about the Epic partnership that you\u2019re talking about here. Does this also include basically you\u2019re going to be implementing Epic across all your clinics, and if that\u2019s the case, can you talk about what capex expectations you have as you roll that out over, let\u2019s say this year and next year, and also does this include maybe now looking to partner with other EHR vendors to coordinate care with members that might not be going to a place like that uses Epic? Thanks. ","Bruce Broussard","Yes, it doesn\u2019t contemplate rolling out Epic to our clinics. It is really more of an interoperability opportunity versus anything else, and it\u2019s not very material an investment for us as an organization. It really highlights the power once the interoperability is operating of being able to have both easier workflow within the Epic system on behalf of certain administrative matters from us as an organization, but secondarily also the ease of opportunity for us to be able to utilize that information to provide back to the providers on more proactive care management and coordination of care. So it\u2019s a great opportunity, we are excited at the relationship with Epic. I know they\u2019re excited with the relationship with us and being able to take this and be the payor that\u2019s really helping lead them create a payor channel to facilitate a much better and simpler experience, both for the member and for the providers that are using their system.","Charles Rhyee","Great, thanks. I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but did you touch on the group segment here? I know it\u2019s relatively small, but the MLR was a little bit higher than expected. Is there something here as you think about balancing pricing versus growth and cost? Maybe if you could touch on that a little bit more? Thanks.","Brian Cane","Sure. I talked a little bit about it in my remarks. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s really necessarily a pricing dynamic, it\u2019s really a mix dynamic as our book continues to evolve away from the community rated small group space, which has some choppiness in it and just has different dynamics in terms of medical expense ratios, etc. We continue to invest in this business more broadly. We believe there are a number of opportunities for us to play a role in this space and offer a compelling product, so part of the guidance also reflects investing both in the traditional group commercial space but also in the specialty space, meaning largely dental, which runs very good margins and it\u2019s a business that we want to grow particularly as we sell and cross-sell more of it, both to our individual members on the Medicare side as well as our group commercial members. We continue to invest in that segment and we\u2019re bullish about its prospects. ","Charles Rhyee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. You spoke about 2019 investment spend being some pull forward and some incremental spend, specifically I\u2019m talking about the increased amount in the second half. Can you offer more color on what the step-down could be in spend in 2020 by sizing the 2019 non-recurring investment spend that was more strategic, and also the pull forward from 2020 into 2019? ","Brian Cane","Morning Sarah. I think that\u2019s a very fair question, but we\u2019re really not prepared to give that level of granular detail. I would just say that, as I\u2019ve said multiple times, we have worked hard to set up 2020 to be a good year, both on the top line as well as the bottom line, and in order to do that we recognize that we still need to invest and make the business sustainable, so to the extent we can bring investments forward and accelerate them into 2019, we\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re also, I would say, making incremental investments in 2019 that we don\u2019t necessarily have to make in 2020 so we can accelerate all the things that Bruce articulated in his remarks, because it\u2019s important that we think beyond just 2019 and 2020 and over the next number of years, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re investing for.","So I\u2019m really not prepared to give you specifics - it\u2019s not immaterial, obviously, but again you should take the message that we\u2019re really trying to balance our short term, some of the pressures that we face with long term sustainability.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Dave Styblo","Hi there, good morning. It\u2019s Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. A question about just recognizing that you don\u2019t have the individual MA competitive landscape for 2020 yet, do you think you can grow well above the industry average again next year given the accelerated investments you\u2019re making in the second half, as well as incorporating some of this year\u2019s upside into the bids?","Brian Cane","It is too early to comment on our relative positioning. We just don\u2019t know the answer to that. I would just say that we have worked hard, as I said, to create a competitive product, and obviously we need to see what others do with their benefit design. We are more impacted, as Bruce said, from the HIF that we\u2019ve talked about, so we do have those incremental headwinds that we have to face, but again for all the things we\u2019ve said in the last hour here, we\u2019re very focused on trying to mitigate that.","I would also say that we continue to invest in the broker channel. They\u2019ve been great partners for us, really across the board. We wouldn\u2019t be in the position we\u2019re in were it not for the external broker channel frankly, as well as all the great work that our internal market point team does as well, so we are very focused on cultivating those relationships and giving them the dollars they need to support our product. That\u2019s another element of our strategy. ","But we\u2019ll see where it goes. We\u2019ll know more in the next few months where the benefits are, and obviously we\u2019ll have more to say on the third quarter call.","Dave Styblo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Michael Newshel","I just wanted to clarify on the impact of mix shift in the group business. The higher benefits expense ratio there, that\u2019s just the risk pool getting worse because employers are switching to self insured are relatively healthier? I know that\u2019s not a new trend, but is it just the magnitude there of risk deterioration has been worse than what you priced for?","Brian Cane","Again, I don\u2019t know if I would call it necessarily risk deterioration. It\u2019s more just the mix of our membership as they move from one segment to the other and what\u2019s left is a worse risk pool, so from that perspective, yes. Frankly, a lot of the back-up on the MER that isn\u2019t stop-loss related--remember, our stop-loss product is priced at a much higher MER than traditional commercial insurance, so as that mix shifts, remember the ASO is parallel to stop-loss, as that mix shifts you\u2019re going to get higher MER.","We\u2019re also impacted this year by some negative PPD - prior period development, from last year that has impacted the medical expense ratio this year, and so year-over-year it\u2019s not an immaterial change for the segment. Remember that this segment for us is very, very small and so small changes and arguable immaterial changes for the company nonetheless have outsized effects on some of the ratios that you see. I think that\u2019s important to take into account as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll make this sort of a two-parter on 2020. The first high level question is when you guys talk about headwinds, it seems to be plural, but the only one that I think I\u2019m very comfortable with is the return of the HIF, so wondering if you could maybe walk through headwinds and tailwinds at this stage, what else we should be thinking about especially on the headwind side.","Then beyond that but also on 2020, back in June you previewed expense reduction initiatives at our conference, and I just wanted to clarify if that\u2019s one and the same as the productivity initiatives you discussed this morning, and wondering whether you might be willing to comment on the expected or targeted impact on next year, and if not, sort of in numbers terms maybe provide some qualitative color on materiality in the context of year-on-year EPS growth. ","Brian Cane","Sure. With regard to the headwinds, we probably made it plural because the HIF is so big. It is very material. I would also say, though, that while the rate notice was good and actually positive relative to not last year but years before that, we still have trend we have to overcome, unmanaged trend that is in excess of that, so those are just the natural headwinds we typically face. But there\u2019s no doubt that the health insurance fee is far and away the biggest headwind, and it\u2019s a big one. As you know, it\u2019s non-deductible as well, so it\u2019s a big number. That\u2019s really the primary one.","With respect to expenses versus productivity, yes that is the same set of activities that we\u2019re undertaking to reduce our admin spend for 2020 while also, I think, setting us up for a stronger company going forward because of the way we are streamlining processes and rationalizing our business. I would say it\u2019s material. I would say it\u2019s definitely meaningful for next year the amount of cost that we\u2019re taking out. As you said, we started talking about this many, many months ago. We started this last year knowing that the HIF could very well come back, and so unlike the 2017 experience where arguably we had lower hanging fruit to go after, we had to really go deeper here to figure out what areas could we be more productive. I would say the teams across the board have done a tremendous job of identifying, and now we\u2019re in the process of executing the initiatives that we\u2019re talking about here. But they are material, and we\u2019ll talk more about it in the coming quarters.","Steve Tanal","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, Bruce and Brian. There\u2019s clearly been a lot of questions on the outlook so far, but back on the 2Q results, specifically the MLR coming in well below consensus estimates was obviously a bright spot in the quarter, especially with really minimal benefit from prior period development. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any additional color you can provide on what seems to be an enhanced ability to control medical costs. Obviously other managed care companies and maybe other books of business have had some more mixed results this year. Is the biggest factor just tied to better engagement of members into your clinical programs, or what else would you call out as really the most critical factors? Thanks.","Brian Cane","Sure, it\u2019s a fair question. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of things. Bruce went through a number of things in his remarks, and this integrated care model that we\u2019ve created and all the various touch points that we\u2019ve discussed do move the needle. They definitely do move the needle and, I think, give us a good handle of what the costs are and what members are in need of our clinical intervention . I think that is a part of it.","I think we also have a very good handle from our tight financial and operating linkages that we\u2019ve created. I think finance and operations are very tightly aligned and that allows us to see trends early. Really when we see potential issues in trend or we\u2019re seeing a market or a particular product or whatever it may be that\u2019s running a little bit hotter than we expected, we can immediately identify and go after it, so we\u2019ve been very focused and proactive about that. ","But look - it\u2019s not an easy business to manage. All of our costs are estimated, and so it\u2019s important to identify these early warning systems that can allow us to identify the issues and then create the clinical programs and the customer engagement platform, and frankly the analytics to be able to identify who needs the intervention. We continue to invest in that. We\u2019re nowhere near where we need to be. This is going to be more and more important over the coming years as the tools we invest in continue to develop, and you\u2019ll see us continue to talk about that. Also, having new distribution channels that we\u2019ve created, whether it\u2019s Kindred or a PIPC or other areas where we can engage our members in different ways, that\u2019s why we continue to invest those channels and in the technology that supports it so we can continue to manage our medical costs. ","Steven Valiquette","Okay, appreciate the extra color. Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Just kind of a two-part question. One, when we think about the MLR upside versus your original guidance in the first part of the year, are you able to ascertain if more of that is coming from this large bolus of new memberships versus where that might typically be when you enroll a new member, or is most of it coming from your retained members, and if so, how does that inform your thinking about 2020 bids and margins?","Brian Cane","I would say our new members are running in line, maybe slightly better than expectations. I\u2019d say a lot of the upside is in the existing block, both the cost side and the revenue side, so we\u2019re seeing both of that. The good news is that the membership is running--the new membership, because obviously one of the things we\u2019re always focused on when you could grow 480,000 to 500,000 members, what are the members that you\u2019ve got? We\u2019ve been pleasantly, I guess happy to see that the utilization that we\u2019ve seen from those members are running in line or a bit better than expectations, so I would say it\u2019s a lot of the existing block that\u2019s really driving the outperformance on the cost side.","Gary Taylor","Thank you. Could we have just a little more color on the upside in the healthcare services EBITDA of 20 some-odd percent year-over-year? Are you seeing an acceleration of visits or something on the PBM side in terms of margins? Just a little more color on that, please.","Brian Cane","Sure. This is a business that we\u2019ve worked really hard in two regards. One is to drive trend benders for our retail and group segments, and I think they do a really great job of doing that. The other is to drive standalone EBITDA in the business, notwithstanding the fact that we\u2019re seeing lower utilization than forecast, and sometimes there are trade-offs there. ","I would say that the outperformance is pretty balanced across the board. Our pharmacy business is our largest driver of the segment, and it\u2019s running particularly, I would say, on certain areas running better, some areas running in line. But again, small changes there can have a meaningful impact just on the EBITDA.","Where we\u2019re seeing, I\u2019d say, greater percentage outperformance is on the Kindred side and on the Conviva side, where we\u2019ve spent a lot of time working to turn around that Conviva business and the numbers are better than what we had in our forecast, and the Kindred team is really executing on the business plan. I also mentioned that our care delivery organization outside Conviva, sort of our new clinics, are running less of a loss, I would say, than we expected, so that\u2019s been positive too. ","I would really say it\u2019s balanced contribution across the EBITDA race, which we\u2019re happy to see.","Gary Taylor","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of AJ Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","AJ Rice","Hi everybody. Maybe just following up first on that pharmacy question, your MA growth has more than offset, you pointed out in the release, the PDP decline. I guess I\u2019m just curious, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked you this, is an MA life in the pharmacy side equivalent to a PDP in terms of overall script utilization or utilization of mail order or anything else? Are they sort of equivalent or is an MA life better or worse than a PDP life?","Brian Cane","It\u2019s a fair question. It really depends on where that MA life is coming from - is it HMO, is it PPO, what geography is it in, because certain geographies use mail order less than others, just given some of our risk partners and the like. I would say unfortunately to your question, it really depends. That\u2019s probably not a satisfactory answer.","It also frankly depends on where the PDP growth comes from, so some of our plans have much lower mail order penetration that other PDP plans. I would say it depends, but obviously the extra MA growth relative to our expectations is helping our pharmacy business.","AJ Rice","Okay, and then I know it makes sense that you wouldn\u2019t want to comment on the individual MA yet, not knowing where other bids are, but I\u2019m assuming the group MA season is well along Can you just comment on what you\u2019re seeing there, what you\u2019re thinking heading into 2020 in that business line?","Brian Cane","Yes, we\u2019ve commented on this before. I would say we feel good about our group MA growth prospects. There aren\u2019t a host of accounts out there, but there are some, a few guys that we\u2019re chasing, and we feel good about some of the close ratios that we\u2019ve seen. I feel good about where our group MA growth is going to come in next year.","AJ Rice","Okay. You think you will see growth? ","Brian Cane","Yes, we definitely expect group MA growth next year, and I would say I feel good about that group MA growth. I\u2019m not prepared to give you a number, but we feel good about what we\u2019re seeing in the space and the accounts that we\u2019ve already won. We feel good about that.","AJ Rice","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","There are no questions at this time. Mr. Bruce Broussard, you may continue.","Bruce Broussard","Well, like every quarter, we really thank everyone\u2019s support and having confidence in the company and continuing to be a supporter, but these results that we reported today cannot be obtained without the strong support by our associates, the 50,000 people that come to work every day, so thanking them for their dedication to improving the health of individuals and making it much easier for them to engage in their health.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Humana Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Amy Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2018 results and our financial outlook for the full-year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts.","This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our second quarter 2018 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.","Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.96 for the second quarter of 2018 and raised our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $14.15, primarily reflecting continued strong Medicare Advantage results. Over the last year, we've continued to make significant advancements in our enterprise strategy particularly in the past few months as demonstrated by our recent investments in both Kindred at Home and Curo Health Services. With a continued focus on helping seniors achieve their best health, we are striving to reshape healthcare by expanding access to high quality value-based care in both primary care and home health. Driving quality and improved clinical outcomes remains a top priority as it is removing friction points by simplifying both the consumer and provider experiences through enhanced analytics.","As you will see from our results and key metrics that we haven't ceased our focus on the day-to-day activities that drives consumer engagement. In primary care, we've had a busy first half of 2018 with the launch of Conviva, the acquisition of Orlando-based Family Physicians Group and continued growth with Iora, Oak Street and other alliance primary care partners. We remain payer-agnostic and as an example are proud to be continuing to serve third-party customers of FPG.","This multifaceted approach to primary care enhances our ability to bring differentiated integrated care to more seniors more quick and gives us the flexibility to tailor our approach based on the differing needs of each local market. And as you know, last month, we announced a test and learn opportunity with Walgreens in Kansas City where we are co-locating our wholly-owned Partners in Primary Care clinics in two locations and co-creating with Walgreens health navigation services for seniors starting in five locations this fall.","Conviva manages the clinical operations in 110 staff model centers and also provides MSO services to more than 800 independent physicians in South Florida and Texas. Since announcing the creation of Conviva in February, the team has successfully combined the South Florida and Texas provider operations including MCCI, and created a new organizational structure aligned around the goals of improving quality outcomes by integrating care, and simplifying the patient experience.","In addition to managing the staff model centers and providing MSO services, Conviva is one of the largest physician practices in the South, employing over 400 clinicians and caring for approximately 200,000 Medicare Advantage patients. Conviva is a physician-centric organization that is self-governed and clinically autonomous. This group is driving cultural change through peer-to-peer accountability and reviving entrepreneurial spirit.","Physician retention, recruitment, and patient quality measures are all trending in the positive direction. Over the next 12 months to 18 months, we will rebrand the staff model clinics as Conviva care centers.","We're always looking for partners to work with us to advance our strategy and are routinely engaged in discussions with a variety of potential partners. The collaboration with Walgreens in Kansas City is evidence of our commitment to advancing integrated care. This collaboration will establish a senior focus, neighborhood based approach to health, creating unique integration among the primary care physician, the pharmacist, and a health plan navigator under one roof.","The two in-store clinics will be complemented by health navigation services offered in multiple Walgreens stores in Kansas City, expanding our reach in the community. They will be staffed with Humana employees who will be available to serve both Humana members and any customer who comes into the store.","The staff will help customers navigate their personal health journeys including basic health information such as one-on-one education sessions on chronic health conditions and answers to simple questions like how to change your batteries in a monitor (7:32); or identifying local resources to support customers' holistic health needs including access to healthy food, grief counseling groups, transportation, and translation services; or helping finding assistance with financing their health needs, including, for example, counseling and support to switch to lower cost alternatives. In addition, they will offer special services for Humana members who need help with their Medicare Advantage or prescription drug plans, including finding local specialists, understanding bills and resolving customer service issues.","With Walgreens, we also extend this integration through an omni-channel approach, including robust digital enhancement \u2013 engagement with the goal of increasing transparency, reducing friction in the experience and driving improved health. The partnership with Walgreens will allow us to test a retail strategy with a highly efficient capital investment. As we learned from this partnership, we could look to expand our collaboration into other markets over time.","Turning to Home, we recently announced the completion of the acquisition of a 40% interest in each of Kindred at Home and Curo Health Services, collectively the largest home health and hospice operator in the nation. As we previously indicated, we are striving to do something that has never been done before in home health, transform the payment model into one that is value-based, encouraging a transition from a maximizing volume to focusing on health and managing chronic conditions such as COPD, congestive heart failure and diabetes to prevent or slow disease progression.","This movement to value-based care and away from a predominantly therapy-based model is aligned with the recent CMS proposal for changes to the home health payment methodology, which was anticipated when we entered into the transaction. In that regard, we appreciate the model proposed by CMS and welcome change that aligns home health with pay-for-value and improved clinical outcomes, reducing preventable events.","While the ultimate transformation will take many years, upon closing of the transaction we immediately launched test-and-learn pilots aimed at both operationally and clinical improvements in four markets: Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Dallas, Texas. These pilots incorporate a pay-for-value mechanism in addition to the traditional fee-for-service payment based on four quality measures: hospital admissions; hospital readmissions within 30 days; emergency room visits without hospitalization; and timely initiation of home care, specifically within 48 hours of referral or an MD order.","In addition in order to create a differentiated home health model, we have the opportunity to reap the richness of Humana at Home telephonic and at home engagements as well as Humana Pharmacy resources into the skilled nursing provided by Kindred at Home clinicians.","Over the next year, we plan to leverage Humana predictive modeling to identify additional clinical interventions, integrate Humana Pharmacy resources to conduct comprehensive medication reviews and extend our care management best practices from Humana at Home into the Kindred at Home homecare environment. We will also reduce friction in the authorization process to ensure Kindred professionals are in the home within 48 hours of a referral or supplement the ordering physician through telehealth with a virtual MD to expedite the delivery of care.","We expect the changes we are making in the home health space will not only benefit our Medicare Advantage members, but also our Medicaid members over time. The continued development of our in-home capabilities together with our demonstrated clinical capabilities in Medicare Advantage uniquely position us to serve the Medicaid population, giving us confidence that we'll be successful in growing our Medicare platform through procurements.","Under our recent statewide award in Florida, we expect to serve an additional 141,000 members, an increase of 44% from our existing Medicaid membership. The Florida contract was awarded based upon the ability of plans to achieve the Medicaid agency's goals. These goals included creating enhanced provider and member experience, the ability to reduce preventable inpatient and outpatient events, high quality scores, innovative and effective methods to deliver integrated care and integration with the community in support of Medicaid beneficiaries.","We've been successful in achieving strong results across these areas by leveraging the capabilities that have positioned us as a top Medicare Advantage plan including our capabilities in chronic condition management, integrated care delivery, value-based provider relationships, and community programs designed to address social determinants of health such as food insecurity and social isolation.","While we are confident in our capabilities and expect to be successful in the procurement process consistent with our previous remarks, we will continue to assess length of time to scale and potential barriers to entry at the state level while considering potential M&A opportunities in the Medicaid space.","Before turning the call over to Brian, I'd like to touch on 2019 Medicare Advantage bids. As you know, the bid process is not yet final and accordingly, I will keep my remarks brief. The positive Rate Notice from CMS as well as the health insurer fee moratorium for 2019, among other factors, allow us to offer compelling products to our members for the 2019 benefit year. Nearly all of our members have stable or enhanced benefits.","In addition, we've continued our broker outreach to cultivate an excitement about our products and processes in the broker community. This year, we've rolled out significantly improved agent assistance and enrollment tools in one of the largest broker experience enhancement cycles we have ever undertaken. We look forward to further discussion on our third quarter earnings call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $3.96 for the second quarter, ahead of our previous expectations. We continue to see favorable medical utilization trends particularly in our Retail segment. To reflect this better than expected utilization, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $14.15 from our previous guidance of $13.70 to $14.10. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to approximate 31% of the full year number.","I will now comment on our individual segment level performance. In Retail, led by individual Medicare Advantage, we are seeing inpatient admissions as well as pharmacy utilization running better than our previous expectations, partially offset by higher than expected outpatient utilizations \u2013 utilization as members transition from the inpatient to outpatient setting for some of their care. Specifically, we are witnessing a notable decline in inpatient admissions relative to both last year as well as our initial expectations.","Consistent with the early indicators we saw last quarter, this inpatient admission favorability is resulting in a higher cost per inpatient admission as the lower acuity procedures are moving to the outpatient setting or are classified as lower cost outpatient observations.","Importantly, a major operational focus of the company has been to ensure that a member who is in the hospital setting is appropriately classified. And as such, we have seen a significant increase in lower cost observations versus higher cost inpatient admissions. We continue to work with our hospital partners to ensure appropriate reimbursement for any procedure undertaken. Additionally, CMS' removal of certain procedures from the protected inpatient-only list such as knee replacement surgeries has also caused a movement from the inpatient to the lower cost outpatient setting.","In summary, while it's still early with Medicare Advantage claims data only effectively complete through the first quarter at this point in the year, we feel good about the overall medical utilization trends we are experiencing, but have carried only a portion of that favorability through to the rest of the year in our guidance. Accordingly, we raised our full year Retail segment pre-tax income guidance to a range of $1.525 billion to $1.675 billion from a range of $1.45 billion to $1.61 billion and lowered our benefit ratio to a range of 85.1% to 86% from our previous guidance range of 85.2% to 86.2%.","Turning to Group and Specialty, the segment continues to perform well overall. We raised our revenue guidance by approximately $100 million to reflect higher sales of our profitable level funded ASO small group, as well as individual dental specialty products with TRICARE results also outperforming, particularly as a result of higher than expected positive final settlements from the prior contract. This was offset in the quarter by the performance of our community rated small group fully insured product as a result of the 2017 risk adjustment true-up, which I will discuss shortly.","We remain comfortably within our expectations around core health trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points and our pre-tax income guidance remains unchanged for the year. While healthcare trend remains well controlled, the second quarter medical benefit ratio is higher than last year's as expected. This is due to more seasonality in this year's quarter, lower PPD, which we saw come disproportionately in the first quarter of this year versus last, and the migration of healthier small groups from small group fully insured plans to level funded ASO products in 2018.","Our level funded ASO products are appealing to healthier groups, who prefer to avoid the higher priced community rated pool and this also provides a more predictable profit stream for us. In fact, over the last 18 months, we have seen over 58,000 members move from small group fully insured products to level funded ASO products. This bifurcation of the membership leaves the less healthy groups in the fully insured block negatively impacting that benefit ratio.","In addition, as mentioned previously, the second quarter 2018 reflects the impact of a change in estimate related to commercial risk adjustment as a result of the final risk adjustment notice received in June of this year for the 2017 coverage year. Our 2017 risk adjustment payment was approximately $20 million unfavorable relative to our expectation and this also impacted the 2018 accrual.","It is important to note that while the amounts are immaterial for the segment and especially to the company overall, because small group comprises a disproportionate amount of the premium in this segment given the relatively lower amount of large group business that Humana has any change in risk adjustment results in a more meaningful benefit ratio impact than otherwise would be expected. This new estimate for commercial risk adjustment coupled with the impact of certain reinsurance agreements we entered into during the quarter resulted in an 80 basis point increase in our Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio for the full year to a range of 78.3% to 78.8%.","As I will discuss further later in my remarks in connection with the expected sale of our closed long-term care business, we entered into a series of reinsurance agreements to fully cede our Workplace Voluntary Benefit and Financial Protection Products. These reinsurance transactions have a de minimis impact on pre-tax for the back half of the year but disproportionately impact the benefit ratio because these products carry a very low benefit ratio and higher admin ratio.","Shifting to the Healthcare Services segment, our performance this quarter was consistent with prior expectations. The provider in clinical businesses are performing largely as expected. On the pharmacy side, we are experiencing lower than anticipated utilization overall consistent with our discussion in the Retail segment. However, this lower utilization has been offset by higher than anticipated mail order penetration specifically in our Medicare Advantage business resulting in overall pharmacy results in line with our prior expectations.","We are however making a change to how we present the Healthcare Services segment to our investors to enhance transparency into our results. First, our previous segment pre-tax income guidance include the pre-tax results of Kindred at Home. As we approach the July closing of the transaction, we determined that the most appropriate way to show Kindred was to break it out separately and show the after tax Kindred results which will be consistent with what is shown on the face of our income statement.","Accordingly, we removed the Kindred results from our pre-tax income guidance for the segment and are therefore now guiding to full year 2018 Healthcare Services pre-tax segment earnings of $800 million to $850 million excluding Kindred as compared to our previous guidance of $825 million to $875 million including Kindred. Second, as we continue to expand and evolve the Healthcare Services segment businesses, we have concluded that the most appropriate way to measure and discuss the financial performance of these businesses is through adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA rather than pre-tax income.","The recent acquisitions of Kindred at Home and Curo Health Services together with the company's evolving care delivery model and the creation of Conviva result in higher levels of amortization, depreciation and interest expense that distort and mask the true performance of the underlying businesses when assessed on a pre-tax basis. Further, we believe that adjusted EBITDA is the relevant measure used to value and assess performance for other services businesses in the industry.","As a result, we are transitioning our financial reporting for Healthcare Services to focus on adjusted EBITDA performance moving forward. In our earnings press release, we included a bridge between pre-tax income and adjusted EBITDA. Our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance is approximately $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion which includes 40% of Kindred at Home's expected EBITDA in the second half of the year which corresponds to our ownership stake in the company. Specifically, we have added back $225 million of segment depreciation and amortization as well as the 40% of Kindred's second half EBITDA to a pre-tax guidance to arrive at our adjusted EBITDA guidance. Beginning with our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call, our intent is to provide Healthcare Services guidance on an adjusted EBITDA basis only.","I will now turn to an update on our long-term care sales process. We are very pleased to report that we have made substantial progress towards receiving the State Departments of insurance approvals necessary to complete the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, KMG America Corporation, which includes our closed block of non-strategic commercial long-term care insurance policies to Continental General Insurance Company.","Accordingly, during the second quarter, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the expected sale of $790 million including transaction costs and recorded an associated deferred tax benefit of $430 million for a net impact of $2.59. Importantly, this tax benefit will result in meaningful cash savings to the company and is greater than the sum total of the statutory capital and negative purchase price transferred to the buyer.","We also classify KMG as held-for-sale and aggregated its assets and liabilities separately on the balance sheet at June 30, 2018. The loss on the expected sale of the non-strategic closed block has been excluded from our adjusted earnings.","In addition, in connection with the expected KMG divestiture, during the second quarter, we entered into a series of reinsurance agreements to fully cede our Workplace Voluntary Benefit and financial protection products to ManhattanLife Assurance Company of America. These products were previously reported as supplemental benefit offerings in the Group and Specialty segment and are expected to result in a reduction in our specialty membership of approximately 450,000 members for the full year, approximately 430,000, of which were ceded during the second quarter.","In addition, in connection with the reinsurance transactions, we expect to transfer a total of approximately $245 million of subsidiary cash along with the related reserves to ManhattanLife, $230 million of which was transferred during the second quarter of 2018. This transfer of cash had no impact on cash and short-term investments held at the parent company. These reinsurance transactions did, however, result in the transfer of cash being classified as an operating cash outflow that was not previously contemplated in our operating cash flow guidance.","However, we only reduced our operating cash flow guidance for the year and at December 31, 2018 by approximately $100 million to $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion reflecting the outperformance of our business. Needless to say once these transactions are completed, we will no longer have any balance sheet, income statement, or cash flow exposure to these non-core businesses.","With regard to capital deployment activity more broadly as expected, subsidiary dividends paid to the parent in the second quarter were approximately $1.95 billion. This represents an increase of over $500 million from what we received for the full year 2017, primarily reflecting higher regulated subsidiary earnings in 2017 relative to 2016. Additionally, in July, we completed the Kindred and Curo transactions utilizing approximately $1.1 billion in parent cash on a combined basis.","Before I close, I would like to echo Bruce's comments regarding what we believe are our compelling Medicare Advantage product offerings for 2019 and reiterate our intent to drive meaningful EPS growth of a new baseline of $14.15 in excess of our long-term target of 11% to 15%.","I will now briefly discuss our 2019 headwinds and tailwinds. As far as headwinds are concerned, we expect that our PDP membership will decline given the competitive nature of the industry and the price discipline we are employing. This has the impact of constraining the growth of our pharmacy business, which will therefore rely on Medicare Advantage membership growth and improved productivity to fuel its results.","We also expect lower TRICARE profits in our Group and Specialty segment given that the positive final settlements received in 2018 associated with the previous TRICARE contract will not recur in 2019.","Our 2019 tailwinds, which are significant, include the positive Medicare Rate Notice, the HIF moratorium, the continued solitary impacts of tax reform, our incremental membership from the statewide Florida Medicare -- Medicaid contract award and our general Medicare business momentum. In addition, we expect reasonable adjusted EBITDA growth in our Healthcare Services segment as the Kindred results are annualized and our other businesses in the segment particularly our owned clinics improve.","With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I guess maybe just following up on that 2019 commentary there, I mean if you could just provide a little more color to what you've already provided around how you thought about 2019 bids as far as thinking about getting to that target margin versus growing membership.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So as we've said, we've continually taken a balanced approach to growth and margin. We've said very clearly and we'll reiterate today that we're going to make meaningful progress on our margin targets towards our target of 4.5% to 5% on a pre-tax basis. We won't get there next year, but as I said, we will make meaningful progress. But we also believe we put a compelling product out on the street. We believe our -- both our internal and external broker sales force are excited about the products that we plan to offer. And we feel good about our growth prospects for 2019.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Can I just follow up on that because I guess every company is talking about some of the same tailwinds as far as good rate update and HIF going away. And so it seems like everyone's talking as if everyone's going to grow above average next year. I mean how do you think about what differentiates what you're able to put out in the product into the market versus what everyone else is doing. Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Well, I understand that it is obviously a competitive marketplace and people want to grow. This is a very attractive segment. We have a lot of capabilities in this area that we've articulated many times in terms of our clinical programs and capabilities that allow us to offer we think a very compelling product to our members. And our members are going to see reduced premiums. They're going to see lower maximum out of pockets. They're going to see better co-pays.","I think the product that we're putting out on the street is going to be compelling and we'll see obviously where the competition comes in. We don't really have clear visibility on that yet but we feel good about that. But I would also echo what Bruce said in his remarks which is the work that our Medicare team has done with the broker community. We have made this a real focus of ours. I think we took a step back during the transaction with Aetna but I think we've really made up that in a very material way both in terms of the tools that we provided we've really invested in those, as Bruce has said. I think the product, as I said, that we're putting out for them to sell is going to be very compelling. And also the relationships that our team has developed with these brokers is very strong. Bruce and I also spent a lot of time with them and I'll tell you that they are very excited about Humana. And so we're looking forward to the open enrollment process.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Brian, thanks for all the color on the 2019 headwinds. I just want to prod you for a little bit more. So the -- I think the simple math here is that the HIF improvement or the HIF dropping to the bottom line in terms of the way you did it in 2017 that you're now going to run rate plus meaningful Medicare Advantage margin improvement is give or take $3 of earnings power which would put you around consensus of 2018.","So you gave us a lot of headwinds\/tailwinds for 2019 in terms of the core business which again were really helpful. Can you give us any thoughts on how that you think they net out in terms of the core if we just remove HIF and Medicare in the individual MA margin improvement? Do you think core actually grow next year? Or do you think the headwinds kind of offset -- will offset the core growth?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, I -- good morning, Justin, I'd rather not parse out all the details. I would tell you that the core business is strong and is growing. We're going to see just continued financial improvement in the core business from a margin perspective. Obviously, there's a lot that goes into the mix. As you said, there's the pre-tax impact of the HIF, there's the Rate Notice as you mentioned. But we've also, I think, offered compelling benefits.","And so we've had to also assume certain productivity assumptions as well as trend bender assumptions to make a compelling product and as well as grow margin.","So again, it's hard to parse out what the impacts of the HIF are, the Rate Notice, whatever it is. But all in, we expect a very robust 2019 for all the reasons that I laid out. We're excited about where we stand and how we're positioned for 2019.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, just the first is with the significant investment in sort of home based care as a major differentiator for you. I'm curious how you think about the future. And it sounds like today it's focused on kind of post-acute care. But where can that level of acuity end up in the home?","Can you sort of avoid primary or specialty or even acute care cost by bringing that in home. And then the second question is just around the Walgreens test phase of the Kansas City initiatives. What's the timing around that? And when do you think you'll have results to sort of better understand what a more retail focused strategy should look like?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, Justin. On the home side we're -- it's going to evolve -- I'm sorry not Justin, Josh. Thank you. Sorry about that, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","No worry, Bruce.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","But anyway, on the home side, we're taking it on a step basis. We do believe long-term the home is going to continue to see more and more acute oriented services for the primary reason of the telemedicine. We think the combination of telehealth in a physician office whether it's a specialty practice or a primary care practice with the combination of a nurse going into the home with proper devices will offer a full-fledged physician interaction that will be assisted for a senior or a member with chronic conditions. And we believe that that allows a lot of both convenience, but at the same time a lot of ability to get to people today whether it's in a rural setting or a particular setting that someone does not have transportation to go to a physician office.","The second part of that is also we believe over time that there are some business models out there today that allow you to have a ER doctor that can be mobile with a nurse that will allow you to focus on the higher acuity, more chronic patients and prevent ER visits as you are able to monitor through remote-monitoring and in addition through deeper analytics to be able to get to the individuals that require a much more intensive, more emergency oriented care. So we believe the combination of those two remote-monitoring, telehealth with the combination of a nurse in the home makes a great combination to raise the acuity that can be treated into the home.","In regards to Walgreens, and when will we start to see results, I think there's multiple. It's going to be a few years to see the ultimate outcome of that. We will see early on the response for both our membership growth in that marketplace, our ability to service our existing members in the marketplace and the convenience we provide through improved Net Promoter Score.","As time progresses, we will then be able to see the impact on both the health outcomes, Star ratings as a result of being much more proactive with HEDIS measurements. And then in the longer run what we hope to see is a combination of both growth but also the impact on larger health outcomes there. So it's sort of staged, I would say early on. It's just the receptivity of the market and how people will look at it. The second step will be more short-term clinical interactions that we have. And then third is more health outcomes oriented. And I would say, it's probably going to take a few years to see that fully through. But we will promise that we will provide updates to our investors on how that's progressing because we find it to be an exciting opportunity for us and Walgreens in being able to bring them a convenient setting to our customers in a much more capital efficient way and the ability to use the community presence of both organizations to complement and really bring up a very, very effective and convenient model to the marketplace.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. I just \u2013 is there anything that you've been able to glean from the environment about the nature of the competitive offerings that you think you'll be facing in the upcoming open enrollment season for Medicare Advantage in particular?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I would just say, Matt, really I mean, there's a lot of rumors out there, and I think as Kevin articulated at the outset that it does seem to be -- it will be a competitive marketplace and from a price point of view. And I think that's how we would probably say that it's going to be competitive in some ways market dependent. So we'll see, I guess, in about 45 days to 60 days of what comes out there.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. So the timing is the same for you as it is for us, the October 1?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Got it.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And why don't you -- if you find out something earlier, Matt, let us know.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, I'm just going to spread rumors for now.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Okay.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Let me ask you one follow-up which is the \u2013 on the group MA business, do you have any particular outlook for this year? Do you expect more conversions than usual? Are there any big jumbos that might be moving that you have sight on?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I would say for \u2013 assuming as we move into 2019, I would say that it's less of a robust pipeline than it was last year. So I wouldn't expect the same whatever was mid-teens growth this year as -- that we had this year that we'll have next year. So I think the pipeline there is a little bit less. I mean we have obviously a number of prospects that we're looking at and feel good about. We'll see where they shake out. We're sort of in the middle of that process right now and we also have organic growth in our existing accounts. But I wouldn't expect the same significant growth in group MA that we had for 2018.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Getting back to the strategy for 2019 around the health insurance fee, you talked about $1.80 of the health insurance fee being the non-tax deductible component of that which in 2017 you excluded that from earnings. So going to continue are you thinking about that $1.80 or if you talk about the Medicare portion of that, you maybe, call it, $175 million of upside. Is that something you're including when you're talking about not quite getting to your 4.5% to 5% Medicare margin target? Or is that on top of that when you think about that?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, I just want to make sure I understand your question. I mean the margin target we think about is on a pre-tax basis. So I guess the way I would say it is you can still generate nice margin improvement without getting to your pre-tax margin, but you have the additional tax benefit below the pre-tax line that you obviously benefit from an EPS perspective.","I would say that we're looking at it all the benefits together that we have the HIF pre and post tax, the Rate Notice, our trend benders, productivity, et cetera. Obviously, then have to overcome healthcare trend and then any benefit improvements that we want to make and so that all goes into the mix. But again, I wouldn't want to parse out one or the other because it's all in the stew for lack of a better word. But to a prior question, we do expect core improvement from a financial margin perspective in our products. And then obviously, there's a tax benefit that we're going to get as well.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So we should think about that $1.80 as being on top of anything else that you're targeting for your normal Medicare business?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, again, I'm just -- I'm hesitant to answer -- to say yes to that question only because it's all part of the mix. So we know we have that approximately $1.80 that's out there from a tax perspective as we think about planning for next year as we thought about the bids going into 2019. And so that was all part of the mix, but also part of the equation was, it's important to improve the pre-tax or core business performance as well. And so again, I can't parse it out for you and just say add $1.80. You could but that might not be the right answer because there could be a different pre-tax margin assumption.","Obviously, we didn't set our goals with that not in mind. In other words, it was in our mind as we thought about this as respect for 2020. So all these things were in our minds as we set our benefit design and our targets for 2019 -- our bid targets.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And Peter, just maybe add to that I know you're trying to get into the details of what happens on a per line basis. I do want to just to really communicate to the shareholders that we continue to be committed to growing our membership appropriately. And we continue to be committed to improving the efficiencies of the organization which will ultimately show up in the margin that we have.","As Brian is articulating, we put all that into the mix and calculate by market, how are we competitive in that marketplace as we think about how our competitors are going to respond and at the same time, how we want to look to improve the margin of our business there. And I know everyone wants to sort of say what we do line by line but it is, as Brian has well articulated, it fits in all one big pot. And we begin to start working what's best for our customers and what's best for our shareholders.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, everybody. Two part question on pharmacy. So I appreciate all the comments about what you're trying to do with Walgreens. Obviously, you had a very successful longstanding partnership with Walmart. I'm wondering, does this impact in any way what \u2013 I thought there was some discussion at one point about potentially expanding the Walmart activities. Is there \u2013 does this preclude anything further on the Walmart side? Can you maybe parse out a little bit your thinking about what one retail type of footprint versus another does for you? Is it just about getting more and more access points for your members?","And then if I could flip in there obviously as you formulate your pharmacy strategy there is this discussion out in Washington about all the changes to Part D potentially rebate, reform, other changes, how does that factor in and any comments on those?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Okay. On the specific on the retail side and partnerships, yeah, we still value and have a strong relationship with Walmart and continue to see that relationship both being what it is today and continuing to look at ways to expand that. We continue to believe that they and us serve very similar customers segments and working together. We both can serve the customers in a much more comprehensive way. And I would just continue to see us growing that relationship.","On the Walgreens side, they are a different retailer, more stores, smaller stores and more communities. And we see that also as being an opportunity to see how Walgreens retail model would work. You probably see smaller clinics in those particular stores. You'll probably see us have more navigational services in those stores versus something if we were to do something at Walmart, that's a much bigger footprint there. But I \u2013 but both of them are complementary and that competitive or being in that main one restricts us from doing the other. And we feel to serve our customers and their customers, there's great opportunity out there to do that.","I would say, one of the things that we are trying to do is to continue to test what our customers are looking for. We're trying to figure out what that sweet spot is and we feel that this is a great time for a test and learn and to understand it. And I think working with both retailers in that will fill the longer term view of how we modify this. And we won't get it right the first time, I'm sure and then we can evolve it over time. So I think I would look at this as more as a test and learn as a commitment to either party as a partnership there. And I think with -- all parties learn from this how best to serve the customer.","In regards to your question on the pharmacy rebate as you articulated, there's a lot of proposals coming in out of Washington. And as you well know, in the past, we don't try to comment on specific proposals. I think the question is, is if rebates are as a safe harbor what happens to that? I think overall, our belief is that if it does move to a point of sale kind of discount or point-of-service kind of discount that it will affect the other members, the majority of the members this is sort of the 80-20 rule. And we believe that Part D premiums will increase for our book of business. Obviously, I'm not speaking from the commercial perspective, but it will increase Part D premiums over time.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess just beating a dead horse here. But I was a little bit surprised to hear you won't hit the pre-tax margin target next year with the HIF suspension. And I guess as we're thinking about that, is it fair to say that you're sort of favoring enrollment growth over the near term profit? And maybe you can frame that with respect to comments you made in the past about growing EPS in 2020 over 2019 as well.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. I think we've said on multiple occasions that 2019 we wouldn't get back fully to our pre-tax margin target of 4.5% to 5%, but we would make material progress. We are looking to achieve a glide path there that over time, we will get back to that target. We're committed to that. We exceeded the target in 2017. You recall that in 2018 or this year, we're meaningfully below our target. And that's on account of multiple things, the biggest one being tax reform. We've invested a lot in the business, as we've talked about in prior occasions. And we also invested as we've mentioned some of the outperformance that we had in 2017 into 2018 benefit design so as to overcome the HIF and keep benefits relatively stable for our members.","So I think we've been pretty consistent on the fact that for 2019, we wouldn't get there on the pre-tax margin side but that we would continue to strike a balance to grow membership and margin. And that's what I believe that we've done. Obviously, we'll see what happens from a membership perspective as we get more information and we head into AEP. But we do feel good about how we're positioned and we'll see where it shakes out.","I think it's too early to comment on 2020. I know there's been a lot of questions about that and we're still not giving 2019 specific guidance. Obviously, the only thing I would say about 2020 is the HIF is obviously a very important element of that. I think we have demonstrated that that the HIF does impact member benefits and I think members will benefit meaningfully from the HIF being on moratorium for 2019. And we're hopeful that Congress decides to continue the moratorium on the HIF and we'll see where that goes. But obviously, that's going to be a pretty important part of the 2020 calculus year.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure. And I guess just so I understand it right there the ramp in profitability of a member, I guess the idea would be if you get better enrollment growth next year that provides a better glide path for the forward, yeah, outside that.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. There's no doubt about it. So just to refresh that when a member comes in, typically they're not very profitable. We don't assume real -- any real pre-tax margin in a new member and that's because they're not yet in our clinical programs and they're not typically risk adjusted appropriately for the conditions that they have. It obviously depends whether we get a member from a different plan or that member is new to Medicare in which case there's just a plain 10 (50:50), adjustment adjusted for age and sex and that's it.","But -- so that over time it takes several years to get that member up to profitability. But you are correct that as members -- as we grow more and as sort of the earlier members get to our target margins, we're able to generate very nice pre-tax growth. I would also remind you that, that it also impacts the Healthcare Services segment. So the more we grow membership, we also impact Healthcare Services. That's a really important element as well. So we're constantly trying to take the enterprise view and balanced growth and margin deliver top line growth but also nice EPS growth.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And I would like to just reemphasize that. I know you made a comment that we were biasing our self to membership growth. And I would say that our perspective as in 2017 and 2016 hasn't changed that we continue to balance margin improvement at the same time as we are also improving or growing our membership there. And as Brian articulated, the biggest thing that impacted our margin was specifically around the tax reform and taking pre-tax -- after-tax dollars and moving it up to the G&A line which doesn't show up in our margin base. And I would just say that that's probably the material change in any outlook that you have on our margin improvement.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Perfect. Helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Can you help a little more with the commentary around the lower utilization, but higher cost per claim on the inpatient and the higher outpatient trends? Maybe just frame the spend instead of utilization. That would be helpful. And then you talked about lower pharmacy claims. Just hoping you can flesh it out what you attribute that to or what you're seeing there. Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Ralph. I'm not -- there's really not a lot more color that I want to provide from my remarks which is just to say we've been very focused as an organization to make sure that the care is delivered in the appropriate setting; or in the event that there a member is at a hospital that that admission gets classified appropriately because if it's an observation rather than an admission which has several thousand dollar impact per episode, that's a material number. And so we've been very operationally focused. Our markets have done a wonderful job of ensuring that that sort of appropriate classification takes place. And so what's going to happen is what's left for your \u2013 in your inpatient numbers is a higher cost per admission just by definition because you're pulling out some of the lower cost outpatient procedures.","We're constantly monitoring our outpatient trend just to make sure we understand all the puts and takes as we are inpatient trend. We've been obviously very pleased with the inpatient trend. And we're hoping that that continues. And we're doing everything we can to manage trend as we always do.","On the pharmacy side, I wouldn't point to anything specifically. I think the specialty pipeline is not as robust I would say but really it's around traditional scripts that have been just a little bit better than we forecast. And I wouldn't say it's very material but on the margin, it obviously helps. But I wouldn't think -- I wouldn't say there's a wholesale change in anything that's occurring but it's been a positive boost for our Retail segment.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Just on the first part though just so I'm clear. I guess what I'm looking at is or thinking about is inpatient to outpatient. When you think of it just even just last year whatever trend was not utilization, but overall spend. Are you seeing inpatient spend higher year-over-year versus what you're seeing on the outpatient even just directionally?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. I mean -- so as I said in my remarks, our actual inpatient admissions are down but there are some unit cost issues which I just articulated. So overall, I would say overall utilizations on the inpatient side is probably slightly up, but nothing -- certainly it's a positive relative to our expectations because of the admissions number. And I think the acuity element effectively falls out of the -- of what's left. But again, I'm saying per admission as opposed to overall spend. Overall spend is better than we expected obviously that's why we have these benefits that we're talking about.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Fair enough. Okay. Thank you.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. If I can ask just one more question on the inpatient to outpatient move you talked about procedures coming off the inpatient-only list. Are you seeing members choose to do things like total knees outpatient? Or is it something where you're encouraging appropriate members to look at that as an alternate side?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","It's a little bit of both. I mean I think the outpatient setting is sort of an attractive place, I guess for lack of a better word, to have that procedure if it can be done. And so I think both sides of the equation including the physicians, I think. When it can be done in an outpatient setting, that can be a preferred setting to have that procedure undertaken.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then as you think longer-term, how do you think about the opportunity for deeper penetration of your existing members? Is the outpatient appropriate settings for those types of procedures versus an expansion of the number of procedures that are taken off the inpatient-only list. Do you see growth in both areas?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. I mean our general sense is that you're going to see more and more movement to the outpatient setting. And so I think that's sort of what we're planning for as we think about sort of our overall service category mixes and trend assumptions. Our assumption is that's going to continue over time. There's going to be just a continuing movement out of the hospital into the outpatient setting.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Going back to Kindred and Curo and understanding those are investments not full acquisitions. So integration maybe is not the right word. But how do you think about optimizing or harmonizing your workflow between those entities and your internal home health initiatives to drive more cost savings for the member base? I'm just thinking about what could manifest as a trend bender as we think into 2019 and what has to happen to make that a reality.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. Well, at the time of close and pre close we had a lot of planning of what would be our top priorities in engaging with Kindred. And they really are wrapped around a few things. First is, we're going to test and learn in a number of markets and be able to really focus more on not just about in bringing our home health business over to Kindred but more importantly bringing the ability to prevent preventable events from happening. And so we have a number of things going on that are focused more on nursing oriented patients that have chronic conditions that can be managed in the home. So first, we're just rerouting more effort into the nursing area as opposed to the therapy area. And so that's the first thing.","And as you mentioned, the trend bender out of this is reduced admissions, readmission rates going down. ER visits going down. And that's sort of our measurement of success there by focusing on these chronic conditions. Part of that test will also be is how do we bring telehealth into the home. And the telehealth platform will not only allow us to be more convenient in bringing care into the home but the second thing is it also will help us with our Star scores and other preventative measurements that allow -- that we can get into the home quicker both in being able to do it more convenient as a result of not having to get people transported there and in addition working through the appointment schedule. So we see two combinations here in our test and learn. One is around, how do we reduce the preventable events from happening; and then secondarily how do we continue to increase our performance on our quality measurements.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. In the past, you've achieved half of your growth from third party MA sales and maybe that took a hit during the deal speculation times, but then you invested in some tools and leads. So are you back to seeing a similar contribution about half of retail sales from third-party salespeople? Or is that more of a multiyear recovery of the distribution pipeline?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","No, I think that's right. It's actually a little bit more than half and we expect that to continue. In fact, what we've seen this year is the broker channel in 2018 outperformed a little bit our expectations which is a good thing. But I would expect sort of a little -- call it, a little over 50% will continue from the broker channel. And obviously, we hope -- both channels outperformed this year, so the proportions will remain the same. But as we said we feel very good about frankly both channels. And as you mentioned, we have invested a lot in the broker channel to make it easy to work with Humana.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And just to clarify an earlier comment on group MLR. The pressure came from small group commercial, not group MA. So group MA MLR is still in line with your expectation. Is that correct?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Correct. Yeah, group MA is actually in the Retail segment. It's not on the commercial side, yes.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Question following up on the neighborhood care model. And you talked about Iora and Oak Street, Walgreens and some solo clinics that you're doing in the retail setting in a test and learn mode. But at some point, once you're done with test and learn, as you think about the timing and the pace of the build-out, the scalability, the investments that are involved at your size relative to doing it in a JV with shared economics, data integration and so on, do you still see this as being a clash of different approaches and open architecture? Or might you give up the control and the flexibility for faster build-out and economics?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, Ana. We continue to see success in a number of markets and we're building those out at a pretty good pace, I would say, as fast as our partners can digest them. And that would be in places like Iora and Oak Street would be two good examples of that. And we continue to look at that as being successful in certain markets there. We are -- and similar to our relationship with Iora and Oak Street, a number of years ago, we sort of went through a test and learn to see if that worked and that seems to work. Walgreens is sort of in that state of maturity and there's -- and our Partners in Primary Care is in that state.","I do believe over time you'll continue to see the company increase its intensity in opening these clinics whether it's with partnerships or a wholly-owned model like we have with Partners in Primary Care and as we own a significant part of Conviva in South Florida there.","But I would say today, we're not convinced that the primary care model is completely figured out. And having flexibility to deal with it in the local market, have flexibility to deal with the changing consumer expectation and at the same time be able to do it in a capital efficient way is what you see us trying to do here. And you see more intensity on it. I think if you were to go back and look at our calls with our investors in our one-on-one, it becomes more of the communication and discussion. But it still is an immature stage and we want to learn that immaturity as opposed to taking big bets today.","But I will -- to answer your specific question, I would say that the intensity of it will increase and our commitment of putting more and more in a faster way and scalable way will increase over the next 24 months or so.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes so my follow-up, I think that makes sense, I guess, given its immature. But if you take a step back, and you've talked a lot about the neighborhood care model. I think I'm hearing a little bit more about telehealth in the home setting. But as you think about your core customer base with seniors, would your focus be more on a bricks-and-mortar care model or more on a digital care model as newer seniors age into Medicare and then over time in late stage Medicare you're confined to a home or a nursing home?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","That's an interesting question because as we are seeing there are different stages of aging and those different stages are requiring different kind of interactions. We see an earlier stage individual to be much more virtual and much more preventative and in result probably less dependent on the healthcare centralized system and more on access points outside of that.","As they age, we see that they are requiring more intense services at a more frequent time and the combination of home in the home, combination of remote monitoring and then the combination of having specialty care whether it's in the healthcare setting or at home is an important part of that. And what we're trying to develop is not one or the other. It's the integration of that to accommodate people both in their needs today and as their needs mature.","So I wouldn't say it's either or I would say it's an integrated approach. And that's what you probably see more than anything is that we're building these capabilities home primary care. You see us -- the telehealth, we haven't talked much about behavioral. But it's the integration of that and then having the ability to distribute that where the needs of the customer are at the time of their particular journey of health. And I don't want to say we're one over the other. I think it's a combination of all of them. And I think successful organizations will be the ones that integrate it together as opposed to just having one channel.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Very thoughtful. Thanks, Bruce.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. I want to hop back over to the healthcare segment maybe as a tie-in to Dave's question earlier. Certainly, I understand the strategy and the move for value-based models for Kindred at Home. But how do you really look -- think about balancing what might be a conflict between your majority partner who probably does better in a fee-for-service world and your own interest? So any color on your thoughts on how that would really play out would be appreciated. And then I have a follow-up?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. We recognize that conflict completely. Now a few things. As we entered the investment into Kindred at Home, we threw a lot of research within DC. We came to the conclusion that this -- the home model is going to evolve to be more and more nursing oriented and more and more around chronic conditions and the recent release of that highlights that. So we see a movement to more of our patient population as opposed to just therapy population. So I think that that's an important change.","The second thing in our relationship both in -- with our partner Kindred and our -- the investors in there that we've actually created an incentive for them to have more and more customers on -- I mean members on a value-based relationship that is paid on outcomes as opposed to just the volume themselves. And that really helps both the line interest and in addition helps us in being able to find the right areas for us to test and learn this with because we both are oriented to the same success here. But I do believe our partners invested in this believe that fee-for-service in the short run will continue to be an important part of the business as we do because we own 40% of the business. And we wouldn't want to compromise that business. But the partnership with Humana allows to reposition over time the strategic value of Kindred as a total organization as you think about the trends long-term in healthcare.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. And my second question, obviously, with the Curo acquisition you must like the hospice business. So my question is with hospice being carved out of the MA benefit today, what's your longer term view -- or actually short term and your longer term view there, any thoughts -- and also just any thoughts in the context of the future for value-based purchasing for hospice? Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yes. I think hospice for us is really we are -- we look at that as a service that we are participating and in providing to the healthcare community. But from a -- and we leave it ultimately up to the caregiver, the family and the physician to decide where is the proper place for an individual. But once they decide that, it moves from a restorative to pain management kind of treatment, then we are there to serve them and integrate that into the offerings we have. In regards to is it in or outside of Medicare Advantage, we really look at it as more is it the right thing to do for the family member and then ultimately be able to help them with that transition of a quality of life.","We do believe over time that hospice and palliative care will continue to be more and more important part of the care model as we see the need for it. We see people living longer. And at the same time treatment options at end of life become more -- whether more intense or there are fewer of them and people make this choice that is probably one of the less used areas of healthcare today that probably have a large positive impact on people's life as they think about where they are in their stages of life there. So for us, we are more a recipient of it. We are believers it's the right thing to do and we're a believer that we will provide that service to our members if they choose to. And the payment model is less of an issue for us and insignificant in our decision making.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of clarifications I just wanted to tie down. Brian, you've mentioned -- sorry, excuse me, lower TRICARE final settlements as a headwind heading into 2019. Can you give us a sense of what those were for 2017 and 2018?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","I'd rather not get into that level of detail. We know we don't provide that. I mean I obviously called it out because I think it'll impact particularly as you're modeling your Group and Specialty pre-tax for next year. There'll be some impact there. I think that will constrain the growth in the segment. But I'd rather not call it the specifics. We typically don't do that. That's okay.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then second question is on the group MLR guidance raise in terms of lifting that MLR, it looks like the $20 million of the risk adjustment represents about 30 basis points on the full year. So the other 80 basis points, are you increasing your own accruals for the rest of the year? Or is it the reinsurance? Or is it just some of the mix shift that you talked about in that segment?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. So a fair question. So, on the guidance specifically because the mix shift was anticipated, it's related to the reinsurance transaction. And yes, we also have accrued more, a bigger payable for 2018 on the back of 2017. So that's included in that MER increase.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. We will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Bruce Broussard for concluding remarks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Well, like always, we wouldn't be able to have the success we have without the 55,000 people that are part of our organization in every day helping our members to do that. So I'd like to thank each and every one of them for their dedication to the company.

Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this afternoon's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Finally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike McCallister.","Michael B. McCallister","Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Humana announced second quarter earnings of $2.16 per share, above our most recent guidance of $1.98 to $2.08 per share, primarily due to favorable prior-year claims development. We have accelerated the timing of our earnings release as recent developments have resulted in the lowering of our forecasted earnings for the full year.","Although 3 of our 4 business segments are running ahead of plan, the Retail Segment is experiencing some issues that we anticipate will be addressed over the coming quarters. We have consequently lowered our full year 2012 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.90 to $7.10 from the previous range of $7.38 to $7.58.","While we are disappointed by the need to adjust our earnings forecast, we believe that it is prudent given the developments that Jim Murray will describe in detail in a few moments. Bruce Broussard will then outline the measures underway to address these issues. Jim Bloem will close by relating these matters to our revised outlook for the year.","First, though, I want to reiterate that our strategy continues to be sound and represents a solid path towards long-term growth and earnings. Further, this strategy continues to provide returns in a number of ways. Let me briefly highlight each of the 5 elements of Humana's strategy. First, grow membership, especially in Medicare. As you know, our Medicare Advantage membership growth significantly exceeded expectations in 2011 and 2012. Though with that growth has come some short-term challenges, the long-term benefits of such growth across the enterprise are significant. Second, execute on our 15 Percent Solution. Over the past 5 years, the buildout of our efficient networks and the application of our clinical programs have driven sustained results. We're also excited about the positive impact we expect from both clinical analytics capabilities of our Anvita operations and the focus on homecare through the capabilities and services provided by our SeniorBridge team. We believe we're further enhancing our solid Medicare Advantage value proposition with these activities.","Third, expand geographically. Over the course of the past few years, we've dramatically expanded our provider networks, vastly increasing the number of people across the nation who have access to our product offerings.","Fourth, further develop integrated delivery system models. Our value-based delivery systems initiatives allow our provider partners to continue to progress along a continuum of pay for performance models, leading to increased engagement by both doctors and hospitals and improved health outcomes for members.","And finally, capture adjacent business opportunities. It's worth noting that we raised our expectations for 2012 earnings from our Health and Well-Being Services segment today, primarily as a result of the ongoing growth and success of our RightSource mail-order pharmacy business.","In closing, we continue to believe our company strategy is sound. We expect growth in membership will continue to be an important element of that strategy as will long-term growth in earnings. I'm confident that the steps we're taking to address our short-term issues will further enhance the growth we continue to anticipate over the coming years.","With that, since I know you're likely anxious to hear more about the short-term issues we're facing, turn I'll turn the call over to Jim Murray.","James E. Murray","Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Mike shared with you that the Retail Segment is experiencing some challenges. The full year shortfall to our prior guidance for the Retail Segment is expected to be approximately $260 million. This shortfall is related primarily to 2 issues with our individual Medicare Advantage book of business. First, a higher-than-planned benefit ratio on new members contributing about $170 million to the shortfall and second, higher-than-anticipated medical cost trends across all individual Medicare Advantage members contributing an additional $100 million.","In a moment, I'll elaborate on these 2 items but first, I'll provide a little context and background. As Mike noted in his remarks, growing Medicare Advantage membership is one of our key strategic objectives. It enables us to create economies of scale in our administrative cost structure, motivates and encourages providers to work collaboratively with us in the markets that we serve and allows synergistic growth in our other services. Another important contextual point is that benefit ratios for new members joining our Medicare Advantage plans are historically higher at the outset than those of our existing members due to the time it takes to properly document a member's risk profile and determine which members we believe will benefit from the clinical programs that comprise key elements of our 15 Perfect Solution. While we make some progress during the member's first year, it generally takes 12 to 24 months to fully recognize the benefit of all of these efforts. Once properly documented and in the appropriate clinical programs, new member benefit ratios approximate those of our existing members in similar products and markets. Bruce will describe the steps we are taking to accelerate this time frame, as well as illustrating how our new members have performed over time.","Detailing the $170 million new member pretax issue, this slide summarizes our new member cohorts for the last 4 years. From this slide, several observations are worth noting. First, we added significantly more new members in 2011 and '12, as compared to 2009 and '10. Second, our benefit ratios on new members added in both 2009 and '10 were lower than our new member benefit targets used in the related bid processes. Third, we raised our new member benefit ratio targets in 2011 and '12 and finally, the actual benefit ratio on 2011 and '12 new members is higher than the 2011 and '12 targets that we revised.","I'll begin with the significant new member growth in 2011 and '12. As shown on this slide, this growth resulted in approximately 30% of our overall average membership base having a benefit ratio than the existing base by as much as 500 to 700 basis points. While we had planned to grow in both 2011 and '12, we surpassed our new member growth targets by approximately 190% in 2011 and now anticipate exceeding our target by over 80% in 2012. The higher percentage of new members with higher benefit ratios compared to the existing member base has put pressure on our 15 Percent Solution to perform even better than it has in prior years.","Second, given the 2011 and 2012 CMS funding reductions, the confidence we have in the results from our 15 Percent Solution and our belief in the importance of growing Medicare Advantage membership, we were willing to increase our target new member benefit ratios in 2011 and '12 as shown on this slide. As we detailed in our first quarter call, we increased our overall target benefit ratio by reducing some of the conservatism we had historically used in our bid processes which had resulted in the favorable comparison of our actual benefit ratios to the related targets in 2009 and '10 that is also shown on the slide. The fact that we raised our new member target benefit ratio exacerbated the impact of the higher-than-anticipated new member growth that I noted earlier. It also reduced the likelihood that we would perform more favorably than our bids as it happened in 2009 and '10.","The root cause for the final additional new member issue has been more difficult to identify with the time that we've had. As we have discussed in previous quarters, the risk profiles for both our 2011 and '12 new members is very similar to our historical new member profiles as you can see noted on the slide. However, especially for the 2012 cohort of new members, utilization of medical service is higher-than-anticipated. One potential cause we are in the process of analyzing suggests that the 2012 age-in members may not have had access to prior coverages due to the difficult economy. And as a result, have some level of pent-up demand, which could ease over time. The benefit ratio for specifically the new age-in members is substantially higher than the overall average for the total new member cohort and that is particularly true in 2012. For the purposes of this discussion, age-ins are described as being new to the Medicare program regardless of age. The slide details the number of age-ins included in our new member cohorts by year. Again, this is only a potential cause that is currently under investigation and today's guidance adjustments does not assume any easing of this level of utilization over time.","To summarize the new member issue, the cumulative effect of all these items is that both our 2011 and '12 actual new member benefit ratios exceeded our increased targets again as is shown on the slide.","As we began our 2013 bid work in approximately February of 2012, we had already determined that we needed to make adjustments to address a series of factors before any issues related to 2012 came to life. These included but were not limited to some target geographies that were underperforming for us and the underperformance of the 2011 cohort of new members. In addition, we evaluated the overall competitive position of our benefits and premiums and concluded we have the opportunity to make the adjustments we had seen to that point without compromising our competitive position. As our bid work continued, we were also able to see some trend issues for 2012 new members begin to emerge. Although trend later grew to a higher level than we had previously experienced when we submitted our bids in early June, and together with the other developments we'll discuss today, now impacts our 2012 earnings guidance.","While the extent of the trend issues for the 2012 new members was not totally included in our 2013 bids, looking back, when you consider all the issues that we did address before the full extent of the 2012 new member trend occurred, I feel very comfortable that the 2013 bids will enable us to address the issues that I've reviewed here with you today. Bruce will give you a more detail of the expanded work that we did as a part of our 2013 bid process.","Turning now to the $100 million and higher-than-anticipated medical cost trends, this appears to be primarily from 2 items. First, as a part of the Affordable Care Act's new preventive benefits, CMS and Humana are messaging Medicare beneficiaries, encouraging them to seek wellness visits and physical exams. During the first half of 2012, wellness visits per 1,000 members have increased over 200% from the prior year and routine physicals are up 22% per 1,000 member year-over-year. In addition to the cost associated with these specific procedures, there also appears to be related increases in additional procedures that are likely identified in the initial wellness visit or exam. Although we were cognizant of these benefit changes and the related messaging, we did not expect the immediate and extensive utilization associated with them. However, we did make assumptions around this higher level of wellness benefit utilization in our 2013 bids. We expect to continue this messaging because we believe in the likely favorable impact this will have on future quality outcomes and costs.","Second, we are also seeing a modest spike in outpatient costs, which from reading many of the sell side analysts reports, corresponds to an increase in outpatient volumes being reported by some providers during the first half of 2012.","Now Bruce will review the corrective actions we have put into place to address the items that I've just detailed. He will also talk about steps we have taken to bolster our clinical infrastructure and enhance our overall ability to achieve further success with our 15 Percent Solution.","Bruce D. Broussard","Thanks, Jim. We are not pleased with the recent development and take these matters seriously. We are confident in our belief that overall bid strategy for 2013, combined with additional actions around our 15 Percent Solution, will allow us to reduce the benefit ratio through 2012 and to our target levels in 2013. I'll cover 3 main topics in my remarks. First, the detailed summary of our 2013 bid actions and their implications, investments in our clinical infrastructure; and our improved clinical process to enhance the 15 Percent Solution.","As Jim described in our 2013 bid process, we performed an exhaustive analysis of our product portfolio, the performance of our expansion markets and the competitive position of our premiums and benefits. Several important observations came from this analysis. We are confident that our pricing strategy and processes are sound. We found no material areas driving significant financial variation that gave us concern regarding individual or overall marketplace long-term stability and viability. We also noted that for many products in various markets, the economic value proposition we are providing our members has improved relative to our competitors.","As a result of our strong competitive product position, we had headroom to adjust the benefit package. As this slide demonstrates, we adjusted benefits for a significant number of members. However, supporting members' historical preferences, we have kept the premium increases to a minimum. We believe our approach and expected 2013 market competitive position allows the continuation of our Medicare Advantage growth, albeit likely to be below levels of 2011 and 2012.","As Jim outlined, we've incorporated in the 2013 bids more conservative assumptions, providing further comfort in meeting the 2013 benefit ratio. Overall, we feel the 2013 bid actions will reduce the benefit ratio to more normalized levels, complementing our bid actions can make significant progress in 2012 through our clinical programs. I'd like to share a few aspects of our 15 Percent Solution we feel will make an impact in the coming quarters.","Critical to the success of our clinical programs is the clinical infrastructure. As you can see from this slide, we have heavily invested into clinical nurses, which has produced a strong ROI over time. This investment is to increase our senior members' participation in our acute and chronic care programs. Specifically, I'd like to discuss our expansion of our chronic care programs. For years, Humana's has been developing its product care program referred to as Humana Cares. As has previously been explained, Humana Cares is a primary telephonic chronic care management program designed to assess all aspects of those seniors living with multiple chronic conditions. Actuarial studies have concluded that this program consistently delivers a 33% reduction of hospital admissions. Today, approximately 150,000 of 270,000 seniors with multiple chronic conditions are managed by Humana Cares.","The recently closed SeniorBridge acquisition enhances Humana Cares home care capabilities by introducing a field-based care manager targeting the highest 55% risk members having functional limitations. The field care managers focus on such things as medication organization and adherence, disease-based and nutrition counseling and home safety issues. These additional chronic home care capabilities are anticipated to further improve the reduction in hospital admissions by 50%. The combined program is expected to carry an ROI of 4:1.","Complementing the ROI from expanding our nurse infrastructure is the steps we are taking to address the timeliness and the identification of members for our clinical programs and ensuring adequate risk documentation. Through our Anvita clinical analytic capabilities, we've developed predictive models that utilize early member condition codes, pharmacy data and member specific consumer data to provide us with the reliable predictors that we believe will allow us to accelerate the identification of the high risk members by 6 months. We've also developed a revised health risk assessment, which now includes a more fulsome evaluation. Functionally challenged members are twice as likely to incur readmissions, and generally represent 3x the medical cost of other members. We are beginning these combined new processes in the third quarter of 2012.","To address the timeliness of enrollment in clinical and obtaining documentation to properly reflect a member's risk profile, we've developed and implemented predictive models to identify members who are likely to benefit from clinical intervention and also not being adequately documented. Members identified through this process are scheduled for a physician or a nurse practitioner home visit to perform a comprehensive wellness exam. This exam is designed to only -- not only assist the identification enrollment of members who could benefit from our clinical programs, but also to obtain proper condition documentation. During the last half of 2012, we estimate that 30,000 such visits will happen.","Based on our a actuarial analysis, we believe this new program will likely carry an overall return on investment of 8:1, which includes the beneficial effect of clinical program savings and additional documentation.","Enhancements to our clinical programs I've just described were designed to improve our ability to achieve our 15 Percent Solution and allow us to compete for the long-term. We believe the investments we are making during 2012, while costly, will position us well for the future. The combined 2012 spend for these clinical programs will beneficially affect 2013 results by $200 million to $300 million.","My final slide demonstrates how the combined 2009 and 2010 new member cohorts improve over time. The corrective actions and improved processes are expected not only to improve the slope of this line for our 2011 and 2012 new members, but also to ensure these new members achieve the benefit ratios similar to the existing block.","Mike spoke of the soundness of our company's strategy despite these challenges. I echo his comments and know that leaders and associates across Humana are engaged to put us back on track for the performance our shareholders have come to expect and what we demand from ourselves.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Bloem for a detailed explanation of our second quarter results and revised guidance.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good evening, everyone. Let's start a detailed review of both our second quarter results and revised 2012 full year guidance of $6.90 to $7.10 per share, by first looking at the second quarter by itself. Our reported second quarter earnings per share of $2.16 after adjustment for prior year favorable medical claims reserve development of $0.15 per share approached the $2.03 per share midpoint of our May 21 guidance. However, as we analyzed our June results, it became apparent that although we fell within the range of our second quarter forecast, we needed to lower our full year 2012 earnings per share guidance range.","So turning now to the full year, this slide displays the major changes from our previous second quarter and full year forecast to our revised full year guidance, including the significant changes for each of our business segments. As noted on the previous slide, we experienced $40 million of consolidated favorable prior-year medical claims development, which was comprised of $24 million in the Retail Segment, $12 million in the Employer Group Segment and $4 million in our other businesses, primarily Medicaid. For the rest of my remarks, I will elaborate on the remaining guidance changes by segment.","First, so now looking in detail at the Retail Segment, the attached slide highlights the key changes in both the quarter and full year. For the full year, you can see the $270 million reduction in our expected individual Medicare Advantage underwriting results. This is attributable to the new membership and increased claims cost, which Jim Murray and Bruce Broussard just described. In the second quarter, we were $91 million below the forecast for these same 2 items. Also detailed on the slide in the second quarter, we recognized $73 million of unfavorable claims development from the first quarter on our individual Medicare Advantage book. This trended to a corresponding additional $82 million of unfavorable impact on our second quarter results, totaling $155 million for the second quarter and yielding a $311 million increase in expected Medicare Advantage claims for the full year.","On the positive side, we also received updated risk adjustment payment information from CMS in early July. This resulted in a $41 million increase in our expected full year premiums per member. Combining the $311 million of expected increase in full year claims with a partially offsetting $41 million increase in full year premiums per member, yields a net individual Medicare Advantage shortfall of $270 million as shown and discussed.","This slide further indicates that the second quarter also benefited from $64 million of premium risk adjustments, as $23 million of our full year estimate occurred earlier in the year than we previously forecasted. Further, we have included $46 million for additional investments in the second half of the year. These investments primarily represents the steps we are taking to strengthen our clinical capabilities and the 15 Percent Solution, as Bruce just discussed.","Although we recognize that making these investments now will unfavorably impact our expected 2012 results, we concluded that making them is in the best interest of our members and shareholders, as we believe these investments will continue to position us to further improvement in our 15 Percent Solution.","Next, you can also see from the slide that our remaining Retail Segment operations are expected to improve by $32 million for the full year. This improvement is attributable, primarily to our PDP business, which continues to perform well.","Finally, with respect to this slide, we've also included the year-to-date and full year Retail Segment benefit ratios for both 2011 and 2012 at the bottom of the slide. This comparison shows that we now expect the full year to be 350 basis points higher than last year, while the year-to-date is up only 220 basis points. This in turn implies that we now expect the year-over-year spread to be larger in the second half of the year relative to the year-to-date and there are 2 reasons why this spread widening is occurring.","First, as we discussed last year, we experienced lower drug cost in the second half of 2011 as a result of both patent expirations and lower wholesale acquisition prices for several highly used generics. Accordingly, in the second half of 2012, there's no similar benefit in the year-over-year comparison. Second, in accordance with our long-standing practice, we've not included any prior year development in our forecast for the second half of 2012, whereas our second half of 2011 results included $75 million of favorable prior period development, which we disclosed with those results.","Turning now to the Employer Group Segment, we're pleased to be raising our guidance today by $60 million. This improvement is occurring, primarily in both our commercial group lines of business. With respect to commercial claims trends, we've consistently stated that we expect a gradual uptick in utilization at some point and accordingly, we've guided and more importantly, priced assuming the 6% to 6.5% secular trend in 2012, which is a 100 to 150 basis points increase over the 2011 secular trend of approximately 5%. Last quarter, we indicated that we're seeing full year secular trend in the Employer Group Segment move toward the low end of the 6.5% -- 6% to 6.5% range and now estimate that the full year will be around 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This level of trend still contemplates an uptick in the back half of the year as we have run below 6% for the first half of the year on our commercial products.","To further elaborate on commercial cost trends, we continue to see declining levels of inpatient hospital utilization in the negative low- to mid-single digits. However, this is accompanied by a shift to outpatient procedures without patient utilization trending slightly higher than last year but still in the low-single digits. Inpatient and outpatient hospital rates continue to be in the mid-single digits and we continue to see physician and prescription drug costs trending in the low- to mid-single digits.","So to summarize our commercial trend expectations, while we still expect a gradual uptick in commercial trends in the coming quarters, the pace of the uptick is slower than we anticipated in our pricing, and this is the primary reason for the $60 million increase in our pretax guidance for the Employer Group Segment.","Turning next to the Health and Well-Being Services segment, we also are pleased to be raising our guidance for the full year by $60 million, including operating over performance in the second quarter of $41 million. This operating over performance is primarily driven by RightSource, our mail-order prescription drug operation and can be primary attributed to 3 things. First, we've increased penetration into our membership base beyond our initial expectation. Currently, 23% of all prescription drugs dispensed in connection with all of our retail and Employer Group health plans are filled via RightSource. Second, we continue to improve our cost of goods sold by both leveraging our volumes and recontracting with suppliers. And third, we continue to lower our costs to fill through increasing scale and streamlining our operations.","Turning finally to our other businesses. Our second quarter results included a significant amount of legal fees associated with the previously announced settlement of the Sacred Heart litigation. The second half of the year is expected to be better, primarily due to an improved outlook for our military business.","To conclude, we recognize that we've shared a lot of information with you today and appreciate your patience during our prepared remarks. We're confident in our ability to successfully address these short-term Retail Segment challenges and resume our earnings growth.","With that, we will open our phone lines for questions, and we request that each caller ask only 2 questions in fairness to those still waiting in the queue. Operator, will you please introduce the first caller?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just ask a little bit more about your realization of the less favorable margins on MA relative to when you made your bids for next year. Can you give us sort of any sense of how much of that you caught? I know it wasn't all of it, but it was some of it. Did you see this sort of developing in May and then you caught half of it in your bids? I'm just trying to get a range of magnitude.","James E. Murray","Sure. This is Jim. Let me go through this very carefully so that you come away with the right impressions. As I said, we started our bid process in February of this past year. When we started that work, we were of the opinion that we wanted to do some things relative to some things that we had seen long before we started the bid process around some markets that we weren't performing as we hoped. We also saw, obviously, the 2011 new member issue. And we also, as a part of getting prepared for our bid process, studied where we were competitively in the markets that we serve. And we concluded that we had the opportunity to do some things to put back some of the profitability that existed at that point in time. And so what we did is we began the process during February and we went along and we saw claim data begin to develop for the month of April that we saw in early May. And we also saw May incurred claims that we saw in early June, which we were able to look at and evaluate and get into our overall 2013 bid work. Then in the beginning of June, we filed our bids. At that point, we felt very good about the bid work that we did. We also felt good that we were going to be able to make the entire year. During the early part of July, we summarized our June incurred claims and we spotted that we had some additional issues and some trends that were developing worse than we had imagined when we filed our bids. So it's that last part of the June incurred claims that we spotted in July that caused us the problems that we're talking about here today. But the point that I want to really make sure that everybody is clear on is that in addition to all the trend evaluation that we were seeing for the months of April and May, we had already begun to think about some things that we wanted to do when we started our work in February to address problem markets in some of what we saw for 2011. And so when I step back and I evaluate our entire bid process, I'm very comfortable that yes, I can say that we missed the June incur claims that we learned about in July. But I think more than offsetting that is the things that we wanted to address when we started the process in February. And so when you put all those pieces together, I feel very good about our 2013 bids and restoring a level of conservatism that didn't exist in 2012 and '11 like it did in 2009 and '10.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could just ask a follow up on what you're seeing from the age-ins. So I gather you're seeing more age-ins relative to the prior years, which is not surprising given the demographic bulge that's now coming through. Do you have any sort of updated estimate whether industry-wide or at least from what you could see from your numbers, that there's a higher take-up rate for these -- this first cohort of baby boomers turning 65 in the current economic environment?","James H. Bloem","The good news is that we're doing a better job of getting more share of the age-ins. The bad news is that the slide that we just reviewed with you in terms of the performance of the age-ins until you get them properly documented and get them into the right clinical programs.","Michael B. McCallister","The longer term good news is that they're going to be with us for about 7 years and you saw the slide that Bruce used. They improve quite dramatically relative quickly. And so this group will get better and they're going to be with us for a long time, so they will become a productive part of the group.","James H. Bloem","And on top of that, I think it also gives an indication that there will possibly be more growth in Medicare Advantage as a percentage of the total Medicare system as a whole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick follow up there. So, Jim, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're indicating that not only do you think you got your 2013 bids back to a target margin, but that you also think you got your 2013 bids on Medicare Advantage back to a relative level of conservatism that is closer to what you had in 2010, 2011?","James H. Bloem","That's correct.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if I could just ask a question. I mean, you only a couple of weeks ago reaffirmed guidance, I believe at a conference. If you're seeing all this, so you saw everything that you're indicating that was significant enough but you bid for significant benefit design changes, it sounds like. What makes you comfortable in the reaffirming guidance at that point?","James E. Murray","As Jim shared with you, there were a number of offsetting issues up through the June payment month that offset some of the issues that we described here today. It was when we saw the June incurred claims develop themselves in the month of July that we had to step back and say it didn't look like the whole year was going to be on our guidance. And at that point, we began to evaluate some of the things that we've talked about, particularly the one that's frustrating to me is not knowing about the 2012 new member cohort and what's causing the increased utilization and we'll continue to evaluate what that's all about. But it wasn't until the June incurred month payments that we got a good look at in July that we concluded that we weren't able to continue with our guidance and that's...","James H. Bloem","That's why we're here today, a week early.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right. Okay. So my follow-up to that would just be in terms of -- is it fair to think -- I'm just trying to walk through the logic. Is it fair to think that at that point, up until then, you only expected this to be some kind of a short-term blip? You did not think it was a continuing issue that you thought was going to repeat in July, August, September? And if that's the case, why would you have built it into your bids at the level that you're saying you did?","James E. Murray","Up until the June payments, we had identified that our trends were higher than we would like, particularly for the 2012 new member issues. But we've also, as I said and Bruce said, we felt very good about our competitive positioning, and we thought it would be prudent for us to reevaluate where we were competitively and not denigrate our ability to sell business going forward and take the opportunity to put that into our bidding process. And so we felt really, really good about our bids that we filed in June. We feel less good about them now that they've -- we've seen the July results, but still feel very good that in total, they not only address the issues but restore some of the conservatism that existed in years prior to '11 and '12.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I want to talk about sort of the impact on 2013. I guess, I'm just having a little bit of trouble understanding. Jim, I guess, it sounds like you felt like you're going to get your benefit ratios more in line with historical norms or get them down, I guess, relative to what you're seeing. And then you're also building in a heftier level of conservatism and as we sort of think about 2011 and '12, the way those developed, obviously, cost runs came in a lot better. There were these sort of massive upward earnings revisions. So the part I understand why you want to get back there. But I'm looking at the second half guidance. It's down. There's a lot of moving parts depending on what you want to call onetime or favorable development. Your guidance second half is down 10% to 15% in terms of earnings. So is it conceivable that earnings would be up? When you talk about getting back to earnings growth, is it conceivable that earnings in 2013 would actually be up next year?","James H. Bloem","We can't postulate right now, as you know, Josh, on '13. But basically, if you look at the underwriting difficulties that we had in the first half, we've just really flipped those over to the second half and that's the major cause of why we have the issue this year. And separately, as was address, we believe that we've successfully put that behind us in the bid process for '13. So we feel good about where we are in the bids but again it's not time to take a look at that until we see everything that we'll get after the bids are approved by CMS. We go through that process and we see what everybody else has done. But I want them back to say all we did really is to take the first half shortfall in underwriting margin and reproject that into the second half of this year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Let me ask it a different way. You guys target 5% margins every year for your holistic book of business. It sounds like PDP is running a little bit better. Obviously, MA is worse. Is it your expectation that what you've done based on what you see in terms of claims will get to back to that 5% margin for your overall book of business next year?","James H. Bloem","That's correct.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And would you expect a reduction in membership or a slowdown in the growth? Or how do we think about that based on the fact that it would look like the benefit changes would have to be somewhat meaningful?","James H. Bloem","We have a very high confidence level that we will retain and grow. I think the question will be, will we have the growth that we had in 2011 and 2012? And I think some of the discussion is that the growth will continue to be at the 2010 level.","James H. Bloem","Again, we'll wait when we see what everybody has done and we know all our bids are approved and we see what everybody else's bids are. And as soon as we know that, within 30 days of that, we usually come out with our guidance for membership and earnings.","James E. Murray","One step we went through a great amount of detail to work through in the bids was to make the changes that we made to the benefit levels being more of a total -- more of the overall change than premium increases because we feel like the seniors that we serve are more amenable to accepting a benefit change as opposed to a premium change. So we went to a lot of efforts to make sure that we stuck to that kind of a philosophy.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, the second question just relates to this high level of confidence that things are better. You guys are looking at a 16% debt-to-cap. I think your parent cash is now 11% of the market cap, probably close to 13% based on where the stock's bidding. Is now the time to initiate a significant share repurchase or some sort of change in capital structure?","James H. Bloem","Well, our capital structure target for debt-to-cap still remains at 25% to 30%. But with respect to share repurchase, the board authorized $1 billion share repurchase on April 26. We spent $126 million of that through June 30 and obviously, we find a price at least at a closing today, very attractive. So we'll continue to do as the authorization allows us to do, which is basically to continue to repurchase shares in the open market and privately negotiated transactions. Having said that, though, our entire capital deployment strategy, I think, is we're really, since last year, been able to return a lot of capital to shareholders in the form of cash dividend and in share repurchase. Again, if you look at all last year, which was the first year we could do it, we gave about $623 million of the sum of share repurchase, plus cash dividends. And then the rest, we used of that $1.2 billion total dividend, the rest we used on CapEx and on acquisitions. In the first half of this year, it looks similar to that in terms of we've already returned $400 million to the shareholders. So again, we feel like we're going to continue to do that. We find the price attractive, and we'll continue to do as the authorization says.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You had mentioned earlier that there were some items in 2011 and that occurred up through February that were worked fully into the 2013 bids. How sizable is that? Is that equally impactful as the utilization change that was noted later on or is it smaller?","James E. Murray","The items that we talked about were the unprofitable markets. There were a number of markets that weren't running as we had anticipated or planned. And then you can see from the slide, the 2011 new member issues is a fairly sizeable issue. And so prior to what we saw develop in 2012, there was a pretty sizable group of things that we were attempting to accomplish when we did our 2013 bids. And then as the 2012 trend and new member information began to emerge in April, May and early June, we were able to add that portion into it into the 2013 bids. So again, the piece that we didn't catch is the July, early July, for June incurred claims. That amount is not significant, but it's something that we wish that we could have the time to put into the bid.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then as I think about the growth going forward, in the slides, there was a 20,000 member list in the amount of new age-ins this quarter and as I imagine part of that is from the baby boomer effect, which should continue. So how are you adjusting that in your product design going forward or your margin assumptions going forward that there will be increasingly new age-ins that, I guess, have a tendency to like more of these wellness items and have a higher MLR initially in the first 12 to 24 months?","James E. Murray","So the one thing that I would quickly throw out for everybody to evaluate is not only are we going to address the 2012 and '11 new member issues that we went through a lot of detail about. And also through our bid process, address some of the existing block. But for the new members that come in, in 2013 because we did all that we did with our bids, we feel pretty good about the fact that our new member results for 2013 will improve. And so that gets to your question about what are you doing about the age-ins because they're comprising a bigger component of the total. So that's one thing I would quickly throw out. The other thing that you ought to think about is the things that Bruce walked through in terms of timely identification of members to get into clinical programs, doing that a lot faster than we have heretofore. And also the documentation piece that Bruce talked about and going out and proactively visiting with the members where we think there's a documentation and chronically ill senior that can benefit from not only documenting their records properly, but also getting into clinical programs more timely. When you add all those pieces together, I think, it begins to address the issue that faces us as an industry that the age-ins at first, aren't as -- their benefit ratios aren't where the existing block is at. I hope that does it for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to get more comments about the increased utilization in the retail section. I guess, a lot of things, why -- is it something that wasn't present in the group MA business? It sounds like part of this is new members, part of this is existing utilization across the board. And anything about utilization versus product HMO versus PPO or geographic regions?","James E. Murray","The Group Medicare business is fine. There are no such things as age-ins in group Medicare. And so when we sit down with a group and we talk with them about their plan benefit, these folks that we're bringing into our programs have a similar benefit level than they've had in the past. And so a lot of the issues that we detailed here today don't really impact the group business. I can't remember some of your other questions. I apologize.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This type of product, is there a difference between HMO products and PPO or geography?","James E. Murray","Yes, I would think that predominantly, these are more related to the PPO products that we have. With the HMO products, there's more of an integrated care delivery kind of a model that we like a lot more. So I think from where we're seeing most of these issues, it's more from the PPO and little bit from the remaining private fee for service business that we have. But that's not a significant portion of our overall membership block.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Because when you said earlier that $100 million of the cost was from utilization across the entire book, that was just the retail book, not the MA book?","James E. Murray","That's correct. I said I was clear to say individual, but if I didn't, I apologize.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just was wondering why it wouldn't have flowed through to both if the senior population is using outpatient services, why it would be in one part of the book and not the other part.","James E. Murray","The other thing that I would quickly point out is that some of the benefit changes that are required by the new law don't really apply to the Group Medicare business and there is not as much messaging that applies to the Group Medicare folks. So some of the increased utilization we saw from the preventive benefits and the messaging that I talked about earlier don't really apply to the Group Medicare folks.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Because it sounds a little bit like you guys are talking about 2011, 2012 just getting more aggressive in your bidding and maybe getting a little bit of adverse selection. How much of what you've seen in the last few years you think is a bidding issue versus a utilization issue?","James E. Murray","Yes, I want to be real clear about your comment about adverse selection. When you look at the slide and the risk scores that are shown on the slide for the new members that came in, they're pretty consistent year-over-year. So I wouldn't stipulate that there's -- that we've gotten adversely selected against. I think our risk profile for the new members that we're bringing in is very consistent over time. And one of the other things that I would quickly point out is that we feel all members are good members for us as an organization. As long as we get our full share of the risk for all the cohorts of members, feel very good about that we're able to accomplish in terms of member being risk adjusted over a period of time. And so we don't think that there's any book of business or any member that over time can't be a favorable member for us.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And this $0.18 investment in clinical infrastructure, is that something that we should be annualizing into next year or is there some sort of ramp up that goes away or how do we think about that?","James H. Bloem","The way we describe it, Kevin, is that we said it's really this year in order to accelerate, as Jim and Bruce said, getting people into the correct clinical programs, the appropriate ones for them and to speed along the documentation process.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But that's not something you're going to keep as a matter of course going forward, it's kind of more of a one-time investment?","James E. Murray","The reason it was really highlighted is because it helped -- it didn't help, it hurt our overall guidance because it's an expense that we agreed to pay in the back half of the year. You won't see this going forward, because it will just be subsumed in all of our administrative spend as an organization but because we decided to do it in the back half of the year, it negatively impacted our overall guidance.","Michael B. McCallister","It's $0.18 of that $0.48. So that's why we thought we would give it special attention.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you said $0.18 on the clinical infrastructure, but I'm looking at your SG&A guidance and you might have brought this up already but it's gone up by 50 bps, which is pretty really substantial. And considering you made numbers for this quarter, your guidance write-downs seems largely also related to that. Can you give us more color on it?","James H. Bloem","Yes, the main thing in the SG&A ratio, for this year and for this quarter and the rest of the year is the TRICARE. The changing TRICARE with is worth 130 basis points. The accounting -- the economics remain as we've described, but the accounting for them where you go to a net basis is really the biggest difference. A then we also had, as I mentioned in my remarks, we had some special legal expenses. We culled out the settlement but not the legal expenses. And the legal expenses were in there as well, in the quarter for the Sacred Heart.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","When you guided, you brought it down to, I think, the $0.17 for the litigation settlement. That already contemplated the TRICARE and the Sacred Heart things. So is this new beyond what you had disclosed to us a few weeks ago?","James H. Bloem","The settlement itself, we estimated to be $0.17 on May 21 turned out to be $0.18. But the legal expenses associated with that are still in SG&A and not included in that.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So this is more kind of a one-time thing that we're talking about?","James H. Bloem","Yes, that's correct.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then for the next year, you're targeting 5%. You had your star scores in 2011. Given where you were, are you projecting for 2013 in terms of the total dollar amount for the 2013 plan year? And what have you given away in terms of stars and trend benders as you call them in your bids, are you still expecting any upside from any of that?","James E. Murray","When we do a bid, there's probably 7 to 8 assumptions that go into the bid process market-by-market and stars is one of those secular trends, trend benders, MRA and a lot of other factors. So as I said earlier, we felt -- we feel very good as a result of the 2013 bid process that we have -- gotten us back to the target margins that we've shared with you in the past. And that we've established some level of conservatism getting us closer to where we were in 2009 and '10. I'm not sure that we should go into individual assumptions and just talk about the package as a whole.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So it's 5% with some upside is what we should think about for '13?","James E. Murray","Our target margin was 5%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you go through the $1.18 in MA trend cut, sort of split it out between the 4 items, the 2011 new cohort, the 2012 new cohort and the ACA promoting higher costs and the rise in outpatient cost that you identified? So if I take those 4 things as being the main portion of that, how much of each of those was $1.18?","James H. Bloem","Well, I think the way -- Jim took us to a $270 million underwriting issue with respect to the Retail Segment. In his remarks, he talked about $170 million of that being the new member and a new member who I think would subsume 2 of the things that you mentioned. And then the rest of it, the other $100 million was in the trend for all, both new and existing members. That was sort of the messaging was part of that. And what was the other -- what was the fourth thing?","James E. Murray","Outpatient trend itself across the block.","James E. Murray","The outpatient is included in the $100 million. So if I were to estimate the split between the impact of the required benefit change and the messaging related to it versus the outpatient, it's probably 66% to 75% is related to the messaging and new benefit, and the outpatient cost represents the difference.","James H. Bloem","I think that's a fair allocation.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then can you separate the 2011 versus the 2012 cohort, how much of the problem was in each of those? Because presumably you caught the 2011 cohort problem in terms of your 2013 bid, but it's look like you were probably too late to catch the 2012 stuff in your 2013 bid. Is that accurate?","James E. Murray","The way I think about this whole issue is that for the July payments that weren't caught, we've talked internally that, that represents maybe $60 million to $80 million but that's offset with some of the things that I talked about that we contemplated in February. And so that last piece related to the June incurred claims that we spotted in July, we think again is somewhere around $60 million to $80 million.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Let me try it another way. If I look at the change in guidance, the $0.48, if I subtract that, the $0.18 for the charge, you're down to $0.30 being the incremental portion that you found sort of tied to that June or July claims with all the other onetime things netting against the rest of the trend change. So that $0.30, $0.04 of that was in slightly worse performance from other operations, it looks like. So it was down $0.26. So what's the $0.26 tied to? Which of those 4 buckets that I just described is really driving the $0.26?","James E. Murray","Also, $46 million of additional clinical spend that we...","James H. Bloem","I think that's the one thing he's talking about. And it happens to be in the same amount as the charge for the litigation, exact same number. So I wanted to just make sure that's clear. That comes out separately. So when you look of the rest of it -- repeat your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the remaining $0.26 of the change, how much is tied to each of the 4 things, the 2011 cohort, the 2012 cohort, the ACA higher costs and then the rising outpatient costs?","Operator","Your next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Regina Nethery","Excuse me, Christine, for one quick second. We were just hesitating on doing some internal calculations to answer Peter's question. So, Peter, I apologize. We'll get with you here in a second.","James H. Bloem","I would say it's probably 2\/3 is in the 2012 and the rest is in the '11. The '11 was caught and as Jim said, only the incremental part that comes from the $80 million that was caught in the early July when we saw the results from June in terms of paid claims.","Regina Nethery","Thanks, Jim. I'm sorry, Christine. Go ahead with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So just to follow-up on this because I think it really is all about 2013. A couple of follow-ups. One, are you assuming that the $200 million to $300 million benefit from your clinical interventions is going to be realized in your 2013 experience? Is that included in your bids in terms of -- and your expectation for the 5% margin?","James E. Murray","No. The trend benders that we made as a part of our 2013 bid had some clinical program benefits in it, but most of what Bruce detailed in the $200 million to $300 million would be incremental opportunities that we're pursuing that we would maybe begin to see the beneficial effect of during 2012. But we want to get really comfortable that those processes and procedures are in place by January 1, so that we can see a lot of that benefit that Bruce described flow into the 2013 year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So when you bid, did you assume you were going to get that $200 million to $300 million in 2013?","James E. Murray","No. We had a number of other trend benders that we do on a regular basis related to clinical programs but one Bruce identified for you explicitly aren't included in the trend benders that are a part of our 2013 bid. These would be more incremental opportunities.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then what are you expecting a Medicare Advantage trend this year? And what did you bid assuming it would be next year? And when did you realize you had the negative $40 million of development in retail?","James E. Murray","I'm not sure I know what the $40 million is that you're referring to. There's a lot of numbers that are getting thrown around. I will tell you that we've historically told everybody that we generally believe secular trends run in the 4% to 6% range and in our 2013 bids, we've got a number included on the higher end of that range on a secular trend basis.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And what do you think it's running this year?","James E. Murray","I don't know that that's something that we typically disclose.","James H. Bloem","We still say it's that same 4% to 6% but obviously, everything we told you today...","James E. Murray","Secular trends for us are running about 4% to 6%.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And when did you realize that you had the $40 million of prior period negative development in the second quarter related to the first?","James H. Bloem","Yes. That was generally ratable through each of the months. Again, as we said earlier, we had the other things that I've indicated show the fact that our guidance was still intact for both the end of the quarter and the year.","James E. Murray","Yes, as I talk through when I talk about the bids, we were looking at April incurs. We got that in May. We looked at May incurred and we saw that in June and whatever we saw in terms of a restatement related to the first quarter, we were spotting and we were evaluating regularly how our year looked after we did all of those claim evaluations. And again, it wasn't until the July, early July when we saw the June results that we thought we had problems for the year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then last question, if we had a $60 million to $80 million July problem that we -- the June problem we caught in July that we didn't put in the bids, do I take $60 million times 12 is the 2013 potential issue? Or is there something -- it sounds like that's not the logic you should be using because again get to 5% that way. Can you help me out and that's my last question.","James E. Murray","The $60 million to $80 million that I would talk about is what we project the impact for the remainder of the year as opposed to one particular month. I apologize, I should have been clearer about that. We look of the trends that we saw and we said, okay, what's the impact of those trends for the remainder of the year and that would be the $60 million to $80 million that I referenced a moment ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to make sure I get some of the numbers in the call earlier. I think you said that wellness visits are up 200% year-to-year and that routine physicals are up 22% year-to-year. Is that the Retail MA business, is that the entire Retail business or what was that or what is that?","Bruce D. Broussard","That's the individual or retail Medicare Advantage business. Somebody earlier asked whether we're seeing a similar problem in the Group Medicare business and the answer to that is no.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But those trends that 200% increase that's been apparent all year long and now you're basically saying that, that sort of -- those increased visits have led and assuming messaging that that's what's driving -- that's what drove the spike in June?","James E. Murray","Yes, what we're explaining by talking about that 270 and then offsetting it by some of the other things that we saw in our other segments is just to demonstrate what's happened to our retail business. And it happened as we've discussed throughout the first quarter. We learned about the first quarter issues in the second quarter as we pay claims for the April incurred and the May incurred. And as we saw those claim payments occur during the months of April, May and June, the issues that we just talked about began to emerge.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. I guess -- but was there anything specific to spike out on the outpatient side that was sort of a derivative of those things in June? Any particular type of service or just across-the-board outpatient?","James E. Murray","Pretty much across-the-board. I think, and we referenced this in my remarks, that we've been following -- as we've been seeing some of this occurring April and May, we've been also spotting that some of you have written up about some of the favorable reports from the hospital industry about their outpatient revenues. And it seems to correlate. But again, that outpatient issue was probably a very small portion of the $100 million that I talked about a moment ago. Probably 33% to 25% of that overall $100 million.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification question on Slide 8. Does this suggest that in 2011, your actual benefit ratio was quite a bit above the target benefit ratio?","James E. Murray","Yes, that's exactly what it suggests. And that's a part why in February, we stopped and said, okay, what do we need to do for our 2013 bid process? And as you can see from the slide, it got even worse in 2012.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And so if I were to -- what did your prior guidance assume? Did it assume that the black line was going down to get to the target for this year, or you always knew you were going to come in above?","James E. Murray","The guidance that we've talked about in the first quarter assumed the results that are demonstrated on the slide related to 2011. And one of the things that we tried to explain as we were walking through all of these pieces coming together is that some of the 2011 results that we experienced in 2011 could have improved in 2012 because we did all the documenting and the getting the folks into the program. So there are some, to the extent that we experienced that negative in 2011, what's happening in 2012 related to those members is something that have to go into this entire equation. And so when we provided our guidance in the first quarter, all of those pieces looked fine to us. And then as we moved through April and May and June, we began to see some of the 2012 begin to emerge and we regularly evaluate it where we were on our bid process and where we were in the guidance that we were preparing for all of you. And we were comfortable through the end of May incurred and early June that everything was in really good shape and we looked pretty good for the year.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Well, I guess, to make sure, what I'm really trying to get at. Did you previously think you could get to your target benefit ratio for new members individual Medicare or you always knew you were always going to come in above the target for 2012?","James E. Murray","For 2011, we were somewhere above our target in 2011 and whatever happened with those 2011 members in the 2012 incurred months went into our overall evaluation of how we were doing as an organization. In 2012, we began to spot the new member issue probably in the April and May time frames. And we began to spot it and we've began to deal with it and we would evaluate our bids and we also reevaluate our guidance. And it wasn't until the June incurred that we paid in July that it became apparent that we had a problem relative to our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What was the target margin that you included in the 2013 bid? So if you tell me the target margin was 5.5% or something higher than that, then everything you're saying today makes sense, in that you were projecting a higher margin, now you've seen something worse since you submitted the bids and that's going to take you down to 5%. Is that how you would position it or you would say something different?","James E. Murray","When we did our 2012 bids and when we did our 2013 bids, we targeted a margin of 5%.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","2012 was 5.5%?","Michael B. McCallister","To get back to something I said earlier. There's more conservatism in those bids. The target margin in there, though, is 5%.","James E. Murray","And in addition to that, we've got PDP business when you talk about our overall Medicare margins go to the guidance that we shared with you in the first quarter of 5.5% for our overall Medicare retail book of business.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So maybe I'll use different words. In terms of the margin that you actually thought you would see in 2013, that was originally in the initial bid, something north of 5% and that's now come back to 5%?","Michael B. McCallister","No, we've never said that.","James E. Murray","I'm sorry. What year bids are you talking about when the asked the question?","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","2013.","James E. Murray","Okay. So when we did our bids for 2013, before we learned about the June incurred payments that we learned about in early July, we felt very good that we were putting together a bid package that not only got to the 5%, but began to restore a significant amount of the conservatism that perhaps was missing in 2012 and 2011. When we got done studying the July information, I would say that our bids came closer to the 5%. However, I still feel like they include some level of conservatism, not as much as we had anticipated when we filed them in June.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the second question, just more high level. You've operated in a lot of difficult environments over the years. Other than the PDP blip back in 2008, you haven't had any problems with Medicare Advantage. And so I certainly understand all the specific issues you discussed, but they all seem to be things that you dealt with in one form or another in prior years. So in terms of the issue that you're having this year, would you attribute that to a confluence of events, is it, Mike, transitioning away from the business, is it the just lack of conservatism relative to prior years?","Michael B. McCallister","Well, let me take a shot at this. I think we've got unusual event going on that some of these new members combined with and yes, there is more demand for services from this population, combined with some pretty significant growth in it. So a couple of a perfect storm things come together here. I don't have any less confidence in our ability to deal with the annual bid process to get to the right place. We've been able to, or generally project well. We've been generally in the right spot in terms of finding the right balance for product offerings, price and benefits in the marketplace. We've had a long history of being able to sell this really well. We've grown better than anybody in the last few years. So if I step back to 50,000 feet, nobody's happy with the where we are this moment, but this company really does still very well understand what goes on in Medicare and I think has a pretty good path through all these complexities and all these moving parts you're talking about. So I'd rather be us than anybody else in this space.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you speak to what is assumed in the utilization trends that you will see subsequent to June for the balance of this year, what's assumed in guidance?","James E. Murray","That trend that we saw up through the June incurred date are rolled forward for the remainder of 2012.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So no worsening, but also no improvement.","James E. Murray","Absolutely. We don't want to do this again.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And is there -- actually just a couple of follow-ups to that. One, I guess, the 2011 cohort is certainly a contributor to the problem here. From an 18-month lag and you talked about 18 to 24 months for some of your documentation and program enrollment type of activities to take hold, is now the time when the '11 should start to benefit from that and those take hold and so they can bend down and I'm asking more from the concern about the underlying outpatient trend getting worse and would that be an offset?","James E. Murray","Dave, you're exactly right. And somebody just asked what happened here is the way I would interpret the answer. And when I step back and look at this in frustration and embarrassment, are words that come out of my mouth immediately. But I would say that the bolus of members that we have, there are new members and the higher medical expense ratio that we targeted for them and the fact that we got more of them and then that the 2012 cohort is performing worse than we've ever seen. And then where those 2011 members are on that 12 to 24-month journey, you put all those factors together and the fact that we had taken out some of the bid conservatism in 2012 and '11, that doesn't allow the existing book of business that isn't the new members to have favorable results relative to bids to offset some of these issues. When you add all those pieces together, it's where we're at and again, it's frustrating and it's not something that we're very happy about and I don't know what else to say about that.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","If I could ask just one follow-up on a different topic and that is the drug cost. Jim Bloem, you talked about not seeing the same favorable benefit from generics on drugs. We've heard some others actually expect that generic wave would have a favorable effect on cost trend in the second half of '12. I wondered why you don't expect that.","James H. Bloem","I was only -- my comments were based on comparing 2011 where you have lots of expirations and wholesale cost -- acquisition costs lowering the benefit ratio. Those won't be present this year. That's all I'm saying. [indiscernible] they still are good, but when you compare back to '11, it's not as good as '11. That was my only...","Operator","Your final question comes from Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess, just quickly in thinking about the earnings power past 2013. A quarter ago, we were talking a lot about this idea that Humana has positioned its bids to glide past the MLRs towards the MLR floor and I was sort of thinking through 2013 where with position bids trying to get MLRs back down to lower target. So how do we split those 2 things? Even if you do achieve closer to your target margins on 2013, then what type of maybe disruption or margin disruption we'll see going into 2014 because it would no longer seem like we were on a glide path for those MLR floors.","James H. Bloem","Well, I'll say to that is again, we've emphasized how important it is to get the members and that the members are what drive the dollar profit. The dollar profit around the target margin of 5% is what really gives us the earning power. So it's very important as we've started the conversation today with our strategy says we need to grow members and then we need to take those members, get them into appropriate clinical settings and get the right documentation. And that's why I think when Mike said a few minutes ago, he'd rather be us than anybody else because I think, on an organic basis, we do that as well as anybody and that's the key toward when you look beyond '13 and you get to '14 and beyond.","Michael B. McCallister","Okay. Well, thanks for joining us. Again, we're disappointed with where we are at the moment. I would remind everyone that even with the guidance for the full year '12 it will be the best -- second best year in the 50-year history of this company. We do feel pretty comfortable where we are with bids for '13. We believe we will have an opportunity to grow again in '13 and we'll back on track in this company by January 1, we believe. And I'd remind everybody that while these new members are currently causing us some economic problems, they will be with us for a long time and we have a lot of time to work with them and get them to a better place. So thanks for joining us and I'd like to thank the Humana associates that are on the call for helping us to continue to progress. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call.

Broussard","Thank you, and good morning. In today's call, I'll provide a brief recap of 2012, an update on our thoughts around 2013, and importantly, how we believe how 2013 positions us for continued success in 2014 and beyond.","Today, Humana reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share of $1.19 and full year EPS of $7.47, ahead of our previous expectations. Our 2012 results reflect the continued implementation of our company's strategy, offering our members affordable health care, combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets.","The strategy's engine is our integrated care delivery model, which is designed to seamlessly unite quality care and a high member engagement, enabled via sophisticated data analytics. We believe this strategy is positioning Humana for sustainability and growth in membership and earnings.","In 2012, we furthered the implementation of this strategy and achieved some notable milestones. First, we saw significant progress in our Star quality rating from CMS. For bonus year 2014, our average Star rating increased from 3.28 to 3.82. The contract that includes the majority of our Florida membership earned 4.5 stars. We have the only plan offered by a publicly traded organization that has earned a 5-Star rating, and most significant is that the percentage of our members and plans rated 4 Stars or above increased to 40%.","Our second milestone for 2012 was that we significantly expanded our HMO offerings. We believe HMOs allow our integrated delivery model to work more effectively for our members than any other option plan. The percentage of Individual Medicare Advantage members who chose to enroll in our -- in an HMO reached 48% during the AEP and is expected to continue to rise through the remainder of the year. We anticipate the full year will show new HMO enrollment of over 50%, our highest since the implementation of Medicare Modernization Act in 2006.","Our third milestone, we were successful in our bids for Medicaid business in Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky, including individuals dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid in both Ohio and Illinois.","Fourth, we furthered the build-out of our integrated care delivery model through our acquisitions of Metropolitan Health and Certify Data Systems and through our investment in MCCI and JenCare. In addition, we acquired approximately 50 primary care providers that we integrated into our concentric care delivery network.","The last 2012 milestone I'll highlight is the noteworthy action we took in connection with the issues we experienced with our second quarter results, by accelerating infrastructure investment to quickly address problems stemming from our enrolling new -- more new members than higher-than-expected medical benefit ratios. Later in the call, I'll review the details to our progression.","For 2013, we continue to anticipate full year earnings per share in the range of $7.60 to $7.80. In his remarks, Jim Bloem will describe some recent developments that give us further comfort with this range. The increasing strong foundation that our operational initiatives will build in -- on in 2013 reinforces our belief in our ability to achieve continued success in 2014 and subsequent years.","Next, I'll walk you through some of the factors developing for 2013 and why we are encouraged by our prospects. I'll begin with Medicare membership growth from the annual election period. Our January Medicare Advantage individual enrollment of just over 2 million, up from 83,000 from December, including approximately 75,000 HMO members. This all further supports our confidence in our projection for the full year net addition of 100,000 to 120,000 individual Medicare Advantage members. This net increase from December includes the required divestiture of approximately 13,000 members related to last year's Arcadian acquisition.","Our January Group Medicare Advantage members are up approximately 13,000 from December as net changes in fully insured Group Medicare membership outpaced the loss of our 29,000 member Group Medicare ASO account on January 1. This puts us on track for our projected full year membership growth of approximately 20,000 for Group Medicare Advantage.","With respect to standalone PDP membership, the AEP growth of approximately 127,000 members has resulted in us adjusting our guidance slightly upward. We now anticipate net growth in standalone PDP membership for 2013 of 135,000 to 175,000.","As we've discussed with you in the past, one of the important elements of our strategy is the movement of our membership into full-risk model, which we believe represents the future of health care delivery. Increasing care delivery is providing to the gold standard for providing quality, affordable care to members while simultaneously offering them a positive health care experience.","At the end of 2012, approximately 26.5% of our individual Medicare membership was in full-risk models, where providers' incentives are appropriately aligned with the quality experience we want our members to have. We expect that number to grow another 1% or 2% during 2013. As we've shared with you before, our goal is to have 50% of our individual Medicare Advantage membership in full-risk integrated care delivery models by 2017.","Provider interest in migrating towards the full-risk model continues to be strong, and the number of providers engaged in the path to risk is large and moving in the right direction. We're accelerating our relationship with risk providers as we leverage the MSO capabilities of our recent Metropolitan acquisition and MCCI investment. With these transactions, Humana now employs -- has strategic investments for MSO contracts with nearly 2,500 providers nationwide.","To improve transparency around how we are progressing and implementing our integrated care delivery model, beginning this quarter, our earnings news release will provide quarterly updates on a number of operational statistics with respect to care management, provider relationships and membership.","I've spoken in the past about the need to move quickly to get our members identified for the appropriate clinical programs. Let me briefly highlight some of the related operational statistics that are indicative of our progress here.","We've increased the number of care management professionals to 6,700 at the end of 2012 versus 3,800 at the end of 2011. We've targeted 55,000 in-home member health assessments for 2012. We actually exceeded that target by 5,000, completing 60,000 such assessments last year.","Members living with multiple chronic conditions enrolled in our chronic care program at a significantly higher rate than 2011. 2012 saw a 13% increase in eligible membership that enrolled in these programs, bringing the total at the end of the year to 150,000. We anticipate that number will expand again in 2013 with the timing of that enrollment importantly weighted toward the first part of the year.","Our Anvita-powered gaps-in-care alert system led to nearly 690,000 such gaps being closed as members and their providers responded to alerts sent out during the third quarter, a closure rate of approximately 40%. This compares to gaps-in-care closure rate of 29% only 1 quarter earlier.","By quickly assessing our members' health conditions and needs, and guiding them to the appropriate care pathways, we believe we are able to improve their health status, enhance their quality of life, enabling aging with grace in their homes, and reduce the incidence and cost of institutional health care, thus improving their health care experience. In summary, we believe Humana's strategic focus and operational discipline positions us well for the challenges ahead. While it's too early to provide any specifics about 2014 earnings, we continue to be confident in our ability to grow both our Medicare membership and our earnings moving forward.","Owning to -- owing to our accelerated and effective preparatory work around administrative cost reductions, clinical infrastructure expansion and integrated delivery -- care delivery enhancement, at this time, we do not foresee any significant impediments to reaching these growth targets. Our long-term belief is that the health care cost and experience can greatly improve through a model that incorporates fixed payments for caring for one's health while enabling individuals to meet their unique needs through choices and incentives for quality. In that context, our experience with Medicare Advantage, combined with the development of the integrated care delivery model, will foster Humana's success for years to come, short-term headwinds notwithstanding.","And lastly, I'd like to thank Mike McCallister for his 38 years as a Humana associate, including 13 years as our CEO. Mike has been an exceptional leader, and I'm pleased that I will continue to have the privilege of working with him as -- ongoing role as Humana's Nonexecutive Board Chairman.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim for a review of our financials.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. While 2012 was a year of challenges, it enabled us to continue to prepare for 2014 and beyond. I'll first walk through our fourth quarter 2012 results before turning to our updated expectations for 2013.","Looking first then at the full year 2012, we're pleased with our earnings of $7.47 per share, which exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.17. As noted on the slide, the combined $88 million of improved fourth quarter operational performance in both our Retail and Employer Group Segments was partially offset by lower-than-expected results in both our Health and Well-Being Services Segment and Other Businesses. Overall, the net consolidated operating performance improvement of $69 million or $0.27 per share over the last 90 days was gratifying.","On the plus side, the better-than-expected performances of our Retail and Employer Group Segments were each driven by a lower benefit ratio and a lower operating cost ratio than previously forecast. The Retail Segment benefited most from a lower Medicare Advantage medical cost trend in the second half of the year. Our standalone PDP result also came in slightly better than forecast while our individual major medical business was in line with our previous forecast.","Additionally, as indicated on the slide, we experienced a much more severe flu season than we anticipated. This widely publicized severity resulted in an additional $25 million or $0.10 per share medical cost in December, mostly impacting our Retail Medicare Advantage business. These incremental flu costs primarily were driven by a sharp increase in hospital admissions associated with respiratory diagnoses. We saw these admission levels peak just before the middle of January, with steady abatement occurring since then. We estimate the total 2012-2013 incremental cost of these flu-driven admissions to be around $75 million with approximately 2\/3 of that amount occurring in the first quarter of 2013, which corresponds to the occurrence of the peak in mid-January.","Now looking at the Employer Group Segment. The operating overperformance there was driven equally by our commercial group businesses, as well as our Group Medicare Advantage business. Each of which, like the Retail Segment, also benefited from a moderating medical cost-trend environment. Additionally, we continue to realize improvement in our operating cost structure for both these lines during the quarter.","Turning next to our Health and Well-Being Segment. The $17 million of lower-than-anticipated fourth quarter pretax income primarily was due to our pharmacy operations, which experienced higher-than-expected costs associated with an operational system upgrade for our RightSource mail order tablet dispensing system. We believe most, if not all of these system ramp-up issues will be addressed by the end of March and, accordingly, have anticipated some continuation of these expenses into the first quarter of 2013. Additionally, the closing of the Metropolitan Health and MCCI transactions resulted in $12 million of transaction-related expenses that were not included in our previous forecast.","Looking further at our Other Businesses results for the quarter, we recorded approximately $33 million or $0.13 per share in long-term care expenses, primarily associated with the reserve strengthening of our closed-block long-term care policies. As you may recall, we performed an annual actuarial review of the assumptions underlying these reserves at year end. In the course of this year's review, we noted that long-term care claimants were staying on claim longer than we had reflected in our actuarial models. Accordingly, we adjusted our actuarial persistency assumptions for these claims, which, in turn, necessitated the additional reserves.","And finally, for the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate came in lower than previously estimated, primarily as a result of, first, truing up our prior estimates of the negative impact of nondeductible compensation as defined by the Affordable Care Act and the settlement of a multiyear state tax dispute. Both of these favorable items occurred in December and resulted in a 32% effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2012.","Turning now to 2013. We are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. This slide highlights 3 principal items in our guidance that have changed since early November. As with our review of 2012, let's start with our revised assumptions regarding our 2013 expected operating performance.","Starting on the left with the Retail Segment, we anticipate 2013 operating pretax income results to improve by approximately $45 million or $0.18 per share over our previous projection. This improvement is driven primarily by the continued organization-wide focus on operating efficiencies, as well as a slightly improved outlook for medical cost trends. We expect these operating improvements to be offset by the flu season that I described earlier, which is the most severe that Humana has experienced in at least a decade.","Turning next to the Employer Group. We expect our 2013 operating results to improve by approximately $10 million, again, partially offset by the estimated first quarter flu impact for this segment as well. The improvement of our Employer Group outlook is driven by both the reduced operating cost structure, as well as a slight improvement in medical cost trends that we experienced in the second half of 2012 in both our commercial and Group Medicare Advantage businesses, as I described earlier. However, with respect to the commercial medical cost trends, as in prior years, we remain very cautious and continue to anticipate an increase of 150 basis points, plus or minus 50 basis points, although we are quite pleased that this uptick has yet to occur.","Looking now at our Health and Well-Being Services Segment. We expect 2013 pretax income to improve by approximately $40 million from our previous guidance to a range of approximately $500 million to $550 million, primarily due to the expected $52 million or $0.20 per share contribution from Metropolitan Health. Additionally, we have lowered our outlook for our mail order pharmacy business by $12 million for the fourth quarter system ramp-up issue discussed previously.","With our expectations for results in our Other Businesses not changing materially, we need only to highlight the additional interest expense of $38 million or $0.14 per share we expect to incur as a result of our $1 billion senior notes offering in early December. Most of the offering proceeds were used to fund the strategic transactions completed in the fourth quarter.","So for the full year, we continue to see earnings per share within the range of $7.60 to $7.80, including the previously disclosed $75 million or $0.30 per share of accelerated and enhanced investments in our MSO and primary care capabilities. As Bruce described, we expect that these investments will benefit us significantly over the long term, both in competitive positioning and profitability.","Turning last to our expected 2013 quarterly earnings pattern. This show --this slide shows the timing of the major items that we expect are -- to impact our earnings from quarter-to-quarter. These items include the annually discussed seasonal factors, most of which you are familiar with over the years. Our growing Health and Well-Being Services Segment businesses do not exhibit material seasonality, thus they don't apply -- they don't appear on the slide.","Based on this slide, our first quarter 2013 earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share is consistent with our initial view of the first quarter typical -- the first quarter's typical relative contribution to our expected full year results, and we do not anticipate any significant 2013 differences from our 2012 quarterly run rate earnings pattern. To conclude, we are gratified with the results reported today and are confident of our prospects moving forward.","With that, we'll open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk in a little more granularity about the transition process for -- to HMO products? And what year -- have you set quantitative goals that you can share there, and maybe just tell us how that's going with some market examples?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. Yes, we've set targets. I think that the target that we had shared with a lot of you in the November Investor Day here in Humana detailed a lot of those. I don't have those in front of me that -- but if you reference those materials, you can see those. And philosophically, what we're attempting to try to do on a market-by-market basis is have a conversation with our members about the additional benefits and lower premiums that they can enjoy with the HMO products. As you know, the HMO products are more like the integrated care delivery model that Bruce detailed in his remarks. And that's where we can create a lot of economic benefits for the members that we serve, and also, the satisfaction measures and experience for the members is enhanced with that model. And so the conversations that our market point selling representatives have with the individual members goes through a lot of that discussion with them.","Bruce D. Broussard","Matt, just to add to that, as I think you know, we are -- it's sort of a 2-step process. One is building capacity, and the building the capacity is around bringing the providers to the risk-based contracting. And as we've talked about, we've had great progress in that. And then the second aspect, as Jim was alluding to, we are also focusing in certain markets. I think when everyone was here in November, we talked about 5 markets, maybe increasing that to 7 markets. But our intention is to be very, very strong in those 5 to 7 markets and the ability to build the integrated delivery system.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just, if I could, one last question here. As you -- and I realize it's early, but as you look ahead to 2014, do -- is it your judgment at this point that you would make a member benefit reduction commensurate with the amount of the industry fee that's being introduced if, in fact, it's introduced as scheduled for next year?","James E. Murray","This is Jim again. Obviously, there's a lot of things that have to go into the pot to try to figure all that out. It's our intention to recover the industry fee in either lower benefits or higher premiums. But as you know, what has to happen with the funding with the government is something we'll learn in the next couple of weeks, where our competition is, what we are able to do with the 15 Percent Solution that you're all familiar with, secular trends, risk revenue and some of the good work we're doing around the in-home assessments and the whole integrated care delivery model progression that we're detailing here. So there's a lot of things that we study market-by-market, but it's our intent to recover that fee, both on a pretax and in those cases where we can on an after-tax basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess just to follow up on that last thought there. When we get the 45-day notice in a couple of weeks, what are you guys anticipating in that in terms of sort of a base rate update for 2014?","James E. Murray","There's a lot of things that we read about. Many of you have different opinions about what ultimately will happen. We have our own ideas about some of the variables that go into that funding rate that we look for. When we step back, we look at it, we're sensing something that is flattish to slightly down. And that's an environment that we've demonstrated in the past that we can live with. But again, that's a lot of studying, a lot of by-market evaluations on all of the things that I just talked through here a moment ago, and lots of work to do in and around the February through April time frames. But again, based upon what we're sensing, we feel comfortable that we'll be able to come out with a set of products, benefits and premiums that will be very attractive to the members that we serve.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Retail Segment medical loss ratio guidance, it's up 50 basis points. When I look at the impact of the flu -- I guess what's driving that increase? Does it have anything to do with the recent acquisitions, or is it all just on the cost trend side?","James H. Bloem","It's all on the cost trend side. It's basically the worst flu season we've had in more than -- in at least a decade. And as we showed, it's in the fourth quarter for about $25 million and it's carried over, peaking in mid-January in 2013.","James E. Murray","Yes. Relative to our prior guidance, it's the flu. There's also some additional quality measures we're doing around our drug programs that we've identified some additional costs related to that and also the in-home assessments and them included in that benefit ratio calculation, a very -- a part of that increase.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And so when I look at the -- on the -- on Slide 12, in the $45 million benefit from operations that you're projecting, is that -- I guess I'm just trying to figure out the math here, because it looks like $45 million would be less than 50 basis points. And is the $45 million of benefit not in the cost side, or how should we think about the net impact here?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. On the operating cost, the operating cost is down versus the last projection as well. So the increase in benefit ratio is offset by a lowering of the operating cost ratio.","Bruce D. Broussard","The admin cost ratio.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just want to follow up here on the MLR question, the Retail Segment. So you had -- clearly, we've seen a big flu season. But you had previously mentioned last year that you had about $50 million of investments in improving medical outcomes, improving risk scores that would drive something in the neighborhood of $200 million to $300 million in improved economics. Was curious for an update here in how that works again -- potentially could have worked against the MLR.","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. The -- I'm extremely proud of what we've done in the last -- in a couple of quarters around the second quarter initiative. We identified a couple of problems that were -- existed in our Medicare Advantage individual business, and Bruce detailed a lot of the good work that we did in that regard. And as you saw in the third quarter and now again in the fourth quarter, we began to produce improvements around our medical cost trends in the Retail Segment. That run rate of improvement is something that detail -- that Jim Bloem detailed in his remarks earlier. Again, I feel very good about a lot of the good work that we did, and we'll see how that all plays out. It's really early here to claim any improvement in our guidance for 2013. And again, we'll see whether or not some of this good work has beneficial effects going into 2013, and we can talk through that probably in the first and second quarter.","James H. Bloem","And we will [indiscernible] around 5% this year on overall basis.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then, Jim Murray, you mentioned at the Investor Day that you expected to grow Medicare Advantage membership and earnings in 2014. I'm just curious if there's any change, at least in your view, since the company doesn't seem to be giving -- obviously, it's early for '14 guidance. But clearly, you had a pretty strong view there at the Investor Day.","James E. Murray","And I continue to have a strong view. I'll feel even stronger after we go through our bid evaluation process in February through April. But again, we're doing a lot of really good things to control our medical trends around the 15 Percent Solution and the integrated care delivery model. I felt very good at Investor Day about our ability to continue to grow and make additional profits, and nothing has changed from that point in time. In fact, as I look at some stuff, I feel even better.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question just relates to some of the changes that you guys have made post second quarter of last year around your ability to identify and help control some of the new membership that's coming in on the Retail MA side. And I think I heard you talk about in-home assessments that would actually -- the target being down, I guess, maybe 5,000 year-over-year. So I'm just curious, what are you doing to give yourselves additional comfort? What signs can we look for early on to make sure that we know these new members are coming in at profit levels that are commensurate with your guidance?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes. I think, first, the -- we were actually higher in assessments by 5,000. We've -- we targeted 55,000, and we actually completed 60,000 in that regard. And we're seeing -- as Jim was alluding to in his comments just a few minutes ago, we are seeing some very positive aspects coming out of that and being able to get our chronic members on a managed program quicker and being able to have more effect both on the care model and also the cost.","James E. Murray","Yes. The -- a lot of the things that we detailed at the time of the second quarter were programs to identify folks a lot more rapidly than we had in the past. We talked about the fact that, generally, it could have taken up to 6 months or 9 months to identify folks for chronic programs. So we're reaching out more rapidly than we had in the past to have folks do HRAs. We've implemented some predictive models based upon early claim information that we're seeing to identify those folks that we need to make outreaches to. Bruce talked through the additional market based and chronic nurses that are a part of our programs. I think we more than doubled the number of nurses that are a part of our acute programs, as well as chronic programs. As we always do, we evaluated the risk scores year-over-year. We've studied January claim payments and identified the amount that was related to the flu by the codes that we see related to that. We pulled that out and then we studied our utilization statistics, and they seem to be pretty much in line. And then importantly, and we talked about this last year, we changed our targeted MERs for new members. You'll recall that we said last year that our target had actually got a little bit more aggressive. We actually reduced that target MER for this year, somewhere, on a market-by-market basis, anywhere from 200 to 400 basis points. And so that will have a beneficial effect on these new members that we got this year in the AEP. So all in all, we feel very good about what we've done to address the new member issue, and we're not seeing any evidence that we've got a concern there.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's great, Jim. Just so in terms of magnitude, is it more -- the health risk assessments and the reviews that you did, I think the 60,000 assessments you did last year, just in terms of sizing the magnitude, is it a bigger impact in '13 the prior year assessments that you're now going to get paid for or -- and\/or moving people into the chronic care program? Or is it more...","James E. Murray","The -- I'm sorry, the 60,000 assessments that we did will have a beneficial effect on the MRA revenues that we get in 2013 and also will positively impact the timeliness of getting people into programs. Some of that beneficial effect began at the tail end of '12, but it will play (sic) [pay] more dividends in 2013. That 60,000 is probably going to be significantly increased in 2013, because we're seeing that the in-home assessments is extremely beneficial for us from a P&L standpoint, both identifying people for programs, as well as enhancing risk revenue.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then just a quick question on the capitation payments that you made in the fourth quarter that drove down the payables, is that risk-sharing agreements? Is that just a bigger impact this year because you're growing your risk sharing?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. Yes. If you look at that, that was -- the schedule in the press release is a year-to-date number on the capitation, and that is a lot of growth in the HMO. And actually, as you -- we look to the next couple of years, we'll continue to see that -- to have an impact as we grow our HMO business. Sequentially, during the quarter, what happened, if you look at the claim inventory levels now versus at the end of September, you'll see that was the biggest reason for the drop, as well as the cut-off with our pharmacy processor. So you'll see that on Page 20, I think, of the press release.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you go over the medical cost-trend components a little bit with me? Just -- I'm not quite sure I followed exactly what you expect cost trend to be this year, in 2013. And then if you could, what's causing the 150 basis points of increase in the commercial medical cost trend?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve again, Peter. So both your questions are about the commercial trend, I take it. So I think what we said is that this year we saw trend come in at around 5% for 2012. And next year, we plan on that ultimately going up 150 basis points, and I think we've been saying that for quite a while now. And we do expect it to kind of -- to increase and to return to what maybe the historical norms are. But that's been slower to play out than we expected, so we continue to be cautious about that, want to be cautious with our pricing. So as we look forward to 2013, we've assumed a return to the 6.5% range. And -- but so far, we really haven't seen any indication of it going there yet. But ultimately, we think it will.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And can you break up the components of that, please?","Steven E. McCulley","Yes. I don't have that in front of me, but it tends to be utilization driven. We would expect -- the utilization has been lower than historical norms in both the inpatient and, to a less degree, the outpatient side. But I would say the inpatient is -- utilization is the biggest driver.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the new disclosure page that you have, can you describe exactly what it takes to be other versus path to risk versus full risk? What defines which member is in which of those categories?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve again. I'll take a run at that. The path to risk, our HMO members that are in an HMO contract, and they're either targeted to go to risk or we expect that a fair percentage of those will ultimately go to risk. Some of those -- some of these providers have actually signed up for risk arrangements. And as their panel sizes reaches a credible panel size, they'll flip to the risk category. So there will always be some HMOs that stay fee-for-service HMO, but we look at that as kind of as a step towards full risk and risk assumption.","James E. Murray","This is Jim. One of the things that we attempt to do is we have integration continuum, if you will, and one of the first steps is incentivizing providers for a lot of the quality measures that the government evaluates us on. So we'll pay folks for higher preventative screenings and higher ultimate HEDIS scores, obviously, and satisfaction numbers. As we move down that continuum, we might add things like utilization statistics on a by-provider or a by-market basis and then, ultimately, full risk is the final. So that path to risk is attempting to get folks aligned with the kinds of things that are necessary to manage in a population health or integrated model kind of perspective, and it's just a learning journey, if you will.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So payments don't really tie to the path to risk category, correct? It's just -- the hope that they will eventually be there.","James E. Murray","Pardon me? Can you help me? I'm not sure I'm following your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I guess another way of saying the question is -- get to the final point. Your capitation payment that went up this year, so the -- causing the DCP to come down. If I look at the path to risk, I can see why that would be -- have grown. But the way you described it didn't sound like it's actually capitation payments. It's just more members on -- in contracts that are expected to eventually be under risk contract.","James E. Murray","In an HMO, you'll pay a primary care physician a capitation payment. And in addition to that, if they deliver significant improvements in HEDIS measures and quality bonus scores, you might pay them an incentive on top of that capitation payment.","Steven E. McCulley","Yes, Peter. So on the days in claims payable, even for a fee-for-service type HMO or a non-risk HMO, I should call it, the primary care physician will be capitated and some of the specialty network can be capitated as well. So you move that expense from an IBNR-type expense to a capitation expense, even if it is not listed.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So there is a correlation to the DCP line [indiscernible] path to risk...","James E. Murray","Yes, absolutely.","James H. Bloem","The more HMO we have, the lower...","Bruce D. Broussard","You'll see that metric that many of you follow continue to go down over time as more and more of our members go to HMO.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just sticking with the commercial bucket for a minute here. You had some commentary in your press release about your commercial enrollment, I think, indicating about 59% of it was small group. I wonder if you could give us a sense of kind of how much does your small group book contribute to the overall profitability at Humana, just as we think about 2014 and 2015 and exchanges and all that stuff. And then secondly, I had a question on your -- the recently awarded Florida long-term care program, which I believe Humana is protesting. What do you think were the state's primary decision factors in awarding that business? Any sense or insight you could give us there would be great.","Unknown Executive","I'll take the Florida side. And we really don't want to comment on the -- on our relationship with the states and all the aspects going on, both because we normally don't do that, and second, we're working with them today on the protest.","James E. Murray","And then on the small group business, it is a profitable part of our overall Employer Group results. So I don't know that I would give a percentage, but it's certainly one of the larger parts of the profit there, maybe...","James H. Bloem","Certainly on the commercial side.","James E. Murray","On the commercial side. There's also -- the Medicare Group business is in there, which does well -- and the large group business as well. But it -- the small group is profitable.","James H. Bloem","Your question is well placed with respect to our -- the weighting of our membership. We have, as a percentage of our commercial group business, more is in small group than is typical.","James E. Murray","We're very pleased with the performance of our small group business. It continues to do well financially and grow. I think they're probably somewhere in their 27th or 30th month of consecutive monthly growth, and so we're really pleased with the way that it's developing.","Bruce D. Broussard","As we look at 2014, one of the analysis that we've done is, internally, our relationships, our membership is skewed to more professional groups and higher -- well, more professional groups, I'll leave it at that. And what we find is that the transition or the anticipated transition of that group to exchanges is actually in the lower level than something like a Retail or even the restaurant business. So we feel that we are in a good position in dealing with the transition of 2014, both in preparing for exchanges, but then secondarily, as we look at our relationships with our customers today.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So given that, would you suggest that your expectations, at least right now, given what we all think about exchanges and whatnot, is that the contribution from your small group book going into the next few years is probably not going to be impacted that much? Is that fair?","James E. Murray","That's a fair characterization. We've done some long-term projections and models as a part of our strategic planning. And although there are some movement from our small group block into the individual exchanges, we don't think it's very significant because of what Bruce described a moment ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the HMO-PPO split. You had talked about, at the end of the year, being sort of over 50% on the HMO side from just under 50%. I guess I'm just getting to -- would like to get a read in terms of longer term, where that percentage, where you'd like that to go, where we should think about it going, and then if you can help at all to sort of frame the MLR differential and the MLR between the 2.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think on the HMO, we probably really are measuring longer term on the integrated delivery model, which really relates to having relationships and membership in the risk-contracting area. And we anticipate that to be at 50% by 2017, which today, as we mentioned, it's right in the 27% or so range, and we anticipate that increasing by 1% or 2% this year, in that vein. We really are not giving long-term visibility into the HMO side as we think, really, the investor should be focused on the integrated delivery model and the benefits from that point of view. In regards to your second discussion, I don't think we've given detail out on the MLR side. Steve, have we?","Steven E. McCulley","No, we haven't, not by HMO and PPO. And -- but I don't know that they -- for non-risk, I mean, they wouldn't be that different. So there'll always be some non-risk HMO and some PPO business which will do well for us. But I think the key is what Bruce said, driving towards that 50% in risk arrangements by 2017 is what we're pushing for.","James E. Murray","When you think philosophically around the HMO, the goal there is to drive our costs lower so that we can offer more benefits to the membership. And so that's an evaluation that we have to make on a year-by-year basis, how much of that cost improvement we pass back to the membership.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think a slide that we have shared with the investors over the years -- or over the last year is that comparator to the Medicare original cost and what we see, full risk is around 71% of Medicare. And when you look at no provider incentives at all, it's around 91%. And as we've stated before, also when you look at our quality scores in the integrated model with global risk, they are much higher. So we continue to be firm believers that we'll see a substantial increase in quality and decrease in cost as we see this moving from a -- more into the integrated delivery model.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, just going back to the industry tax in 2014 and sort of the ability to offset that. Is the expectation essentially that you'll hold the 5% margin net of the tax on potentially sort of softer top line or see lower margin on higher premium revenue?","James E. Murray","This is Jim. That's yet to be played out. The comment that we would like to you -- have you all take is that we continue to believe strongly that we'll be able to grow and make a tremendous or a significant amount of profitability over time. The geography of whether it's pretax of after tax, we'll have to figure out as we lay out all the bidding variables that go on a market-by-market evaluation. We feel very good about our ability to grow and earn a fair profit going forward though.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A question on some studies that have come out suggesting that people who disenroll from Medicare Advantage may, in fact, be sicker people. And so we've seen a Health Affairs study and then another one today out of CMS. Could you comment on that please?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. I have not seen any of those studies. We are very happy to take all comers. To us, it doesn't matter, because of the risk-adjusted revenue, what the person's particular illnesses are. And so I don't have any of that information that you just referenced.","James H. Bloem","We do think our care delivery model...","James E. Murray","It produces better outcomes for the people that we serve, and I think our quality Star performance begins to demonstrate that. And so we'll look at what you just referenced. But I've never seen that, and that's kind of a surprise to me.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think as we've said many, many times, we're seeing continued tenure of our relationship with our customers to be in the 7-year range, and we continue to see them aging with us. And as you've seen from our investments in our chronic program and our transitional program, that we're making quite a large impact both on the quality of care and the cost of care. So this study, I think we should probably should look at, but we're not seeing it in our business as a whole.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then should I think of the 26.5% as the percent of cost capitated? Is that the right way to think about it, or is it more of a qualitative metric than I'm making it?","Steven E. McCulley","No, I wouldn't -- this is Steve. There's also capitation expense in the other categories as well, so you can't really make that comparison. So that's just the members that are currently in risk-type arrangements.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then final question. With the benefit of hindsight in 2012, do you think part of the problem could have been the constraining of diabetes codes or having maybe missed the opportunity for the class of '11, which was so large, to properly code them as much as maybe you can?","James E. Murray","This is Jim. As we studied the root causes for all of our issues, that has not popped up as anything that has -- something that we've identified. We've been pretty clear on some of the things that faced us around the new members and the additional messaging and some of the outpatient costs that we experienced. I've not heard anybody explain what you just referenced as something that caused some of our problems.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could go back through the seasonality. You indicated that it was kind of similar to last year in your new guidance, but it feels like it is actually a little bit more front-end loaded into Q1, I guess particularly, if you were to say that the Q1 number is $0.20 held back because of flu. That would imply almost $2 of earnings in the first quarter, which would really seasonally push things to the first quarter versus your guidance. So wanted to understand -- I appreciate the chart that was there. But those factors are all factors that we've seen in the last several years. Is there anything that would make this seasonality more pronounced than it might otherwise have been?","Steven E. McCulley","Kevin, this is Steve. Look, comparing to last year, there's a big -- because of leap year last year, there is a favorable kind of weekday seasonality advantage in 1Q this year, and that's a big factor, as well as the $0.30 of investments that we've spoken to are a little bit more weighted towards the back part of the year. So those would be the 2 things I would cite.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the increased disclosure that you have on the physician side of things. Is there anything that we should be looking for as far as tracking that data from quarter-to-quarter? Do you expect a consistent increase in those numbers over time? Or is there a period where you say, well, we're doing Open Enrollment for January 1, so the data, as we get our networks together, should jump in Q4 or Q1, or how do you think about any seasonality in those metrics as we go forward?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. The -- what I would be looking at those to give you comfort on is that the investment spend that we've talked to you about, where we would be acquiring physician practices over time, is beginning to play itself out, because that begins to demonstrate the building of the integrated care delivery model. And the other piece is the care professionals that are identified. And the more care professionals that we have that are focused on the chronically ill seniors, the better you'll feel about that -- if 20% of our seniors are complex chronically ill and contribute 60% of the cost, that will give you a better sense on how we're doing to measure or control some of that spend. And so those are the 2 things that I would be looking for is the building of the integrated model and also our focus on the chronic costs that are a big part of what we spend year after year.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I guess the question is around timing. I mean, is there a sense that you say, well, if you haven't signed someone up by Q3, then that means you're behind track, or how do we think about the timing of that?","James E. Murray","Well, I think the members -- the member statistic will take, obviously, a bigger jump on the 1\/1 renewals. And -- but the providers' statistics, on the other page, will tend to grow more ratably as we build out the network. So over the course of the year, you will see a little bit of increase on the membership side as agents come in. And as some providers on a path to risk, their membership panels reach a credible size, and those members will jump into risk arrangements as well. But those won't be big jumps. The big jumps will happen 1\/1 on the membership side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Murray, your previous comments about the 45-day notice, I wondered if you could give us the positives that you're anticipating that would offset the negatives that we're aware of. So coding intensity is 150 basis point headwind, what gives you confidence that we get to flat to slightly down?","James E. Murray","Well, as we've talked many times in the past, there's about 10 variables that go into this calculation. The amount of the secular trends that we use as an organization year-over-year and what's happening with secular trends, the trend benders that we've talked with all of you about many times. And with -- because of the good work that we did during 2012, our anticipation would be that the trend benders that we have as an organization will be fairly impactful in 2014. The in-home assessments that we've done will positively impact our MRA revenues that we have experienced as an organization. So that's new add. The funding, the CMS will conclude whatever that is, but there'll be a current year, an amount. There'll also be a prior year catch-up that will be a part of that calculation. The Stars that Bruce talked you through earlier and the work that we're doing there will be positive, that will offset that. There's lots of pluses and minuses, and they're all going to be market-by-market. And so when we look at it, we calculate something that's kind of flat to slightly down. And when we look back at what we've been able to accomplish as an organization year after year, we feel fairly comfortable that we'll be able to address this situation and, again, grow and make a fair profit for 2014.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think one of the aspects that we do see that as a difference between the calculation is the premium tax included in it or not. Obviously, from our perspective and what Jim is referring to, the premium tax is not included in the calculation when we talk about being flat or slightly down.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And so just to clarify, you're expecting the generalized 45-day notice to everybody being flat to slightly down and then you named off several Humana-specific items that would improve your, say, Humana adjusted rate experience. Is -- am I interpreting that correctly, or is it that you think your Humana rate will be about flat?","James E. Murray","That's correct. The first point that you made is the correct way to interpret what I just walked through.","Bruce D. Broussard","And I think, in general, for historical purposes and as we look in the future, the 15 Percent Solution, the continued migration to our members to the integrated delivery model, our focus on our productivity around our cost side are all examples of how we are dealing with a flat to declining rate in a market that does have increased cost.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And if I could ask my follow-up to Jim Bloem. On the capital front, your debt to cap still remains low among peers. Is it your expectation that you will, say, use your dry powder there for acquisitions to add to the integrated delivery model? Could we expect that you might step up on the share repurchase? Can you give us a sense on the capital side for uses of capital?","James H. Bloem","I think that -- well, if you look at the last -- what we've done the last couple of years, they're very instructive about how we look at the deployment of capital. So if you look at 2012, you can see that we did a lot more in terms of the integrated care model in terms of acquisitions, in terms of CapEx and in terms of strategic investments. But at the same time, we also increased what we gave to the shareholders in terms of cash dividends and share repurchase. So we basically purchased things that raised the value of the company. We bought maybe 3x to 3.5x more of those in 2012 than we did in '11, but again, we also gave $52 million back. And all of the things that we spend our capital on, I'd like to just make sure that when we do this, I think that everybody needs to think about how capital efficient we are in terms of being able to build out the integrated care delivery model and what we get for what we pay, because I think having to -- staying with a conservative financial -- with a conservative balance sheet and strong cash flow is what we need to do as we enter the next 3-year period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the HMO versus PPO, and just ask a question around the targeted margins that you look for in those 2 product areas relative to the 5%. Are you targeting a 5% margin for both of those products, or do you target something higher for HMO, given all the structural advantages that you've highlighted, and something lower for PPO products?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. No. We don't target a different margin for PPO than HMO. We tend to target an overall 5% margin, as we've spoken to. And at the end of the day, if the HMO model, being a more efficient model, we're able to offer richer benefits and have a better value proposition in many cases. So -- but we don't explicitly target a lower margin in the PPO product.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just wanted to ask, just a follow-up, just an update on thoughts on the level of exchange participation for 2014 and if you're comfortable giving us sort of a range of the number of exchange markets that you're thinking about participating in.","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim Murray. I think in our Investor Day presentation, we suggested that as many as 10 markets we'd participate on the individual exchange. One of the things that we found out since we were together in November is that in order to participate on the individual exchange, we'll also have to participate on the shop for the small group. And so that will cause us to change some of what we were thinking around the small group participation on the exchange to work collaboratively with our HumanaOne businesses to figure out where we're going to go state-by-state and market-by-market. But other than that, it's probably in the 10 range, 10-state range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you don't like to generally comment about the market-by-market results. But given the attention there's been in Florida, I wanted to see if you were willing to comment on the Florida Medicare loss ratio in 4Q and\/or what the guidance for 2013 embeds.","Steven E. McCulley","No. This is Steve. I don't think we have any update for you on the Florida 4Q MLR. I don't have that. But as we've said, there's a number of things that go into the calculation in '14 with respect to the MLR minimum, including the deductibility of taxes and other things. So I really don't have an update for you. I think we've talked about that in the past.","James E. Murray","We've done a lot of scenarios that would suggest that there's some amount of exposure there as the 2014 regs go into play but nothing that is not something that we can handle and deal with.","Steven E. McCulley","And we still don't have the final rules yet. So once we get the rules and we're able to do a more in-depth analysis, then I'm sure we'll have an update.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then separate follow-up. On the Retail Medicare business, do you have the numbers in terms of gross adds for '13 relative to attrition, and how those numbers compare to the final 2012?","James E. Murray","Are you talking about the total for the year of net adds?","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. So if you think about the up 100,000 to 120,000 guidance for '13, what did you grow on a gross basis? What did you lose in attrition to get to that 100,000, 120,000?","Regina Nethery","We have them here, Carl, so we may have to come back to that in just a second. Let us just get the right piece of paper in front of us. But -- so -- wait, here we go.","James E. Murray","Total sales for January of 2013 or for the AEP were new sales of about 270,000, which was pretty close to where we were for the 2012 and 2011, for those of you who are interested in new membership. And then the terms were about 172,000. That gets you to around that 83,000 net, I believe, after you factor out the Arcadian adjustment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow on Carl's last question. So when you look at some of the dynamics of the terminations, are you finding any different trends in that cohort versus the renewals outside of product type?","James E. Murray","You're talking about Medicare Advantage information. We're not seeing anything significantly different in terms of the individuals who are terminating. We were a little bit more conservative with our benefit designs and premiums this past year, and so our terminations ticked up a bit, which we expected and we guided to. But nothing unusual in terms of who's terminating and -- or why they're terminating that was a surprise to us. So it was very close to...","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Maybe if I can phrase it a different way. If you were to look at those terminating members, were they in the geographies where you put forward some of the more material benefit design or price changes in '13 compared to what the product looked like in '12?","James E. Murray","That's probably a fair observation. And as we rolled up our anticipated guidance, we look market-by-market and we evaluated what our benefit design changes and premium changes were. And frankly, we came right on where we had originally thought we were going to be. So that's probably a fair evaluation. Where we were a little bit more onerous with benefit changes and premiums, we probably got some more attrition.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then to follow up on another earlier comment. You said that MLR targets for new members were down 300 to 400 basis points versus last year. So what is the target now, and how long does that take to get to a run rate MLR?","James E. Murray","Yes. I think I said 200 to 400, and we're not wanting to share with you what our new member target is. And I think what happens over a period of about 3 years, it gets down to our ultimate target of around 85% to 86% MER. That's what historically we've been seeing in terms of improvement after that first year of new membership.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Last question here is on the minimum MLRs. Do you have any insight on whether or not that's going to be state or contract level? And can you confirm if it's looking like we're going towards a rebate or just a prohibition if you miss it for a certain number of years? And sort of how far that prohibition would stretch?","Steven E. McCulley","Sarah, this is Steve. We still don't really have any insight on that. We're waiting for the regs just like you are, so.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Melissa McGinnis from Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","At your Investor Day, you had disclosed that 29% of your enrollment was in the non-aligned physician structures with cost structures that run at 29% of fee-for-service, and a lot of people wondered about the sustainability of that against reimbursement going to parity. But if we were to break down that bucket of enrollment at more of a micro level, would the majority of it be in counties where the benchmarks are actually going to a 95% or 100% of fee-for-service? Or in some cases, are the benchmarks in those counties at 107% or 115% where that cost structure might, in fact, be sustainable?","James E. Murray","This is Jim. In addition to the 91 likely improving over time as we do better against the 15 Percent Solution, there's really no concentration in any one of the 4 quartiles. We're seeing different results in different parts of the United States that I wouldn't say that there's any particular takeaway in terms of how much the payment rates are in those particular counties. It's more a factor of our ability to get rates from the providers that we work with in those locations and our ability to put some of the utilization metrics in place like the nursing resources that we talked about a moment ago. It's really not as much a quartile rate driven as it is our ability to touch the members on a regular basis and manage them going forward.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think that was the last question. And so, first, I would love to thank the associates for all their help and the -- and continuing to ensure the success of our organization. And of course, I would like to thank you, our investors, for supporting us during this past quarter and for the upcoming year.","You guys have a great day and look forward to seeing you at some point in time in the future.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Regina Nethery, you may begin your conference.","Regina Nethery","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Humana's senior management team will discuss our second quarter 2013 results, as well as our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. Participating in today's prepared remarks will be: Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Bloem, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts.

For those of you who have company firewall issues and cannot access the live presentation, an Adobe version of the slides has been posted on the Investor Relations section of Humana's website.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Finally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $2.63 per share, above our previous expectations for EPS in the range of $2.40 to $2.50. These better-than-anticipated results were primarily driven by strong operating performance across our business units, partially offset by an accrual for expenses associated with Humana's upcoming exit from Puerto Rico Medicaid business.","Our second quarter's solid operating performance reflects the continued focus and executional discipline involved in the key initiatives, like our chronic care program, including increased care management professional staffing and clinical assessments. The favorable outcomes seen from these programs year-to-date reinforce our commitment to the related planned investments in the second half of 2013. We believe maintaining momentum on those and other key capable building initiatives, together with our focus on operating cost efficiencies, will effectively position Humana to face the reform-related challenges that accelerate in 2014.","This morning, we raised our full year 2013 earnings guidance to a range of $8.65 to $8.75 per share, from our previous EPS guidance range of $8.40 to $8.60, reflecting the outperformance achieved in the second quarter. Jim Bloem will speak more fully to our second quarter results in his remarks. For this morning's discussion, I'll focus my comments primarily on our Medicare positioning for 2014, our integrated delivery model, the build-out of our dual-eligible capabilities, the work we have underway around health care exchanges and our enterprise-wide focus on return on invested capital.","Let's begin our Medicare positioning. We submitted our 2014 Medicare Advantage and Part D plans' designs to CMS in early June. The CMS review process is underway, and it appears to be moving along well. The course of our bid preparation for 2014, we took our standard approach of having a multidisciplinary team evaluate markets individually, allowing all the areas of their expertise to weigh in on the many variables that impact each local market. We believe the favorable outcomes of our clinical programs facilitated our effective development of plan designs that reflect our strong pricing discipline and a focus on margin. We expect these plans will be competitive and continue to offer a solid value proposition for Medicare beneficiaries.","Another implication of the good work done through our clinical programs is that we anticipate only modest plan withdrawals in 2014. Approximately 78,000 or 4% of our individual Medicare Advantage members will not be offered their current Humana plan in 2014. Less than 6,000 of those members will not have another plan, Humana plan, for which to choose from for next year.","Consequently, we continue to anticipate growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership in 2014. That said, the funding pressures from CMS are still quite onerous. Facing these ongoing challenges makes continued investment and execution discipline, particularly for our integrated delivery model, all the more critical moving forward.","Turning next to our integrated delivery model, I'm pleased to note that we continue to make steady progress here. Providers are continuing to move across the engagement continuum. The number of risk and path-to-risk providers has risen approximately 30% when compared to this time last year, and path-to-risk providers are up 20% year-to-date. Improvement in the quality experience for our members is a key element of our integrated care delivery model. When the member is highly engaged, both the member and the member's physician are working jointly to proactively identify and address health issues.","As you'll see on this slide, bonus year 2014 HEDIS scores on highly engaged members averaged 4.14 versus 2.77, where the provider is not aligned to our integrated delivery model. This is particularly important for historic quality rate rankings. Ratings for bonus year 2015 are due out this fall.","While year-over-year improvement is difficult to predict with specificity, we anticipate our contracts will have achieved continued progress towards the coveted 5-star quality ratings.","As a reminder, approximately 40% of our Medicare membership is in plans with ranking of 4 stars or higher for the bonus year 2014. As we more fully develop all the capabilities of our integrated delivery model, we intend to leverage those capabilities across all our customer segments. We are also leveraging these capabilities to take advantage of the opportunity to expand our services to the dual-eligible population.","As I've said in the past, the dual-eligible opportunity is a strategic area of focus for Humana. Key capabilities in assisting states with growing health care costs include effective relationships with state and federal agencies in care management programs, particularly those related to chronic conditions, pre-65 Medicaid management, behavioral health management and long-term care management.","Over the past 18 months, we've executed on a strategy of leveraging our care management programs for our over-65 Medicaid members, while partnering with CareSource on the pre-65 population. The strategy has been successful in proposing solutions to states deserving a full-service benefit offering, while leveraging Humana's strong care management capabilities.","We recently announced our intent to purchase American Eldercare, broadening our portfolio of capabilities to include long-term care management, or aging-in-place, services for Medicaid recipients. This transaction also makes us well-rounded offering for the states.","Since long-term care accounts for a significant portion of Medicaid benefit spending across the U.S., we anticipate this will provide us much opportunity for growth over the next several years. Though the terms of the transaction were not made public, I'll share with you that the cash expended to be used in closing this deal should not impact our ongoing share repurchase or cash dividend activity.","The dual-eligible business is clearly complex. Our partnering and acquisition activity is helping us to streamline that complexity. While pricing negotiation with various states are still underway in many cases, we'll maintain the appropriate pricing discipline, particularly given that it is a low-single-digit margin business.","Our awards to date have been substantial. Revenues for dual-eligible and Medicaid awards, thus far, could potentially add revenues in the mid-single-digit billion dollar range over the next few years. Though the mix of lower-margin dual-eligible business with the higher-margin Medicare business will result in a decline for the retail segment margins over time, we anticipate the segment pretax results to expand nicely.","Turning now to health care exchanges. Our focus for the coming year includes 14 states with our existing HumanaOne footprint. We expect the exchange products to include primarily HMO offerings, with select market presence with each of the 14 states, ensuring we are offering a competitive and cost-effective value. The preparation process is tremendous, with short time lines for implementation. Nevertheless, our operational teams have risen to the challenge. Tactical plans for sales, enrollment and retention are well into the implementation phase.","We believe all this work will result in a measured entrance into the health care exchanges. These growth opportunities are expected to generally counterbalance from a risk perspective the 3 Rs: risk corridors, reinsurance and risk adjustment. We're also developing an expansive contingency plan since, as we've learned in the roll-out of the PDP in 2006, not everything goes as expected in these situations.","Our implementation of varying provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have already become effective is moving along well. We do not anticipate any material impact from the employer mandate provision that the administration has recently delayed. Finally, let me speak to our company's enterprise-wide focus on return on invested capital.","To clarify, this is an area that Jim Bloem and his team have had clearly in their focus for many years. In fact, with its strong organic growth, Humana is one of the limited number of companies in the S&P 500 who's ROIC has exceeded its weighted average cost of capital consistently for the past 10 years.","We believe this metric is particularly critical given the challenges the industry will face over the next few years. What's new here is that we are engaging more of our leaders across the company in this ROIC focus, as we believe it is a measure of shareholder value over the long term.","Earlier this year, we implemented the spread of ROIC over the weighted average cost of capital, as 1 of 2 measures in our performance share vesting, providing more widespread attention to the effective use of capital. ROIC compensation targets are not specific to the individual lines of business, but evaluated enterprise-wide to help ensure all our leaders use our capital judiciously. Our focus on ROIC has no impact on the Medicare margin targets we evaluate as part of our annual bidding process.","So in summary, we are pleased that 2013 results continue to come in ahead of expectation. Our strategy is on track, our business segments are delivering solid performance, and our execution focus is high. Despite near-term industry challenges, we believe Humana continues to have a bright growth future ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Bloem for the review of our financials.","James H. Bloem","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll first detail the quarter's results as well as our updated full year 2013 expectations before turning to our operating cash flows, financial resources and continuing capital deployment plans.","Starting with our second quarter results. We were pleased to report earnings per share of $2.63 per share, which exceeded the mid-point of our previous guidance by $0.18 per share, as indicated on the slide.","As Bruce referenced in his remarks, our 3 Puerto Rican Medicaid regional contracts, which cover 537,000 beneficiaries, were not renewed by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration effective July 1, 2013. Accordingly, we recorded expenses of $31 million, or $0.12 per share, during the second quarter in connection with the wind down of these contracts and related administrative costs.","Contractual transition provisions require the continuation of Humana coverage for beneficiaries through September 30, 2013, as well as the processing of runout claims for the terminated contracts.","Though we sought to renew these contracts, we were unwilling to accept the inadequate returns that would have resulted from their retention. We continue to have a significant presence on the Island of Puerto Rico, serving 34,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, as well as 72,000 Employer Group commercial members.","As also shown on this slide, our operating over-performance for the quarter was $71 million, or $0.28 per share, which in turn, allows us to increase our full year operating expectation by approximately the same amount. This over-performance mostly was due to a continuation of moderate medical cost trends in both our Employer Group and Medicare Advantage businesses.","With respect to our Employer Group commercial Medicare costs -- medical cost trends, we now see them in the range of 5% to 5.5% for the full year 2013. This represents only a modest uptick from 2012 levels. It's important to note that when we began 2013, we indicated that we were cautiously forecasting trends in the 6.5% range, plus or minus 50 basis points. We also have experienced favorable medical cost trends associated with the improved clinical program outcomes in our group Medicare business as well. Accordingly, we've raised our Employer Group pretax income guidance for the full year to a range of $250 million to $270 million, an increase of $60 million, or 30% at the mid-point, in order to reflect this more moderate cost trends in both our Employer Group commercial and group Medicare Advantage businesses.","We also have experienced favorable medical cost trends in the -- in our individual Medicare Advantage business. However, we continue to invest substantially in our chronic care capabilities with a focus on expanding the number of both care management professionals and clinical assessments to expedite the identification of members who would benefit from our clinical programs. We believe these investments generate deeper engagement with our members, which in turn, leads to improved health outcomes with a better consumer experience at a lower total care cost.","For this reason, and because of 3 other second half variables which we are continuing to monitor, we've chosen to leave our full year pretax income forecast for the Retail segment in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. The 3 other variables which we continue to monitor with respect to the Retail segment are as follows.","First, as always, we're awaiting the release of the Medicare Advantage competitor plan offerings, which annually occurs around the 1st of October. Evaluation of the 2014 competitive landscape will enable us to finalize our fourth quarter marketing plans in early October.","Second, we continue to monitor and ensure our readiness for the coming health care exchanges, since this remains a very dynamic situation.","And third, we continue to build out capabilities around our Medicaid and dual-eligible expansion strategy. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we will continue to expand our infrastructure in order to prepare for the ramp-up in this business, although again, the extent and timing also remain fluid as we work through the detailed rollout of these programs in the various states where we plan to participate.","Moving onto our health care services segment. These businesses are tracking in line with our previous forecast. And our pretax income guidance for the full year remains unchanged.","So in summary, we're pleased with this quarter's outperformance and have raised our full year earnings guidance to a range of $8.65 to $8.75 per share.","This final slide updates our 2013 operating cash flows, financial resources and continuing capital deployment plans. With respect to our operating cash flows, second quarter 2013 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles operating cash flows were $173 million, or $533 million lower than the $706 million we reported in the second quarter of 2012. There are 2 items which account for this significant difference, and both have already reversed in July. Here's the detail.","First, as is always the case, in addition to GAAP, we also evaluate our operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis in order to assure that exactly 3 monthly CMS payments are reflected in each quarter.","As shown in this morning's press release, in the second quarter of 2012, this non-GAAP timing difference was $118 million of that $533 million year-over-year difference.","Second, in addition to the monthly CMS payments, we also received semiannual Medicare risk adjustor payments around midyear from CMS. Since June 30, 2013, fell on a Sunday, while June 30, 2012, was a Saturday, the 2013 midyear MRA payment was received on Monday, July 1, 2013, while the 2012 payment was received on Friday, June 29, 2012. The amount received in each year was in the range of $450 million to $500 million. Thus, together, the timing of receipt of both the monthly and semiannual CMS payments fully explain this year's lower second quarter operating cash flows versus the second quarter of 2012.","Most noteworthy in all of this is the fact that, based on today's increased earnings guidance range and the July reversal of these 2 timing differences, we've increased our full year 2013 operating cash flows guidance range by $100 million at the mid-point, to $2 billion to $2.2 billion range.","From the standpoint of our current financial resources, we're pleased report that as expected, the approximately $970 million of 2013 dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which we detailed in the first quarter call, were all approved and received by the end of the second quarter. This amount is largely reflected in the $883 million of parent cash and short-term investments at June 30.","The $883 million balance is after payment of first half 2013 quarterly cash dividends to shareholders of $83 million and share repurchases of approximately $210 million.","Finally, with respect to our second half 2013 capital deployment plans, we expect to continue our constant review of potential strategic investments and acquisitions, such as the American Eldercare transaction, which Bruce described, as well as the capital projects that we're always engaged in. At the same time, we expect to consistently return capital to our shareholders through our recently paid and increased quarterly cash dividend and our recently refreshed 1 billion share repurchase program, of which $871 million remains available with a June 30, 2015, expiration date.","With that, we'll open the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christine Arnold of Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for the commentary on Medicare Advantage enrollment growth. How do we think about the margin? Because I mean, you bid assuming a certain loss ratio. And I know that the investments are something that could be fluid. How are you thinking about the loss ratio in 2014? And then is Eldercare accretive or dilutive? How do we think about that?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. On the margin targets, as Bruce described in his remarks, I think we were pretty consistent with what we've always done over the last number of years relative to our Medicare Advantage individual targets. And because of the significant investments that we're making as an organization, that we go out of our way to talk to you about it. I think we feel pretty good about how those are all playing themselves out in terms of the assumptions that we used to develop those bids. So we're cautiously optimistic about that. And as respects with the American Eldercare, I don't think that we're saying anything about accretion there. I think it's an incredibly important acquisition for us, and we'll see how that plays out. And we'll talk about that more probably next year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you said consistent with the past few years, you've consistently said that you targeted a 5% margin, but you kind of moved away from that after the latest bids and thought more about long-term return. So when you say you bid consistently with respect to the past few years, are you saying you're targeting the 5% margin?","James E. Murray","Well, one of the things we have to deal with, as you'll recall, is the premium taxes. And so we had to modulate what we targeted in terms of our margins. So I would have said actually, that we probably had a higher target -- a higher pretax margin relative to what we've done in the past to make up for that premium tax issue. And so, again, I feel very good about the bids that we put out there. They're going to competitively allow us to, as we said in this morning's release, grow our Medicare Advantage individual business next year. And I feel very good about how it's playing out, as you see with some of the reporting that we did with respect to our trends this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First of all, just maybe to drill down a little bit more on the MA plan withdrawals. So the 78,000 members affected, can you give us any more flavor for how concentrated that is geographically or other inputs that led to your decision there?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray again. I don't have the specifics on exactly where they were located. But I would tell you that it would be my opinion that those were probably in areas that weren't very highly concentrated and in parts of the United States that probably we don't have what we would call bold-moves focuses for us as an organization. And in a lot of those, as is indicated in Bruce's remarks, and I think the press release, we have other options for people to choose, which we think are fairly close to those that we had to eliminate. So that the ultimate impact was, I think, 5,700 people throughout the United States. And so we feel really good about that.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think it's really important because the team worked really hard to try to ensure that we offered a plan to as many of our members as possible. And I think this is -- it's better than what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year. But I will tell you, there's a lot of work that's been done to make that happen.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe my other question would relate to your comments about the exchanges. I think, Bruce, you mentioned that beyond the 3 Rs, you had some contingency plans that you're looking at in case things didn't go as planned, as they often don't in a situation like that. I wonder if you could expand on that. And also, I don't know if you could say anything about this. But as you gear up and think about these 14 states, can you -- is there any way to put any parameters around what would be a surprisingly good number of enrollees that you might pick up and sort of a bandwidth around what could happen, given your product offerings in those 14 states that you're anticipating?","Bruce D. Broussard","The latter question, we're not going to disclose that. I mean, we're -- it's a pretty fluid environment we're in right now. And I think just managing for what comes to us is the approach we're going to have. In regards to the contingency plan, we went into the bidding process and really were thoughtful around, actuarially, how we would approach this. And I think, as you look at the bids in each of the states and\/or pricing, we're pretty much in the middle of the line here, not too aggressive and not at the lowest end there. In regards to the plan in my comments, it really comes down to systems around the, really, the implementation of the exchanges. And I just would say that we have a very good system back-up in a lot of different ways if something doesn't work. So it doesn't relate to the risk management side or relate, from a financial point of view, it really relates to the operational management.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","With respect to some of your Medicare exits, can you talk a little bit about the level of retention or switching into other Humana offerings that you could anticipate in the counties where your products are being discontinued? And then, as far as strategy goes, how much of your individual membership is in 0 premium plans for '13 and, thinking about plan design changes for '14, how could that change?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray again. The -- I think we referenced 70,0000-ish folks that are in plans that we had to think about discontinuing. And we've been very successful. One of the assets that we believe that we have as a company is the MarketPOINT representatives that have an opportunity to sit across the kitchen table from the seniors that they serve. And they talk to the seniors about options and strategies. And as a result of that relationship that they've created, we feel pretty good about our ability to have a conversation with those 78,000 folks and walk them to a Humana plan that makes some sense for them. So I can't tell you exactly how many of those will retain, but I would tell you that we probably feel pretty good about that. And your second question was?","Regina Nethery","0-premium plans for '13.","James E. Murray","I don't have it in my fingertips in terms of our 0-premium plans. But one of our philosophies is, and continues to be, to maintain as many 0-premium plans as is humanly possible. And obviously, as Bruce described when he went through his remarks, a lot of people get together every year as we're doing our bids and try to figure out, on a market-by-market basis, the dynamics, the investments that we're making, the trends, the -- all those things that we talked about so much in the past coming together. And we feel pretty good about our ability this past year to maintain that philosophy around the 0-premium plans. And you'll all see that in October.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And second question, if you could just talk a little bit about your decision to enter the Mississippi exchange, particularly in the 36 counties with no competition, and how risk adjusters might work in that situation.","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, first thing is considering the population there, it was the right thing to do, I think, for us to go into that marketplace and to offer the insurance on the exchange side. In regards to how we approach it, it is a market that, since there will be only us in that marketplace, it does offer the ability to have a fairly reasonable rate there. So we look at that as an opportunity for us to protect ourselves. And then, in addition, we do have members today in that marketplace, both from a TRICARE point of view, we have a pretty significant membership base there, and then in addition, we have a Medicare membership base there. So we are going to an environment that we already are operating in. And so we feel comfortable with that. And then, at the end, we always said the 3 Rs will help us out in that particular aspect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to next year again. Did you -- where you're exiting or eliminating plans, is it mostly on the PPO side or is it a mix between HMO and PPO?","James E. Murray","This is Jim again. The -- by far and away, the most would be in the PPO space, which is, as we've talked in the past, our desire over the long haul is to get as many members and providers participating with us in HMO plans because they offer the best opportunity for us to provide economic value to the people that we serve. So that's what's happened in these markets that we haven't been as successful moving into the HMO kind of environment. So I would say most all of them were PPO.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just with regard to the employer segment results we're seeing this year. Obviously, doing better than you originally anticipated. Is the improvement entirely due to trend or is there some structural improvement that should help you longer-term here get that margin up from that 2%-ish level?","Steven E. McCulley","Hey, Chris. This is Steve. I'll speak to that a little bit. The improvement is largely trend improvement. And a lot of that we're seeing in the inpatient admissions trend being more favorable than we had planned. Also, our operating cost ratio, we're focused on making that better as well. And we're having a lot of success on that as well. So the combination of those 2 things are making the results better. And I do think the operating cost ratio is part of the infrastructure that will continue to run into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question about -- it sounds like you have sort of investing in the clinical management side of things and trying to shift the types of products that you're selling. To the extent that you're doing that within your product categories and I guess exiting PPOs and trying to get people into HMOs, can you give some thought about how you feel comfortable about seeing membership growth, since you're asking your consumer to kind of embrace a product which is, I guess, different than they've had in the past, and what experience you had doing this on other markets and how people responded to that?","James E. Murray","I think -- just to clarify something, when we talk about investing in our clinical programs, right now, it's a lot around our chronic care program. And our chronic care program has really shown some wonderful results, as evidenced by some of our over-performance this year. And as we look at that program, that is -- it has a lot of applicability to the PPO product. And that PPO product, adding that service is actually a very nice add to that. So it's not asking our members to do something that it is a choice. Meaning, that they're giving something up. It's actually a great add, and we have gotten just wonderful reviews back from our members on the effectiveness of that program, both from a lifestyle point of view and then, obviously, from a health point of view. So from our vantage point, it is actually a great service for our members, but it is primarily offered in the PPO product.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","[indiscernible] I was just going to say, that's interesting. But I guess, it would decide [ph] there's just the physician engagement side of things, which to me, at least, implies more network products.","James E. Murray","Yes. And the other thing that I would have added to Bruce's remarks is you -- and I think you see it in our stats. One of the things we do is not only try to get a model or a chassis built that features the HMO offerings, but we also try to sell people an HMO offering that may not have the full risk elements of it that we've talked about in the past. And so, that's a dual focus for us to try to get people to align around our HMO philosophies, and we've been pretty successful. I think we have about 50% of our folks in the Medicare Advantage individual business in HMO kinds of offerings, which is a good first step. And one of the reasons that I would opine on that that's happening is because people are used to those kinds of things, because they've grown up with their employer having HMOs and PPOs. And so, we don't see that that's a very difficult sell, and we've been fairly successful with that.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, I just wanted to sort of understand a little bit more the return of invested capital thesis and how you guys apply that to your decisions to grow a certain business lines because you mentioned that the duals are going to be a lower than average margin business, which, to me, implies a lower return on invested capital, potentially, profile for that business. And then maybe the exchanges you target could also be a lower margin business as well. So how do you think about growing those businesses or even think about getting into Medicaid in a bigger way if those potentially have lower returns?","James H. Bloem","Yes. Kevin, it's Jim Bloem. Again, as Bruce referenced, we've been using this tool for a long time and have had great results with it in terms of consistency and the use of capital. But now, if you look at the last slide in Bruce's presentation, you can see those 17 businesses that are in the outer ring there, they're all different businesses and they all got different economic. They all require different capital. They all generate different returns. So the return on capital model, what that does is, it helps the company focus on, really, if you will, asset allocations and how we're going to make decisions and move capital around between those different opportunities that we have. And that's why we're bringing it up and we're making it -- giving it wider application throughout the management team. We're always, again, very dedicated to using it. But when you have a lot of different businesses whereas before, you go back 3, 4, 5 years ago, we were really in sort of a monolithic business that had capital requirements and returns.","Bruce D. Broussard","And related to that, you're asking specifically around the dual-eligible population. And the margins are less, but the actual dollar per case is much greater as a result of the conditions that, that population brings to needing services. And so, what we look at it is the absolute dollars that comes to the bottom line are much greater. And so, we look at that as a good returning business. The exchanges are a little different. They're smaller dollars, but there's less capital to be put up as a result of the less premium there. So the -- so we -- but those are great examples where the margin is impacted. But both for strategic reasons and for long-term returns, it's a good business to enter into.","James H. Bloem","And that's why we do it on a corporate wide basis, so that we can look at how does the -- how do all these things individually contribute to the whole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake of JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is on capital deployment. So with the rate pressure in Medicare Advantage making operating earnings growth more difficult the next couple of years, I want to get an update in terms of how you're thinking about the company's ability to deploy free cash flow and the under-levered balance sheet accretively to cushion EPS over the next couple of years.","Bruce D. Broussard","Go ahead, Jim.","James H. Bloem","So, Justin, I think, basically, we would look for the same kind of consistency that we've had in the past. We're always working every day to figure out how we can make the company more valuable by -- through acquisitions, by investments in capital programs, investments, et cetera. To the extent we have that and then we also foresee, as you -- as your question points out, that there are some headwinds in terms of the premium tax and the returns that we're going to be able to generate in the initial part. So if we're looking at that -- as we look for growth, then we look at the capital that we need after that. So if you look at -- we talked a lot today about what we're going to do in the Medicaid and dual-eligible programs. So that will require -- that will generate a lot of revenue. And that revenue will again require, from the states, a capital requirement that we'll have to satisfy. So our under-levered balance sheet, while it's more levered than it was last year, I want to make sure that everybody understands also that the rating agencies -- the credit rating agencies give us the flexibility to go up in the 25% to 30% range without jeopardizing our credit rating, which, again, S&P raised in the past quarters or in the past few days as well. So we want to make the company more valuable. We want to protect all of our optionality that we've developed with the balance sheet and continue to move forward. Now when we look at what we've done, I think that's -- while it's not guidance for the future, it's quite consistent in terms of how we split or balance between that growth and then the capital that we return through cash dividends and repurchase. And again, for the first half of this year, about $300 million. Those -- the total for those things for the last 2 years, $600 million for the full year. The 8 quarters that are left on the $871 million that's left in share repurchase, again, would indicate a rate per quarter, if you're going to do it that way, that would be very similar to what we've done for the last 2.5 years. So again, it's all a matter of continuing to look -- as we progress to look at all of our capabilities, what we still need. American Eldercare was a great acquisition for us. Again, thinking about that, thinking about those 17 companies that are on the left of Bruce's slides are very capital-efficient way to get those capabilities. So that's what I think we'll continue to do as we go forward.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And my second question is for Jim Murray. Jim, just following up on Christine's question, can you give us an idea of what the industry tax and the lack of deductibility means in terms of rate for Medicare Advantage? Am I right thinking it's like 70 or 80 basis points?","James E. Murray","I think that's a fair estimate. Yes, somewhere in that range.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So in response to Christine's question, you said you took up the operating margin in the bid because you had to -- well, obviously, in order to offset the lower -- the impact of the 70 to 80 basis points. Is that right?","James E. Murray","We raised our pre-tax margin targets to account for the impact of the premium tax. That's correct.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if we start at 5% and we take out 70 or 80 basis points and we say that's the floor, and you actually took it up. Is it fair to say that, after the industry tax, the minimum after-tax margin that you would -- or, I should say, the minimum margin on a comparable basis would be like 4.3%, give or take, and it might be even better given the fact that you said you offset some of that industry tax? Is that a reasonable floor to think about?","James H. Bloem","I think the best way to think about it is -- you point out and again, this is exactly the way we think about it. We have 3 things we have to deal with in 2014 bids. We have to deal with the trend, we have to deal with the payment rate and we have to deal with the premium tax. We have 7 things we could do to handle those things. And in every market, as Bruce and Jim have described, we basically use those, although there's no algorithm or way to do it, we think about it individually. And I think, as Jim said quite rightly, that's one of the key competencies of the company is that, by market, we individually do these 7 different levers, everything from how much can we push back to the providers, where are star ratings, what are our trend benders, how much -- what can we look for in terms of competition. But in order to really see how this all turns out, we have our internal target, which is sort of our secret sauce. But until you see October and until you see what the other people have done in each of these places, and that's why the next call is the one that we're looking forward to, when we get all the information and so are you. That's really when we think this comes together in a way that really enables us to talk about this in the aggregate because we do it in the individual, but we don't have a real feel for the individual until we've actually seen the competitive offerings.","James E. Murray","And what I would add to what Jim just said is he talked about when we see everybody competitively in October, that will give us a sense for growth. But what, frankly, we're all looking at to make sure it continues and we're seeing that develop in the second quarter, as we've talked, is the beneficial effect of all of these investments that we're making as a company. To see how those are all coming together, we're making additional investments that we're feeling good about, but there's a lot of blocking and tackling that has to go on between now and then, and we want to feel better about those. So we can put all of this on a sheet of paper, and it can produce a number. But it's the day-to-day activity that creates the result that you're all looking for us to talk about, which we'll be more than happy to talk about next time we're together.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I want to concentrate on the 99% of your book that you're maintaining your products for your customers. And so, I guess, I'm curious. Is this indicative of a belief that there's a long-term sustainability of those product offerings, i.e. you won't expect additional market exits? Or will you evaluate things every year? And with the expected additional pressures into '15 and maybe even '16, there could be future exits? Or how do we think about that?","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, we always -- I mean, we always want to stay in the market. So that's -- I mean, our #1 goal here is providing its profitable and meets the targets we have. I think as we continue to see rate pressure coming down, then we'll have to evaluate markets we're in. This year, for all the reasons that Jim has said on many different aspects of the 7 different things we can do, we really focused on how do we create stability in the marketplace, maintain our margin and, at the same time, continue to be successful in the clinical area. And those 3 things have really allowed us, I think, to be -- to find a very good, for lack of a better description, compromise for our members for the rates that are being given to us and, in addition, for our financial performance. And all the hard work comes down to managing through that. And so, as we see coming years, we're just going to have to go through that process. We\u2019re going to have to go through the processes. How effective can we be in our clinical programs like we have been historically. What markets we have concentration in and great relationships with providers and whether they're risk providers or path-to-risk relationships and what is our concentration of members in the marketplace from just size and scale. And those are the things that go into it. And the more the -- the bigger the rate cuts [ph] are, then the more we're going to lean towards markets that have better relationships with providers and more scale. And that's -- I don't know how best to answer the question more than that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, Bruce, maybe more specifically, if you were evaluating a specific product within a specific geography this year and you thought that you might be able to either -- I don't know what your metric is, it might be profitable and\/or it might meet the weighted average cost of capital -- the return on invested capital would meet the weighted average cost of capital for that specific product. But that equation doesn't work for '15 based on what you're seeing. Did you stay in that market this year? Or...","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes. But we would stay in the market, providing that we saw growth coming in that marketplace. In other words -- so I think if the market doesn't look like it's going to grow and be successful and we can't get the infrastructure in there to support that marketplace, then we would probably exit sooner than later. But for the -- so if you're asking do we just sort of go down and say, \"Where are we profitable?\" And if we weren't profitable, then we exit it no matter what the future was? Or if it was profitable and the future was sort of not a growth market, would we exit? And I think all of those things went into it. I do believe that our team went into this with the ability to say, \"Let's really look at markets that we have growth opportunities in both from a population growth, where we can be -- build successful clinical programs with physicians.\" And we can get those programs to the market as a result of our scale. So I would -- again, I come back to it. There's a lot of different variables going in there. But it does take a futuristic view of the success of that marketplace.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. So your impression is that the markets that you're going to remain in next year, all but 78,000 of those members that have to shift products, the remainder are in markets that, it sounds like, you feel like have a future beyond just 2014?","Bruce D. Broussard","Yes, yes. Unless we have some shock that comes out, then we'll reevaluate and go a different way.","James E. Murray","That's what all these investments that we continually talk about are all about. It's to enable us to do that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. Perfect. And then, I know it's less than 24-hours old. But the CMS release and the PDP benchmarks for next year, I know you know your bids and now you know the benchmarks. Any surprises in there? Any takeaways that you guys thought about?","James E. Murray","On the PDP side, we were under the benchmark in all states or all regions, except for 1 small region, where I think there's some de minimis things that will protect us. So we feel pretty good about that. A little bit of a surprise with how much the benchmark changed favorably to the government, which I guess is what this is all about. It's a market-based situation. But as we step back and look at our strategies and philosophies, I think we feel really good about having a competitive product on the street that we feel really good about going forward. So somewhat of a surprise. But generally, we feel good about what we've bid and where we think it will have us on October 1 or whenever we get pictures of all our competition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley of Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So we calculate roughly that your investments that you've called out and talked about are maybe $0.80 to $0.90 this year. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to comment how even philosophically you will see those continuing? Would you be able to taper those as we move out of '13 into '14, or is the level likely to stay about the same?","Bruce D. Broussard","I would say -- and then, I'll ask Jim to comment further. Those investments will be inherently in our operating performance going forward because they are expense and not just capital investments. Now what we will see, as we did see this year from last year's investments, that we will see returns from that -- from those investments from the point of view of lower medical loss ratio. That being said, we do believe as we -- the program to the level that we need to over the next 18 months or so, then we'll probably see a slowdown of the incremental dollars that we are investing today. So I would suspect that we'll see a slowdown over the coming years. Jim, do you want to comment any further to that?","James H. Bloem","Well, yes. And again, I think the way we look at is, as long as there's good returns and as long as they're helping get the better outcomes and the better consumer experience and the lower cost, we'll continue to do it. And there's still -- as Jim and Bruce have said, there's still a lot of ground to gain there. Lots of people to put into these programs and to identify for them. So again, we feel that it's difficult right now to say that there's a substantial diminishing of the run rate of the expenses because there's a payoff.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, coming back to MA, just to perhaps ask a question in a slightly different way. When you think about your growth for next year for Humana, the majority of your growth obviously comes during annual enrollment. I'm wondering if you do expect to grow doing annual enrollment for 2014, as well as picking up agents through the year. Maybe to parse out how you see the growth coming staged through the year, just as another way to ask the question, perhaps?","Bruce D. Broussard","Our anticipation when we talk about Medicare growth is that we would add membership beginning January 1 through the annual process. And then, in addition, we'll grow through the year with agents. I don't see us saying that we're going to have a dip or...","James H. Bloem","The pattern would remain as roughly the same.","James E. Murray","Yes. We have a target in mind for the full year that was a part of our bid process, and I think our MarketPOINT folks feel pretty good about it. And I wouldn't see that the pattern would change significantly from what we've experienced in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You didn't provide third quarter guidance, as you normally provide the upcoming quarter. Is there any reason for that this time?","James H. Bloem","Peter, basically, what we did when we looked at it this year, there are a lot of things that are still in motion for 2014. And as you rightly point out, we normally do provide quarterly guidance. But in looking at what we still have to do, as I mentioned in my remarks, we still have -- we're still building the Medicaid and dual-eligible strategy. We're still looking at the exchanges. We have the marketing that -- which is -- that's the only 1 of those 3 that are -- that is the same as last year. So we thought -- just as a way of thinking about how we give guidance at this time of the year, normally, we give you the third and everybody solves for the fourth and it just sort of sets up an artificial barrier that when we get to the fourth, we sort of have to say, well, how did we ski through the allocation between those 2 quarters. So we thought it would be just better to say, at the midpoint, we think we'll earn $3.12 for the second half and just kind of leave it there. It's really not more complicated than that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, last year, you spent an incremental $46 million -- I think the number was -- on clinical programs, and you were hoping to get sort of a $300 million return out of that this year. Can you give us an update on how that has performed? Have you gotten to those kind of levels of return? And then, in terms of the incremental spend this year, how much is it and then what do you expect to gain for next year?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. We have teams of actuaries that are a part of our trend committee process, and they regularly evaluate our spend on all of the investments that you referred to. And I'm comfortable that we've done a pretty good job of getting to the ROIs that we had anticipated when we made the dollar spend. Now obviously, some of that was part of why we saw the trend improvements. But I will tell you that trend always continues. And so, you just can't add $300 million of profit because it's offset to some extent by trend. And so, we're very pleased with how all of these programs are playing out and are very, very disciplined and diligent about making sure that, when we spend the dollars for all these programs, that it pays itself off. We watch it very, very closely.","James H. Bloem","And I think the objective evidence of that is the fact that, at least, in these first 2 quarters, we've substantially exceeded the guidance that we've given. And the primary reason is, again, the moderation of trends.","Regina Nethery","This is Regina. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte of Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","The question was about your strategy with regard to exchanges. Aetna, CIGNA, United, have been pretty defensive, and it makes sense with regard to their individual and small group exposure. The Blues and WellPoint are more offensive. Your strategy on both participating and then, generally, the pricing range seems a little bit more offensive. I'm just trying to understand. Is this related to your strategy as being a consumer company, or is it more about you being a senior company and you're going after the pre-65s. And is there any downside risk on adverse selection, if you choose to preferentially go for the 55 to 65?","James E. Murray","The -- I'm not sure that I would call us offensive or defensive. I think we feel really good about the networks that we've built in all of the places that we're going to offer products for this category of individuals. I would tell you that the way we talk about it is getting our fair share of that opportunity. And when you think about what we're building -- and we keep talking about investments and I apologize for that. We're creating a chassis on which we can use to care for all of the folks that we ultimately have a relationship with. And we see the HumanaOne folks that are going to come into our rolls as a result of this exchange opportunity. And a perfect example, they're all HMO-based. Some of them may, as you've seen some press about, some of them may have conditions that we need to focus on. But lo and behold, we're building a very solid chronic care capability. So all we plan on doing is using what we've been building for the Medicare business and apply it to HumanaOne. So that's why we feel pretty good about the 14 states that we've talked about entering, and I think we have -- we believe we have the clinical infrastructure, on which to address any of the concerns that some of you may have.","Bruce D. Broussard","I just want to add. You mentioned that because we're a consumer company, which obviously MarketPOINT IS going to be used in the -- in our exchange product. And so, we're leveraging that. But as Jim said, I think one of the capabilities that the organization really looks at in deploying into the exchanges is the clinical programs. And to us, that's where we are -- probably our sweet spot is. It's been demonstrated over the years in the Medicare program. And as we look going into this, that's probably where we'll see us being able to have the most impact on people's health.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So just, I'll just quickly recap, and I'll stop there. So it's not about pre-65s, and you're getting Medicare-like rates on an HMO chassis. Is that a fair assessment?","James E. Murray","Yes. I think what you're implying, and we do talk about this, is this is an opportunity for us to provide coverage to people for their lifetime. And so, this is a nice opportunity to create a relationship with somebody who is under age 65 and have them age into our Medicare programs. So if that's what you're implying, I would say, yes, that's a part of what we're thinking.","Bruce D. Broussard","And also have relationships with people that are already in Medicare.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to stick on the commercial individual and small group and just 2 questions there. One, are you seeing any evidence yet of small employers starting to drop coverage at all, ahead of 2014 at an increasing pace. It's just something that WellPoint had suggested on their call, but haven't heard many of the other plans confirming that at this point. Then, just second, just on the individual membership guidance, it looked like you bumped that up. Is that just more a function that the products' been growing better-than-expected so far this year, or are you now not expecting to see as much attrition in the back half of the year leading up to exchange open enrollment in October?","James E. Murray","On your small group question first. We're seeing some pretty nice growth in our small group business. In fact, there's a movement by a lot of companies to renew early, and we're seeing the beneficial effect of that. So that's actually been one of the areas of nice growth for us. So we haven't seen that occurring, perhaps, as one of our competitors that you referenced that. On the individual, frankly, I've been a little bit surprised. We actually thought that, on the individual business, that people would be holding in place until the exchanges came into view. And actually, what we've been seeing is that there's a pretty fulsome marketplace for that, and you're seeing the beneficial effect. We had actually thought, as our guidance previously suggested, we were going to go down and we're actually seeing some nice growth. And so, we tried to figure out what that might be all about. And I guess, the best thing that I've heard is that people are beginning to understand that they need to buy coverage. And so, they're making that choice now. But that's only somebody's guess as to what's occurring. So I don't have as much insight on that as I'd love to have for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a numbers question. One, if you still see the benchmark rate being down. I think you're pretty specific down 2.8% before the impact of the premium tax. And so, 280 basis points down. Secondly, should we think about the premium tax being about 1.5% of Medicare Advantage premium?","James H. Bloem","Oh, yes. The answer to both questions is yes.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. Got it. And just one other, if I could slip this in. Can you talk about directionally where you think you'd be on after-tax margin going into 2014? I mean, I appreciate the commentary on pre-tax margin. But of course, as you guys know very well, it's less meaningful at this point going forward, given the impact of the industry fee.","James H. Bloem","Well, Matt, all I can tell you is you know that our tax rate is very consistent in terms of our statutory rate and our effective rate are pretty much the same. So it's really -- it's a derivative of the same question. So we really can't answer it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping if you could just remind us of your historical approach to new Medicaid contracts. I think the Medicaid plans have historically, generally assumed breakeven in the first 2 quarters and then normally come back 2 quarters later and say they're actually going to lose money. I'm asking in the context of American Eldercare and particularly thinking about, I think some of your comments in the past were maybe less than happy with some of the rates that the winning bidders were able to get on that long-term care RFP?","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, let me try to say this on 2 different ways. First, as we've articulated, we -- pre-65, we really are relying on CareSource to be part of that bid process. So they really are the entity that is bidding and, for the most part, taking the risk on that. And so, when you talk about the Medicaid contracts, historically, Kentucky being probably the poster child of that over the number of years. That would really come from the CareSource side. In regards to the long-term care aspect, the -- there's a few things there. First, there is a collar [ph] in Florida for the first year or 2 to get some experience behind us. And so, as we look at going into it over the next 12 to 24 months, there will be a lot of learnings from that. Although that what we have seen is that in the states that have done this, Tennessee being one, Arizona being another and there's a few regions in Florida that have done this, there has been a very strong success in being able to manage the expenses on the Medicaid side, specifically on the nursing home side. And it has both been good for the state and has been good for the participating organization that has done that. Because it's similar to other parts of Medicare Advantage, as a great example. Your benchmark is your existing cost structure, which that existing cost structure really doesn't have any efficiency. And so, what we see is, is when you're compared to that, you have a lot of opportunity.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Michael Baker of Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the American Eldercare. Are there any enhanced capabilities that you're getting through the acquisition, or is it pretty much just a way to get a ticket to the long-term care dance?","Bruce D. Broussard","No, it really added -- it added some capabilities too, to what we have. Some of the activities that they are doing, we actually were outsourcing at the time. And so, when we won the 3 contracts, we were outsourcing some of those capabilities. So it was very much of a strategic acquisition for us. As it was, it brought a great number of Medicaid lives to us in the elderly population, which Florida is a big market for us. So it both was a good business, but also a good strategic acquisition for us. And we think it is -- it really is a wonderful deal for us in multiple different ways and, frankly, for the state as a whole. I think our -- taking our capabilities and bringing that together with our market share in the market in Florida and, in addition, our chronic capabilities, I think everyone wins on this.","Well, I think that's it. We really appreciate, as always, everyone's support. And this could not have been a successful quarter without our 50,000-or-so associates working hard every day. So I thank them for all the work that they've done over the last quarter in making this a successful quarter. So thank you. And again, we appreciate your support.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Humana's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Regina Nethery, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Regina Nethery","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Humana's senior management team will discuss our third quarter 2013 results, our earnings outlook for the remainder of this year and our detailed financial guidance for 2014. Participating in today's prepared remarks will be Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Bloem, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Joining Bruce and Jim for the Q&A session will be: Jim Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; and Steve McCulley, Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. This call is also being simulcast via the Internet along with a virtual slide presentation. For those of you who have company firewall issues and cannot access the live presentation, an Adobe version of the slides has been posted to the Investor Relations section of Humana's website.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's Investor Relations website. Finally, any references made to earnings per share or EPS in today's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings per share of $2.31. I reiterated our full year 2013 earnings guidance of $8.65 to $8.75 per share. These solid results demonstrate the strength of our operations, even after consideration of the preliminary investment and start-up costs for our state-based contracts including dual-eligibles and the health care exchange business as we referenced in last quarter's call.","We believe our base business is sound and we're positioned moving forward, in large part, the results of the progress in our clinical programs over the last 12 months. All eyes are on the future, so that is where my comments will focus this morning.","We have some distinct challenges ahead. Funding and regulatory pressures, in particular, are significant. That said, we believe our strategic focus on our integrated care delivery model and operational excellence, as well as our expansions into state-based contracts and individual health care exchange businesses position us well for the growth and long-term sustainability. Our strategic intent is to continue to ensure affordability of health care by improving health outcomes. We believe our integrated delivery model strategy does just that.","To remind you, seamless integration of care delivery, the consumer experience and advanced data analytics comprise the key elements of our model.","Let's begin this morning's discussion with our Medicare business. The Medicare annual election period for 2014 has begun. And we are generally pleased with the affordability of our plans for beneficiaries, as well as our plans' competitive position across the country. Because of our tremendous cross-functional effort focused primarily on clinical programs, Stars quality improvement and operating cost efficiencies, we've been able to minimize the benefit and premium changes our Medicare Advantage members will experience for 2014, ensuring the program remains affordable. All of this despite next year's funding challenges, which include only a portion of the ACA-related payment cuts.","We now expect our combined individual and group Medicare Advantage businesses to grow in the range of 260,000 to 305,000 net members during 2014. This projection includes approximately 25,000 individual dual-eligible members from contracts with various states, most of which we expect to be assigned in the second half of next year. Make no mistake, addressing the 2014 Medicare Advantage funding shortfall, including the impact of the industry fee, is no easy task.","The clinical investments we've made over the last several years and a rigorous focus on operational excellence have enabled us to be in this position for 2014. As we look out further into 2015, we see many of the same headwinds we faced in 2014 compounded by the effect of the lower Star quality bonus payment associated with the sunset of the CMS demonstration despite our higher quality ratings. Clearly, the nearly 15 million Medicare beneficiaries who have chosen Medicare Advantage need stability and rationality in the Medicare Advantage payment process.","It seems counterintuitive to continue such a volatile payment environment for the Medicare Advantage program when it is the only solution that effectively demonstrates a proactive approach to both improving outcomes for Medicare consumers and controlling health care costs for the benefit of the Medicare trust fund. Our data show that for diabetes, congestive heart failure and a range of other conditions, we achieved better results than the Medicare original fee-for-service. That is why the continued success of our integrated care delivery model is so critical.","Our integrated care delivery model continues to deliver the results that provide positive health outcomes for our members on a number of fronts. For example, our transition program designed to facilitate a smooth acute care to post-acute or home care experience has resulted in a 30-day readmission rate, only 9% -- approximately half of what beneficiaries in the original fee-for-service Medicare experienced.","Enrollment of new members in our Humana chronic care program is up fivefold to date over last year. As of the end of the September, we have had nearly 250,000 members in the chronic care program and expect to reach 275,000 by the end of this year. Much of this increased enrollment comes from our advanced data capabilities, enabling the implementation of predictive models, which identify the individuals who most benefit from these programs.","Another measure of success of our integrated care delivery model is the progress we continue to make with our Star ratings. Our bonus year 2015 ratings now have us at an average Star quality rating of 4.0, up from 3.82 for the bonus year 2014. We have 18 plans or approximately 60% of our membership with ratings at least 4 stars, including 9 plans that have ratings of 4.5 stars. These measures reflect our strong focus on proactive care for our members and are expected to provide Humana a solid competitive advantage across much of the country in 2015.","We believe that the strength of our strategic focus on integrated care delivery will help us not only in the near term but also position us for further success as we leverage our integrated care delivery infrastructure across state-based contracts and health care exchange businesses.","This slide sizes the sector-wide potential associated with the growth businesses for Medicare, Medicaid and the health care exchange businesses. As a reminder, there are approximately 9 million dual-eligibles today, with 7 million of those having full Medicaid benefits. Furthermore, CBO has estimated that health care exchanges will ultimately serve approximately 24 million consumers across America.","As you can see, these are growth opportunities that are difficult to ignore, particularly given the assets we bring to the table through our investments we've made in our integrated care delivery model and the robust growth anticipated for these 2 populations. You'll note that as I talk through the next 2 slides that there is considerable geographic overlap between our state-based contracts and our health care exchange presence. That is by design and further builds upon the strong Medicare advantage and individual commercial presence we have in many of these locations today. We believe this will further enhance our relationship across the spectrum of health care consumers.","As a reminder, our state-based contracts include 3 subsets. First, beneficiaries associated with the dual-eligible demonstration projects. We currently serve nearly 300,000 dual-eligible beneficiaries who choose our Medicare Advantage plans in the open market over the past several years. Consequently, we have significant experience in serving dual-eligible members.","Second, Medicaid Services for the under 65, or TANF population. We generally fulfill these contracts through partnering arrangements with risks ceded to other parties. The third component of our state-based contracts is Medicaid long-term care support service, which is a newer business for us. We believe the acquisition of American Eldercare, together with partnering arrangements, position us to successfully serve these populations given the strength of our integrated care delivery model today.","We've experienced gratifying level of success with recent RFP awards for each of these types of services and have targeted our pricing to achieve modest underwriting gains. However, it is important to realize with the number of rewards -- awards that we've secured comes the need for increasing investment in the related infrastructure. These investments will generally precede their contract -- the related contract revenues.","Turning next to our individual health care exchange offerings, we also priced this business targeting a modest underwriting gains. We believe long term, the potential size of exchanges is significant opportunity for Humana, as it is aligned with our core capabilities in chronic care management, including accurate clinical documentation, effective networks and retail individual sales. In addition, it allows us to establish a relationship with Medicare agents offering the opportunity for easier transition to Medicare Advantage and improved health before becoming Medicare eligible.","The long-term exchange opportunity is currently being overshadowed by the issues with the federal enrollment process. These issues could potentially alter some of the assumptions around risk mix that we made as we priced our products, so our ultimate health care exchange membership have a higher severity mix than we previously priced. Our integrated care delivery model focused on serving members with chronic conditions, together with effective network design and the backup protection of the 3 Rs will help mitigate a portion of our claims' exposure.","Assuming a speedy repair of the enrollment process and that's a diverse mix of enrollees for 2014, we anticipate that our investments in the health care exchanges will abate in 2015 and at which time, returns on our 2014 investment will begin to be realized. Both the state-based contracts and health care exchange business require initial investments that are not insignificant. However, we believe such investment spending is targeted on businesses with growth and earnings potential, which lever our -- leverage our core -- our proven clinical capabilities, as well as being the most capital-efficient way to enter these markets.","Our discipline and commitment around return on invested capital will continue to drive the choices we make to provide long-term value for both our members and our shareholder value -- shareholders.","To summarize, this dynamic environment requires scale, clinical depth and engaging member relationships. In that context, industry pressures will only reward industry leaders like Humana while increasing the difficulty for less capable organizations. Our industry-leading capabilities are demonstrated through our forecasted 2014 core performance.","Our GAAP earnings per share estimate for 2014 of $7.25 to $7.75 reflects that much has yet to play out for the state-based contracts and health care exchange businesses and incorporates related investment spending and startup costs of between $0.50 per share and $0.90 per share. Jim will discuss this more fully in his remarks.","We continue to advocate for stable and rationality in the Medicare payment process. We believe our strategy is sound and our associates are highly engaged. We're resolved to deliver an experience for the consumers we serve that positively affects health outcomes, enabling a healthier life for our members and growth for Humana.","Before turning the call over to Jim, I do want to comment briefly on our CFO transition plan. Today, we announced that Steve McCulley will serve as our interim CFO beginning on January 1. Steve will serve in this capacity as we continue the search to replace Jim, who retires as CFO on December 31. Steve's experience, credibility as a trusted advisor and knowledge of our business will ensure confidence with our internal and external stakeholders during the transition and over the long term for our ongoing success. Jim has agreed to remain on as advisor to the office of the CFO and work closely along Steve during his transition. Please join me in thanking Jim for his 13 years of extraordinary contribution and Steve for his continued leadership.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our financial results and capital positioning.","James H. Bloem","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll spend the bulk of my time on our 2014 earnings expectations, as well as our capital generation and deployment outlook. But first, let's spend a minute on 2013.","As Bruce mentioned, our reported third quarter earnings per share of $2.31 reflects solid execution of our integrated care delivery strategy. We also continue to see favorable medical cost trends in all of our major lines of business, including greater-than-anticipated prior period development. As with each quarter, the prior year's gross development can be seen in the claims roll forward we provide in the earnings press release.","Our third quarter results also included higher-than-planned marketing expenses for Medicare Advantage and the health care exchanges, as well as continued investments in our clinical capabilities. Each of these investments is expected to provide better health outcomes for our members and solid long-term financial returns.","Our full year 2013 earnings per share forecast remains at $8.65 to $8.75, with our Retail pretax forecast being slightly lower than 90 days ago, while our Employer Group forecast is slightly higher than previously expected, each reflecting the 3 factors I just noted.","Turning now to 2014. The chart included in this morning's press release and reproduced on this slide provides an overview of how we view 2014 versus 2013. With our expansion into both the state-based contracts and the health care exchanges, we've widened the ranges around our 2014 guidance points in order to reflect the uncertainty and potential volatility arising out of the following 3 factors.","Number one, health care exchange membership levels and the risk mix of those who enroll. Number two, a potential shift in the timing associated with our state-based contracts awarded to date. Since our infrastructure build must be ahead of the related revenue streams, any delay in implementation of these contracts potentially would result in higher operating cost ratios. Number three, certain portions of these 2 businesses are new to us, thus, as we evaluate the investment related -- the investment spend range of approximately $125 million to $225 million, or $0.70 per share at the midpoint, the resolution of each of these factors ultimately will determine the timing and extent of our actual investment spend during 2014.","So as we roll forward from 2013 to 2014, we see core operating margins improving for the Retail segment with slight pressure on the Employer Group and Healthcare Services segments. Bear in mind that in order to take into account the nondeductible industry fee, we had to target a higher 2014 pretax margin than in 2013. In addition, the Employer Group operating margin change also includes an expectation that medical cost trends will move up approximately 50 to 100 basis points from the 4.5% to 5% trends we're projecting for the full year 2013.","Continuing down the lines of the same slide, membership growth, primarily associated with our individual and group Medicare products, also is expected to positively impact pretax earnings for both the Retail and Employer Group segments.","There are also 3 2013 items that are not expected to recur next year. They include between $0.40 and $0.45 per share of better-than-expected favorable prior period claims development, $0.19 per share in benefit from our first quarter litigation-related settlement with the Department of Defense and $0.12 per share in costs associated with our exit from the Puerto Rico Medicaid business last month.","To summarize, we experienced a 2013 net benefit of $0.50 per share from these 3 items, although the individual impacts are spread across several lines of business, as shown on the slide.","Moving to the second to the last line on the slide, the midpoint of $0.70 per share assumed in connection with the investment and startup spending is anticipated to be concentrated in our Retail segment businesses, since that's where both the state-based contracts and the health care exchange businesses are expected to be reported. The last line of this slide shows the $1.39 per share expected hit to earnings from the nondeductibility of the industry fee, which is projected to raise our effective income tax rate from approximately 36% this year to 46% at the midpoint in 2014.","Turning to the next slide. This waterfall format helps isolate the level of headwind from the industry fee alone that, that fee has put on 2014. The $3.57 per share shown represents the full income -- the full impact of the industry fee, including its nondeductibility. $3.19 per share represents approximately $800 million of net operating pretax improvements, which when combined with the $0.38 per share or $95 million attributable to projected 2014 medical membership growth, just offsets the 2014 total impact of the industry fee.","As Bruce said, achieving these net operating -- net operational pretax improvements is no easy job. However, we feel confident in our ability to execute and deliver on them. The primary drivers of our expected operational improvement include the following 5 items. Number one, trend vendor initiatives such as our Humana Chronic Cares Program and in-home care for our members. While investments in these programs during the last 18 months have showed solid financial returns, they, importantly, have also improved the overall health care experience for many of our members. As we broaden the reach of these programs and magnify their impact through the use of deeper clinical analytics and greater conductivity, we believe their beneficial effects on member health, clinical outcomes and costs will increase substantially in 2014.","Number two, we expect that the continued improvement in our Star quality ratings will further streamline medical costs while also ensuring a consistent quality experience for our members. Number three, further medical services organization expansion, as well as strengthened alignment and integration of our risk-sharing providers, all 3 of which contribute to the continued growth in our HMO business.","Number four, operating cost improvements as we continue to streamline our work processes and increase our leverage over a growing membership base using a stable operating platform. And number five, for our commercial business, we were able to pass through most of the industry fee based on pricing, thus minimizing its impact on that portion of our business.","So despite the significant headwinds we face in 2014, we're pleased that we're able to project the stability in earnings for our core businesses, after giving consideration to the 3 items that are not expected to recur next year, even though we do anticipate lower reported earnings per share next year, primarily, again, to the investments and startup expenses associated with the state-based contracts and the health care exchanges. Just as a reminder, as always, our earnings per share guidance excludes any future share repurchases.","Before I conclude, let's briefly turn to capital generation and deployment. As we indicated by our guidance, we anticipate operating cash flows will be strong again in 2014 based on the strength of our current lines of business. We anticipate subsidiary dividends to the parent company will be somewhat lower in 2014 compared to the roughly $1 billion remitted each of the past 3 years as we retain capital for growth in our state-based contracts and health care exchanges.","Having said that, our balance sheet remains strong and with our low debt to total capitalization ratio, we have significant financial flexibility and optionality for the future. So in summary, we're pleased with the financial report -- the financial results we reported today and firmly believe in our ability to execute successfully around the financial projections for both 2013 and 2014 that we have outlined.","With that, we'll open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake from JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Before I start, just congratulations to Jim on his retirement and to Steve on the interim CFO role. Hopefully, that term [ph] -- we remove the interim over some point going forward. So my first question is on exchanges and the Medicaid investment and earnings outlook. So I think there's a lot of confusion here in terms of the magnitude of this $0.70. I want to make sure we understand, maybe we can just drill down to what you're expecting for exchanges and Medicaid business from a net income margin perspective in 2014? Is it fair to say you're expecting that after these [ph], including these investments, you're expecting to lose money in both of these businesses?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray. Those investments signal that for those 2 businesses that we will likely lose money in 2014 to very different reasons for each of the 2 different businesses that we're getting into. But those investments are included in the administrative costs related to those businesses and some of the other medical expense ratios related to those businesses. And we can walk you through why in each of those, we feel the need to put up that investment. As it relates to the state-based contracts, you've seen us win a lot of contracts here recently. As we win more of those contracts, it requires us to invest in more people to deliver on the services that we're contractually obligated for. Things like care coordination and chronic management, long-term care support services. Hiring those people ahead of the revenue related to the individual contracts is a part of the investment spend related to the state-based contracts. As Bruce mentioned in his remarks, another element of the investment in the state-based contracts is some of what we're contractually obligated to, obviously, is to improve the cost structures related to those different programs. And we've looked at some of the assumptions that are a part of our pricing analysis. And obviously, we feel comfortable with what we're able to accomplish, but when you start that in the first month, obviously, you're not going to be as capable, particularly in some programs like long-term care that is new to us. And so we've prudently concluded that it will take some period of time for us to get up to speed on some of those. So those 2 pieces relate to the state-based contracts. As it relates to the exchanges, I will tell you, it's a lot related to what we see happening in the market place today that you're all very, very familiar with. There's a problem with the enrollment. And because of that, the likely enrollment that we'll receive will be changed from what we thought when we did our initial pricing. We're waiting for guidance from the government around whether they're going to change mandates, whether they're going to do things to extend enrollment periods. And so because of the -- what's happened, we've had to step back and say, \"Gosh, what could happen given the risk mix that might happen or come to us because of the confusion out there.\" And so we've stepped back and we've concluded that we need to be more conservative in our estimates related to the profitability of that line of business. And our estimate is part of the investment that we talked about here this morning.","Bruce D. Broussard","And Justin, just to add to that, I know our investors have really encouraged us to be active in the dual-eligible market. And I think over the last 18 months, we've had a strategy of building it as opposed to buying it. And I think in the long run, we will be much more successful and have a greater return to the shareholders as a result of our organic growth and the investments we're doing today. And I -- looking from the shareholders' point of view, I think Jim and his team have executed quite well in being able to win contracts. It's a sizable part of our -- could be a sizable part of our business in the short term. And we look at these investments in the dual-eligible side as just, as we say, it's right before the revenue generates as opposed to a long-term investment that we're making a bet on, we're just positioning the organization to service the business we've won.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So the -- so can you bifurcate for me then what is the operating margin assumed for the business? So it sounds like you expect you might -- even though you bid on exchanges to make money, given what's going on out there, you expect you might do worse than that. So is the investment spend or the investment spend include a negative margin or is there a negative margin in exchanges now embedded in guidance plus an investment spend?","Steven E. McCulley","Justin, this is Steve. No, I think the negative margin is part of the overall $0.70, so that's all -- that's an all-in number. And, again, in terms of long-term margins, as you know, we've talked about our ROIC and earning our cost of capital. And clearly, our expectation is to earn in excess of our cost of capital in these businesses. So -- and you know that the capital requirement in these businesses will be somewhere between, say, 9% and 12%, depending on the state and the HMO. So we will get to the target return, ultimately, in both these businesses. And then with respect to the number, both the duals investments that Jim talked about and the exchanges are both significant. I wouldn't say one of them is a lot larger than the other, just to give you a little guidance around the number. And obviously, the ranges around this number are pretty significant due to all the uncertainty with everything that we're talking about here. So you'll see pretty significant ranges around our individual membership guidance and our revenue guidance. And clearly, as we go through the next several quarters and even the next year, we'll continually update you on these -- on how we're doing in these businesses.","James E. Murray","And just to be clear, we feel very bullish about both of these opportunities, and that's why we've invested so dramatically in them. And Bruce showed you a slide in his remarks about where these ultimately could result. So again, we feel very good regardless of what's happening as we speak, in terms of the exchange opportunity.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just to put a bow on this, Medicaid is breakeven and then there's another, let's say, $0.35 of startup losses, is that the way to think about it? The margin itself is kind of breakeven and then you have $0.45 of losses, or is that not the right way?","James E. Murray","Justin, every time I answer one of your margin questions, I get yelled at after-the-fact. I think the guidance that we provided on the guidance sheet is what we'd like to ask you to look to.","Bruce D. Broussard","Justin, this is an important question, I know, for you. We are oriented to having industry margins in this business, standard industry margins. So as you look across the competitors, I don't think we'll be much different in that regard. I do think, because we're investing organically as opposed to buying, we're going to have a higher return over the long term. But the real key here is that we have a very big book of business that's going to come on over the next 18 months. And we have to prepare the organization to service that book of business. And therefore, we are -- I mean, that's what you see hitting the P&L is this preparation of the book of the business. I don't think we want to get into what the margin is in the first quarter versus second quarter versus third quarter. But we are targeting long-term sustainable margins in this business that are industry standard with the high return on capital because of our deployment is organic versus acquisition driven.","Operator","And your next question is from Joshua Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So on the $0.50 to $0.90, I'm curious, can you compare that to the investment spending that you guys had talked about in 2013, and then help us understand how much of that is going to be sustained, i.e., continued to be invested in 2015? I guess I'm just trying to figure out, are these costs sort of normal course of business because you're growing in new areas or are these really extraordinary costs that are going to fall off the P&L in 2015?","Steven E. McCulley","No, I think they're different, Josh. I think, number one, the investments we talked about in 2013 -- by the way, this is Steve. The investments we talked about in the first quarter were around clinical investments that we were making this year, and we've had similar ones the year before. But those clinical investments are enabling us to produce the results in the core business that we shared with you this morning for 2014. So that clinical infrastructure will continue kind of as part of the run rate. I think that was a reconciling item from what we originally started with in terms of 2013 guidance and where we ended up. But those investments are kind of building our infrastructure and become part of the core run rate that produced kind of the core business results that we shared today. When we look to the new investments that we're talking around, around these new businesses, they're clearly different. As Jim just described, we have a long-term revenue opportunity for both of these businesses that we are getting into. And with the duals business, it's largely startup costs. And as we get into year 2 and year 3 of those businesses, the margins will normalize. And on the exchanges, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty around that business that we wouldn't expect to have long term. So they're clearly different types of investments.","James E. Murray","And I'll just throw in real quickly that those investments that we're making on the core Medicare business are going to be ultimately utilized to service the state-based contracts as well as the Humana exchange business that we're going into. So we're going to leverage those across all of these revenue opportunities, which is also a really good thing for us.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So there may be some spending in '15 in terms of investments. But the cost that you're incurring in '14, you would not expect to recur these, the initial hiring and build-out to support these new businesses?","Bruce D. Broussard","That's correct. Or the other way to look at it is we will have revenue that will be offsetting those investments as opposed to having -- incurring the startup costs.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Bruce, as well. And then just in terms of -- you guys put up a slide around the pressure on Medicare Advantage rates going to 2015 as well, and I think that's helpful as we near or get closer and closer to February. But I'm curious if we should think about -- it looks like you guys are incurring sort of the worse year in terms of reimbursement we have seen in a long term -- long time. And yet, your membership is accelerating over 10% next year and your profitability, your margins look like they're relatively stable. Should we think of '15 as sort of, hopefully, Humana can do a similar thing or is there a cumulative impact here where '15 becomes much more difficult to sort of do that same -- have that same level of success?","Bruce D. Broussard","I think it's hard for us to comment on '15. I'd like to sort of stay away from that. Just we're 16, 15 months out from there, so I'd like to stay away. But your point is a good one from the standpoint of what you see in us being able to keep Medicare Advantage affordable is really a result of our investments, as Jim was referring to around our clinical capabilities. And I think as you look at the strength of the organization, the strength of the organization is around the clinical capabilities, specifically in the integrated delivery model. And being able to utilize that both in Medicare Advantage that has positioned us well and being able to have an offering that allows us to grow the membership and also, obviously, be able to absorb the cuts that have taken in 2014, it also positions us well to take advantage of the opportunities in exchanges and in the dual-eligible side. So I would continue to focus on the long-term success of Humana or any organization in this industry, whether you're in Medicare Advantage or any other industry-related, is that you need to have depth in the clinical capabilities.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One, I just want to clarify, so the underlying assumption around cost trend is in the 5% to 5.5% range, is that correct?","James H. Bloem","Actually, it's 5% -- 4.5% to 5% is what it was this year, and we're saying 50s to 100 basis points higher, so that will leave you in the 5% to 6%.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I'm sorry, 5% to 6% range. Okay, all right. That's fine. And then, I think this may be asked different ways, but -- so the core performance, when I look at it, just at the bridge, looks like core EPS could grow by sort of $1.40 or over sort of 15% off the 2013 type of base x obviously the industry tax and investment. I guess, one, is there anything I'm missing there in terms of looking at it that way in terms of a growth rate? And then, I guess, given sort of the levers that you were able to pull, your comfort level in sort of continuing to sort of grow the business and how you envision or think about the long-term growth rates over the next 3 to 5 years.","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. I'll take the first question. And I'm looking back to the -- I'm trying to follow your numbers on the growth in the core business.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think he added the $1.38.","Steven E. McCulley","A dollar...","Bruce D. Broussard","5 to 4.","Steven E. McCulley","Okay.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","$1 plus the 38.","Steven E. McCulley","Got it. I'm with you. Yes, so that's in terms of overcoming the industry fee, yes, that's correct. Yes, you're looking at that correct.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just the growth rate comfort?","James E. Murray","Yes, the comfort level. To Bruce's earlier comments, looking out farther with 2015 and the funding levels and the premium tax or the industry fee is ways off. But we feel pretty good about what we're able to accomplish in terms of our focus on the infrastructure that we're building around the clinical capabilities. And Jim Bloem referenced many of these in his remarks, the focus on getting people into our Humana Cares program, to address them at their home, going into their home and identifying things that we can do to put them into some of the programs that we have at Humana, and a lot of focus around how we can provide more touching of our members as time goes on. We feel it has benefited us this past year, and we're in the process of identifying those kinds of things that we need to focus on for 2015 and beyond. Obviously, the future growth potential for us is a function of what happens in Washington and the funding levels and we'll see how those play out. But we feel very good about our ability to control medical spend and improve quality for the people that we serve.","Bruce D. Broussard","I think just to build on the growth rate, as Jim was talking about, first, we assume a rationality in reimbursement going forward, and stability, because I think both for companies to invest and continue to advance the industry and be able to lower the cost of health care, you need to have a stable environment. But as you look at the end [ph] businesses that we are investing, and I really would like the investors to take away from this, we are investing in businesses that have a high degree of membership growth. And to me, when you look at individual exchange opportunities, the dual opportunity, the Medicare Advantage just from a demographic point of view but also from a penetration point of view, those are very high growth industries within our industry as overall basis. And I think as you look at the long-term growth opportunities for Humana, you should really look at the underlying businesses we're investing in.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations to both Steve and Jim. Question, your slide on Page 6 with the 2015 Medicare Advantage rate pressure of 4% or a little more than 4%, can you tell us what's in that number? How much is the incremental health insurance fee impacting that? How much -- and then what do you have in there, like recalibration and Stars, and is that the industry Stars or Humana Stars? Because Humana did much better on the Star program than the industry as a whole.","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. I don't have the exact figures in front of me. I do -- as I recall the demonstration project going away from the Stars is around a negative 1.5 to 2 range. And the industry fee, as you know, kind of goes up from about 1.3% roughly in this year to about 1.75% or so next year. There's a nondeductibility aspect of that as well so that's about a 45 to 50 basis point increase in the fee and -- something in that range. And then, so you can kind of calculate those 2 and see how much of that bar is due to those 2, and everything else is kind of just a forecast of what we think may be in the normal CMS machine.","Bruce D. Broussard","But I think it's the Humana Stars, not the industry Star that's reflected in that number. That was one of his questions.","Steven E. McCulley","That's correct.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk about the third quarter. It was a little bit lower operating expense. Did you move operating expenses into the fourth quarter? Because you talked about sort of higher operating expense in the fourth quarter from marketing and clinical spend. Or was that an increment based on where you were in the year, you pushed up the amount of marketing and clinical spend?","Steven E. McCulley","Let me make sure I understand your question, Peter. But I think there is more marketing spend in the fourth quarter versus, say, last year.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is it more than you had expected to have when we gave guidance before or did you just move operating expense from the third quarter into the fourth quarter?","Steven E. McCulley","No, it may be a little bit more, not a huge amount more, but it's a little bit more. And again, we're starting to ramp up a little bit for the duals expansion.","Bruce D. Broussard","The duals expansion, we're starting to hire folks.","Steven E. McCulley","That, too, so there's a little bit of that in there as well.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but in the $0.38 of membership earnings, is there any earnings from that -- positive earnings from that, from the duals, Medicaid or the exchanges, or is there negative impact from those 3?","Steven E. McCulley","No, I think that, that's mainly our -- that line item is mainly going to be our Medicare, our core business growth and all of the results from the duals are going to be down below in that investment number, is the way to think about that.","Bruce D. Broussard","Both the duals and the exchange in the investment number.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, I guess, the main question I want to understand is -- it's helpful to hear the operating margin being up but the industry fee, since it's not tax-deductible, I mean, is there a way to kind of think about this on an apples-to-apples basis of how you're thinking the M&A book being on an after-tax basis in '14 versus '13?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve. So I think if you -- gosh, I think what we did in the chart -- in the earnings chart that's in the press release is we broke out just the nondeductibility aspect of that. So I think you can kind of take the numbers we've shared with you and assume that there's an industry fee of around, say, 130 basis points to 135 basis points would be a reasonable estimate. And if you assume a tax rate of say 36% and [ph] change, then you kind of gross that up and calculate the nondeductibility of that. And so I think that -- I think you can kind of do that off the chart is the way I think about it.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The thing about the chart was that the chart just has like a 2.5% bigger gross impact than net impact, which is obviously different than what you just -- the math you just went through. Is that just because you can pass it through on the commercial but you can't pass it through on the Medicare?","Steven E. McCulley","Let's see. I'm not sure. I'll think about that. But I would say on the -- with respect to the fee itself, on the commercial side, largely, we were able to pass a lot -- most of that through. There may be some limited instances where because of the MLR minimums in our small business maybe are a little bit -- we could be a little bit stressed on how much of the fee and the tax impact we could pass through. On the Medicare side, we think of the fee as a new part of our cost structure that goes into the calculus of the bids that we do. And it had to go in there with the rates and everything else that we do. And we had to achieve, ultimately, the target margins that we've -- that we shared with you today. So kind of I think of them as being a little bit different, but I don't know if that helps.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, the retail MLR -- go ahead.","James E. Murray","We would say that when you put all of the industry fee and the funding changes and the secular trends on a sheet of paper, then you have to try to identify trend benders and other things that we do as an organization to offset the impact of those, all of which create our target -- go into creating our target margin. And so I would say that we were able to successfully pass through the impact of the industry fee to our Medicare book of business. However, explicitly sending a bill for that was not part of the equation, which is what happened with the commercial book of business.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. I guess when I look at the Retail segment MLR, the guidance for next year kind of brackets what you're talking about for 2013. But if we're saying that the fee is 1.3%, and gross up to, call it, 2%, does that meant that your MLR guidance is really on an apples-to-apples basis, 85 to 87 versus 84 to 84.5?","Steven E. McCulley","Yes, I'm not sure I follow that math, Kevin. I guess what I would do is if I look at the chart that's in the press release that rolls forward the EPS, in there is -- you can see the investments are in the -- and the exchanges and the duals are also all in that retail guidance. But in that, there's changes in core operating margins number. That's a positive $275 million. And in there, we also had to overcome the industry fee itself plus improve it by $275 million in order to hit the bottom line that's on the schedule. I don't know if -- and the nondeductibility aspect of that is over [indiscernible].","Bruce D. Broussard","I'm going to try to take this real quick and see if I can answer, maybe between the 3 of us, we can do this. What you see is in the benefit ratios that we have that you do see on the retail side us forecasting a range that does show a decline, that is really coming and highlighting the benefit of our clinical programs that are impacting the clinical cost of what -- how we're able to help ensure that we were able to keep the benefits and the premiums at a flat rate at the membership level. Inherent in that is that we were able to overcome passing the tax back because we paid for it with lower cost of the clinical side, so -- in the Medicare side. So it's a little confusing because we didn't really pass it back, we kept the rates the same, we kept the benefits the same, but we're able to pay for that through hard work, through our 15% solution. And you see that in the metrics in the -- on the benefit ratios that we have.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So maybe just the way to think about it is your comment that you feel like you were able to offset the industry fee operationally. All right. So then I guess, maybe just my second question would be that how do you feel about the membership growth that you're looking for? Because oftentimes when you see strong membership growth, it comes with potential issues on the MLR side. I mean, you're talking about, I guess, maybe 9% or 10% retail MA growth if you pull out the duals, which is about, I think, twice what CMS is expecting the industry to show. And most companies are talking about growing less next year than they did this year. You're talking about almost doubling it. I mean, how comfortable are you around the benefits that you've set and how you're positioned for next year versus what your competitors seem to have done?","James E. Murray","Yes, this is Jim Murray. We're very excited about our growth potential, and in large part, because of what happened to us in 2012. We went through that situation where we had the new member growth in 2012. And as we tried to understand what happened in 2012, we identified a number of initiatives that we should embark on, which helped, quite frankly, to get us prepared for this 2014. Getting people into programs faster and creating the analytical tools to enable us to do that is a big part of what helped to get to where we're at for 2013 and what we expect to happen in 2014. So because of what happened in 2012 with us and the new members that we got in 2012, we've developed a number of things that are part of our clinical program that we feel very, very comfortable with and are very, very excited about the growth potential that we've shared with you here today.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you help us understand how much operating cost improvement is part of your achieving your goals on the Medicare Advantage side, in particular. Is there any way you can help us sort of understand that in terms of how much percent, if this is accurate, you may be bringing down operating cost per member? And then I had a follow-up.","Steven E. McCulley","Matt, this is Steve. There's is -- it's not -- there's a little bit of operating cost improvement, as we've talked about. As we grow, we benefit from that scale. So I don't think we guide to that specific number, we guide to the segment in total. And -- but there is some improvement. I can't give you the exact number on that.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And -- no, I was just going to say, when we had come to visit you guys recently, correct me if I'm wrong, but I felt that you had hinted towards achieving same-store trend on Medicare Advantage benefits, i.e., the ones that don't change year-to-year in negative territory. Is that accurate as observation? And if that's still accurate, and can you give us any further elaboration on that?","James E. Murray","Can you go into a little bit more detail on specifically what you're -- I'm not sure I'm understanding...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess what I'm referring to is if you think about the per member cost for the traditional Medicare benefits.","James E. Murray","Are you talking about medical costs or administrative costs?","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Medical costs. No, I'm talking about medical costs.","James E. Murray","Okay, got it.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So secular trend might be, in any given year, in the low double digits, low- to mid-single digits -- sorry, low- to mid-single digits. But I think you've referenced bringing that down into negative territory for next year was my understanding anyway.","James E. Murray","I think when we talked a couple of calls ago, we highlighted that with funding -- this is for 2014, with funding cuts and the industry tax and secular trends, that we were looking at trying to overcome about an 8% or thereabout cost reduction. And what we detailed back then were the trend benders around home care program: the transition program that Jim Bloem referenced and I think Bruce Broussard referenced; the in-home assessments, which are the early identification of folks who could go into some of our clinical programs; contracting, both facility and pharmacy contracting; the growth of risk-sharing contracts and getting some of the providers that we work with to modify their behavior around quality and cost; some of the programs where we did HRAs much more timely and got people identified that might benefit from some of these programs, that was a big part of our trend bender work that we've detailed before. The MRA work that we do every year, like a lot of our competitors, is a big part of how we offset some of that 8% that I talked about. One of the things that goes lost in this discussion, we talked a lot about 2013 bids and the premium and benefit changes that we made for 2013 because of our 2012 problems, well, actually the 2014 premium and benefit changes were very similar to that which we did for 2013. But what we were fortunate enough to have is all of these other things where maybe some of our competitors did not. And so when you put all those pieces together, we feel very good about how we've attacked that 8%, and now, we need to do that again for 2015. But we're into a rhythm there and we feel very good about the process that we've created to do that.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could just follow up on one other topic, which is on the non-recurrence of prior period reserve development, which I'm just looking at your slide deck table here. I think that's $110 million as a bridge negative part of the bridge you have to climb on 2014. And I just wanted to ask about that $110 million because the gross PPRD, and admittedly, this is gross, I think that you've disclosed in the press release is $319 million so far for this year versus $178 million a year ago. So -- and then, there's a higher number, obviously, on the reserve roll forward table. So can you just help us understand getting from that $319 million, and that's a year-over-year change by the way of $141 million, how do you bridge that to the $110 million there?","Steven E. McCulley","Yes, Matt, this is Steve. So the way to think about the PPD and the reserve table is if you look at, say, the last 3, 3 to 4 years of the reserve development as a percent of the total reserves and you would kind of get an average percentage there, that would give you kind of -- because we use the same methodology year in, year out, you would get kind of a normal what you might expect. And then when you do that, you see that this year, as you noted, is more than normal. And it's actually probably a bigger number than $110 million as you pointed out. But in $110 million, because we do have risk-sharing arrangement with providers, we've netted that down to what the true impact was, that we think was greater than normal net of our risk sharing. Does it makes sense?","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, it does.","James E. Murray","And not to pile on, Matt, but we're pleased with the current year PPD because, as you know, when you do a bid for 2014, you start with your 2012 base level. And to the extent you see favorable development during 2013, it makes you feel better about 2014's achievability.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question, I wanted to come back to the Retail segment margin assumption. So based on your guidance, you're at 4.8% pretax for 2013 in Retail segment. As reported, you're projecting 4.6% in '14. I'm calculating the industry tax is worth roughly 80 basis points, so on an adjusted basis, the retail margin in '14 would be about 3.8% or down 100 basis points versus this year. Is that a reasonable way of looking at it?","Steven E. McCulley","I think so. Remember that the $175 million of investments in the duals and the exchanges are also in that number, too.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure, of course, yes. And then second question, just interested on your thoughts on the exchange strategy, particularly, I noticed there's a number of markets where you guys tend to have a very attractive price from a consumer perspective in gold and platinum products. There are several markets where you're the only platinum product that's available. So just interested in thoughts around the strategy and the risk of adverse selection?","Bruce D. Broussard","I think the big thing for us is most of the markets we went in with an effective network. And that has allowed us to be very price-conscious, or attract a price-conscious member. And so when you look at our pricing, you really need to look at the benefits [ph] of the package as part of that. And obviously, when you have an effective network, you're going to have a reduced opportunity for choice. And so we're looking for the members that are probably less oriented to selecting their provider in a broad way. And we think that those members will probably have less utilization in the particular markets that we're in.","James E. Murray","And the other thing that I would add would be that a lot of people who are a lot smarter than me have done fairly sophisticated models and they've studied the impact of risk adjustment and the risk-adjustment process, as it respects the older age levels. And they've gotten themselves pretty comfortable that the slope between the different metallic tiers is pretty reasonable. And so we're actually fairly positive about folks who might come to us in those higher metallic tiers and our pricing reflects that. Some of our competitions seems to have also picked up on that, while others of our competition didn't seem to spot that opportunity. So we've stepped back and we feel really, really good about our pricing in many of the markets that we're in.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a few clarifying questions. So I understand that you're embedding in the $0.50 to $0.90 some expectation for potential exchange losses. Is it possible to size -- as I look at the 3 Rs, I'm really just struggling without a fleet of actuaries to think about kind of what a range of outcomes could look like. What kind of losses in terms of pretax, after-tax margin, however you want to think about it, do we think we can get on the exchange enrollment?","James E. Murray","I'm not sure I'm going to specifically answer your question. I'll give you some thoughts. Steve earlier mentioned that both of the investments are significant for purposes of thinking through how you may split those apart in your own mind. I would tell you that the folks that we have that are very smart have stepped back and said, based upon what's been happening of late, what might this population that we get look like, and they talked about using a COBRA population. And many of you are familiar with COBRA, and people who buy COBRA are likely in need of those kinds of benefits. And so they studied that COBRA population. And they said, were we to get a population off the exchange because of some of what has happened, it looks like for COBRA population, this is what could happen. And that's reflective of some of the investment spend that we've shared with you here today.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. In terms of the levers in Medicare Advantage, it looks like you're going offset the health insurance fee in the recalibration of the risk adjustment model and a lot of other things. Is it possible to think about what you feel really confident, you know you've gotten, versus things that are kind of still out there and squishy. I mean, capitation feels like a known. Were you able to negotiate the health insurance fee in your risk-sharing capitation arrangement or is that still outstanding? Clinical programs, how much help were you counting on in retail MA, and how much do you know is going to come versus not? Is there any way to size kind of what's known, what's not? Like 3\/4 is known, half is known, all is known, how do we think about that?","James E. Murray","You're referencing the trend benders that we're anticipating for 2014?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Exactly. Like the things that you're anticipating in the MA, particularly the retail. I guess, we can just look at the retail margin.","James E. Murray","Sure. All the contractual stuff that I talked about earlier is obviously done and in the can. What we're doing relative to some of these other programs is we've got a team of actuaries. You may have heard us detail on our Friday meetings, our trend bender, our 15% solution meetings. We have a team of actuaries who is constantly studying how we're doing on each and every one of these programs that we've talked with you about in the past. And they continually tell us that the investment that we make in those that we've shared with you in the past is producing the results that we had anticipated. As we grow that membership and enrollment in all of those programs, we have the actuaries go back and restudy that. And so as long as we get to the growth in those programs that we think is necessary to get to the 2014 levels and we're very close, I would tell you that we feel very good based upon a lot of smart actuaries looking in the rearview mirror about the beneficial effect of these programs. And so I sit here today pretty confident that what we talked about for 2014 will come to fruition.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like we're better than 90% there; we're not guessing on a lot.","James E. Murray","90% is your number.","Regina Nethery","This is Regina. We're getting really long on the hour, and we've got several more people in the queue. We want to try and take as many questions as we can. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I hate to belabor this point, but I'm still a little confused on retail MLR. The midpoint implies a modest improvement, but you've got the non-repeat of prior-period development and inclusion of exchange members and maybe MA duals, all of which could add upward pressure. So can you talk about what you're assuming for the retail utilization trends and then bridge that to where the underlying retail medical cost trend for '14 is from a baseline perspective and how that compares to what it would look like post the Humana trend benders?","James H. Bloem","Let me go back to the MLR first. If you think about -- I think, the MLR, because of the industry fee being one of the items that we had to put into the calculus when we did the bids, the MLR needed to improve in order for us to hit the bottom line margin because now we had a large fee to overcome, including the nondeductibility. So we would have expected to have had MLR improvement in that business in order to overcome that headwind, which I think it's apparent in the results, that we did. So as you're doing that math, you're seeing that. And again, just with respect to how we did that, I would go back to the overall trend bender discussion that we've talked about with our clinical programs and clinical assessments and the model and the investments we've made over the past 12 to 18 months to produce that result. So I don't know that we get into specifics about what maybe a secular trend is and what our trend is. We have -- there are so many variables there, we tend not to get into that level of detail. Does that make sense, Sarah?","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes. Can you discuss at all -- I know you've done this for the group but you've talked about where the group cost trend will go from '13 to '14, does that hold true for retail? Are you assuming a 50 to 100 basis point uptick in cost trends from utilization? Is that the same in this segment, so the rest you can think of as being trend benders?","James H. Bloem","No. I don't think it's the same. I think we start -- on the group side and the commercial trend, we look at a number of variables. Our actuaries look at a number of variables that have been underlying utilization for the past couple of years and what those same variables might predict utilization's going to do in the next couple of years. So given everything that's going on with health care reform and the economy, you've got a lot of different things impacting the commercial cost trends and that population versus a different set of items affecting utilization in Medicare. So I think it's a bit different. So we tend to see the utilization of seniors being on a same-store basis relatively constant over a period of time, so we don't seem to see the same peaks and valleys that we might in an under-65 population that might be more impacted by an economy or other things. So we see kind of a -- we tend to think of an underlying trend rate for seniors and then we go in and work on all of our clinical programs and all of our trend benders, and we're constantly studying the impact that our work is having on our population and kind of compare that back to the underlying trend rate as a whole. So I don't think we would say that the base trend rate, if there is such a thing, for the Medicare fee-for-service population is doing anything different going forward than it's done in the past. We see that as fairly constant.","Operator","And your next question is from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had 2 questions, just on the enrollment guidance. The first is just on the individual enrollment guidance that you put out. Just if you can give us some details on what you're thinking in terms of on-exchange enrollment as compared to off-exchange enrollment attrition in individual? And then just second, on the Medicare Advantage enrollment growth that you're guiding for, if you have a view on how that will split up between HMO and PPO?","James E. Murray","This is Jim Murray, you've asked the hardest question to try to figure out, to be as brutally honest as I can be. Given where we're at today, our assumption is that there will be an extension to the open enrollment period. If there is not, then some of the numbers that we put out there would probably be in question. So we expected a 500,000 sale result as a result of the exchanges, initially, because of what happened, we've seen some guidance from a lot of government entities and what-have-you, suggesting that, that might be cut in half. We devaluated that, and that's kind of where we're at, around 200 to 250. Again, it all is an impact of how long the enrollment period stays open. From the other side, from off-exchange, we expect that there will be some deterioration in our existing membership. We've had to send out some letters. Some of those letters were to change the effective date of the plan. Some of the letters, like you've seen in the press, had to do with the cancellation of those particular policies because they weren't ACA compliant. We've taken all of that and we've done, frankly, our best guess at what the enrollment might be. But I will tell you that -- and there's a wide range, but I will tell you that, that's the one projection on this page that I'm most up in the air about.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Then just on the MA split?","James E. Murray","What was your question on that one, Scott? I got so wrapped up in my answer on the first one that I forgot your second question.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure, just the breakdown between how you're thinking about in terms of the adds, the split between HMO and PPO on MA?","James E. Murray","Yes, I don't know that I have it. Do you have that?","Steven E. McCulley","I think it will be mostly HMOs is what we're anticipating.","James E. Murray","I think that's the case, but I don't know the exact...","Steven E. McCulley","Yes, I don't know the exact percentage, but clearly, we believe it will be mostly HMO-weighted.","Operator","And your last question is from the line of Chris Rigg of Susquehanna International Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to a few other questions right at the outset of the Q&A. With regard to the $0.70 of investment, can you help us -- or just maybe clarify for me what's sort of truly onetime in nature that you wouldn't expect to occur again in the future? And then sort of just what's timing differences in Medicaid premiums coming in versus having boots on the grounds on the state? And then just more generally, can you give us a context of what you actually think losses might be initially?","Steven E. McCulley","This is Steve, I'll try to -- I'll start off. Again, I think just the way we think about it, what we said is that the $175 million or the midpoint of that range which is $0.70 is effectively going to be losses in those 2 businesses that result -- first of all, they're both significant. I wouldn't say that one's a lot larger than the other, so -- but the nature of them is different. As Jim described earlier, in the dual-eligible expansion, most of that is infrastructure startup before the revenue. As we're winning contracts, some members will come onboard. They don't all come onboard at the same time. They come onboard ratably throughout the year. And so we have to have our infrastructure in place ahead of the revenue. So -- and there may be a little bit of that investment as well in terms of getting our programs to be as effective, in terms of managing all the variables that we have to manage with the long-term support services and the duals and the chronic -- the members with chronic conditions. So getting all of that in place and up and running, think of that as mostly infrastructure that's temporary. And once the revenue gets up to the run rate, then there will be revenue to cover that cost. And then we'll start to approach the target margins that we plan to get to ultimately. On the exchange side, it's much more of a wildcard around how much membership we get and the risk of that membership that we get. And if you look at our range, our membership range was anywhere from negative 100,000 to positive 100,000, and the risk mix of that could be variable. So they're different. They're not that different in terms of the magnitude in size, but they're very different in their characteristics, if that helps.","Bruce D. Broussard","Well, like always, we appreciate everyone's support for the organization and especially our associates, our 50,000 associates. We make this look easy as we talk about it, but they are hard at work helping our members and, obviously, helping grow Humana. So we thank all our associates. With that, I hope everyone has a great day, and we'll conclude.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Humana's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Regina Nethery. You may begin your conference.","Regina Nethery","Thank you, and good morning. In a moment, Humana's senior management team will discuss our first quarter results and our of dated earnings outlook for 2015. Participating in today's prepared remarks will be Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Kane, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session will be Jim Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.","We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both managements' prepare my remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. This call is also being simulcast via the Internet along with the virtual slide presentation. An Adobe version of today's slide deck has been posted to the Investor Relations section of Humana's website.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statements. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in this morning's earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases, and our filings with the SEC are all available on Humana's investor relations website.","Call participants should also note that today's discussion and slide presentation include financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures is included in today's slide presentation as well as a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this morning's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Humana and announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up 5% from the first quarter of last year. Our pre-tax earnings of $744 million were a record high, and we believe are a clear demonstration on the progress we continue to make as a company. Further, we continue to have confidence in our full year guidance for adjusted earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share. Our more significant achievements during the quarter included substantial membership growth in our Medicare Advantage standalone PDT and HumanaOne one products, the recent launch of our population health technology business, Transcend Insights, announcement of the pending sale of our Concentra business, and completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program.","I'll begin with our Medicare Advantage growth. As we shared with you last quarter, we experienced another successful Medicare enrollment season for 2015. Individual Medicare Advantage membership at March 31, 2015 was up 11% versus the end of the fourth quarter 2014, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see the positive impact for our members of stability in our value proposition as well as high star quality ratings. A recent Mackenzie study on the 2015 star ratings concludes that HMO plans perform best on an enrollment weighted basis. Approximately 56% of our individual members are in HMO plans compared to 53% a year ago. Further, the Mackenzie study indicates that plans built around integrated delivery networks achieve higher average star ratings. CMS recently eliminated certain fixed thresholds for four-star ratings for 2017 bonus year. These changes may result in some pressure on our overall star ratings, but we believe we will sustain our solid competitive advantage. We expect we will maintain our high quality ratings due to our successful integrated care delivery model. Our model includes use of data analytics to engage members and preventative measures and wellness programs that close clinical gaps and care.","In some, we believe the combination of a solid value proposition and a high quality ratings are critical to attracting new membership and retaining our existing membership base. Our projected 2015 net new membership gains of approximately 12% including a voluntary retention rate of approximately 90% are all helping to validate this belief.","CMS has also recently released its final Medicare rates for 2016. While we were encouraged by the average rate increase for the first time in seven years, this average still lags fee for service medical cost trends. Additionally, CMS's transition to the new risk adjustment model will negatively impact certain of our markets that are leading the country in value-based reimbursement methods and holistically assisting members with multiple complex chronic conditions, both of which are key goals for CMS. As we prepare our Medicare bids for 2016, we will seek to minimize any disruption that rate changes may cause to Medicare beneficiaries while holding firm on our 4.5% to 5% pre-tax margin target.","The continuing investment in our clinical model are expected to provide some offsets to rate pressures. That will vary, of course, from market-to-market. Those investments were highlighted this month by Humana At Home's acquisition of Your Home Advantage, a leading provider of nurse practitioner in home visits. Additionally, we believe our focus on the consumer experience and our proprietary market point distribution channel will be important elements in solidifying our relationship with our members as we face these rate challenges at the market level.","Turning to our standalone PDP offerings. We also experienced significant growth for these products with membership up 10% since the end of 2014 and 14% to the first quarter of last year, primarily in our low price point offerings.","I now will spend some time on our investments in healthcare exchanges and state-based contracts. We're pleased that HumanaOne membership has continued to grow nicely. While we continue to project at least breakeven results for our HumanaOne business, our projected increased reliance on the 3Rs is driven primarily by the results for the State of Georgia and our out-of-network provider usage. We believe both are isolated and addressable. Brian will discuss each of these factors in his remarks.","Entering a new customer segment is never an easy task. However, we believe that healthcare exchanges are a leading example of the ongoing movement to the retail model where we have been so effective in Medicare. We continue to be highly targeted in terms of where we will participate in healthcare exchanges, with a strong emphasis on current Medicare Advantage markets to enable customer migration as members' life situations change. Our expansions in the healthcare exchanges and our state-based contracts are deepening our partnership with local providers, local market providers as we develop local market scale through multiple product offerings.","State-based Medicaid membership was now includes those members associated with dual demonstration programs is up significantly, both on a sequential basis and year over year. We continue to monitor the RFP pipeline and plan to pursue other state-based opportunities later in 2015. These opportunities would not be as viable if it weren't for our integrated care delivery model. Importantly, we continue to show progress in key integrated care delivery model metrics. Some examples include the number of individual Medicare Advantage members covered by value-based arrangements is now more than 54%. This is particularly encouraging given the substantial increase in membership this quarter. Membership in our Humana chronic care program is up 10% since the end of the year and 56% versus the prior year.","Adoption of mail-order pharmacy among our members continues to grow as we highlight this benefit more fully during the sales process and welcome calls. Individual Medicare Advantage mail-order penetration is now on an average approaching 35%. We continue to focus on reaching out to members with gaps in care and have sent over 4 million proactive messages to 2.5 million members to prevent gaps in care. These actions have resulted in a gap closure rate of more than 30%. As the leader in both the development and execution of value-based payment models and technology driven population health management analytics, we support trends that encourage care coordination across all payers.","In that context, this quarter, we launched Transcend Insights, which leverages the population health capabilities we have developed in our Medicare Advantage business. Our goal is to provide payer agnostic tools to provider partners allowing more of our members to be in value-based reimbursement models. As we've shared with you in the past, value-based arrangements have proven to lead to higher HEDIS scores, lower medical costs, and higher members' CHIP satisfactions.","Before closing, I'd like to spend a moment on our recently announced sale of Concentra. As we have said in previous calls, we review our various businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure each earns its cost of capital and is aligned with our integrated care delivery strategy. The Concentra acquisition was part of a multi-pronged approach to increase our capabilities of managing risk through primary care physicians. Our subsequent MSO acquisitions and joint venture investments provided a more integrated primary care platform than Concentra.","Although it did not ultimately fit strategically, we were able to achieve an attractive price that will result in a gain versus our initial investment. Brian will speak more to the details of this transaction in his remarks. We expect the transaction will close in the next few weeks. I want to thank all of our Concentra associates for their dedication to the consumer and to our company. Several of you have asked for an update on our PBM evaluation. That work continues, and we expect to provide a full debriefing on our analysis during the third quarter earnings call in November.","In summary, we believe our robust organic membership and revenue growth together with our proven superior clinical operating performance and disciplined capital allocation all come together to provide our sustainable competitive advantage. Excluding the onetime gains that we expect from the Concentra sale, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 and look forward to providing you updates as the year progresses.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials.","Brian Kane","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model. The attractiveness of our product offerings is resonating with our customers as demonstrated by the continuing increases in our Medicare Advantage, standalone PDP and exchange membership. Consequently, we have raised full year membership expectations for both standalone PDP and HumanaOne. Standalone PDP is being driven by higher retention that we are seeing post the open enrollment period, which is largely the results of fewer auto enrollees being reassigned. I'll speak more to the HumanaOne business shortly.","With regard to our Medicare Advantage growth, early indications for our new members are positive as we evaluate individual market growth and performance. Additionally, the growth in our PBM and Humana At Home businesses remains unabated with not only more volume driven by membership growth but also deeper penetration in terms of increased engagement as well as benefits from scale that are driving results. First quarter revenues for the healthcare services segment rose 26% versus the prior year and pre-tax earnings are up 24% year over year.","The quarter had several developments that will be the focus of my remarks today. These include the following: the increase in our projected 3R receivables for the year, medical utilization and prior-period development, days and claims payable and cash flows from operations, the earnings implications of the Concentra transaction, and capital allocation.","Let's begin with our exchange business in the premium stabilization programs commonly called the 3Rs. Our conviction in our healthcare exchange strategy remains strong. We continue to focus on our key growth markets by offering high-value networks to drive affordability and access for our customers. We believe that this strategy has been effective in successfully establishing a new growth business while providing a compelling product that our members value. Over time, we believe that HumanaOne will not only contribute meaningfully to our results but it will also, as Bruce emphasized, advance our objectives of local market presence and scale with providers while allowing us to offer a range of products that are relevant to our customers no matter their age or income circumstance.","As with any start-up business, we've had our successes as well as our challenges. In terms of successes, our ACA compliant membership for HumanaOne is up 38% from the end of 2014, well ahead of our previous expectations. This was driven by better than forecast sales and lower than anticipated attrition. Consequently, we have adjusted our aggregate HumanaOne guidance to reflect higher projected membership in the ACA compliant business which we also believe results in us approaching the scale we need for long-term success. We continue to forecast that we will have at least breakeven results in 2015 and earn a reasonable return on capital in 2016, albeit that achievement of breaking results this year now includes higher reliance on the 3Rs than previously anticipated coming into 2015.","As you've seen from our release, we've increased our net 2015 3R guidance range to $450 million to $550 million with reinsurance accounting for approximately 75% and risk adjustment and risk corridors accounting for approximately 25% of the total. As we have discussed in the past, there is an interplay between risk adjustment and risk corridors in that if we don't get the risk adjustment exactly right, the meaningful part of the balance, either positive or negative, is captured through the risk corridors.","As we evaluate our financial performance to date, including runoff claims from 2014, the drivers of the increase in full year receivables related to the 3Rs are quantifiable and addressable. The first two Bruce mentioned in his remarks are higher than anticipated out-of-network utilization and poor results in our Georgia market. The last driver of the higher receivables is simply a function of having more members than we had previously expected.","I'll start with out-of-network utilization. As the exchanges were rolling out across the nation, we believed there would be a time period during which our members will be getting accustomed to our efficient network products. Consequently, we permitted out of network utilization for the small proportion of our members who did not stay in network to avoid disruption notwithstanding the products design, which underpinned the affordability that our members seek. Our provider network team has thoroughly evaluated our networks in light of our membership levels by markets, and we are very satisfied in our level of network adequacy. As a consequence, we are in the process of implementing stricter enforcement of network utilization by working closely with non-network providers as well as educating our members on the product. Higher levels of in-network utilization are anticipated to ensure the continued affordability of our healthcare exchange offerings as well as align with our pricing assumptions for the remainder of the year and for 2016.","After adjusting for the out-of-network usage, our markets across the country, including our largest HumanaOne market in Florida, are performing within expectations, with the notable exception of Georgia. One of the challenges we faced in both 2013 and 2014 was the immaturity of the claims data we had available at the time we set our healthcare exchange pricing for the following year versus what we would've preferred, specifically, more detail regarding statewide market conditions and health status based on significant exchange claims data. To help address this, we juxtaposed the limited Georgia claims data we had against claims data nationally for states that we believe had similar utilization patterns and mix of likely enrollees to derive assumptions from the population health of each state and, in turn, set our pricing.","Recent actuarial claims data for the state of Georgia now indicate that enrollees in the state as a whole are skewing more towards being a less healthy state population than we had believed and had priced four. Consequently, we are accruing both a risk adjustment and risk corridor receivable. It's important to recall that this was the original intent behind the premium stabilization programs, namely early year protection in this circumstance. We are, of course, incorporating our emerging experience into our actuarial assumptions and are taking the appropriate targeted actions through pricing and product design when we file our 2016 rates in the next few weeks to ensure that George's results will be back on track for 2016 without reliance on the risk corridors.","As I mentioned, the remaining driver of the higher 3R balance relates to higher than projected growth of our ACA compliant business. This will result in higher 2015 receivables than we had expected, primarily associated with reinsurance. Finally, a quick word on our 2014 3R accruals. As you will see, we have decreased reinsurance by approximately $50 million and have increased our risk corridors by around $40 million as an offset. As we have evaluated the run out of a 2014 claims, fewer of our members anticipated will hit the reinsurance attachment point, which is the reason we have made this change.","Turning to medical utilization. We're watching very closely the hospital inpatient admissions per thousand data for our Medicare Advantage business. We have seen some of the hospital published data which suggests higher Medicare usage of inpatient services and have also witnessed in the last number of weeks an uptick in inpatient authorizations. For Medicare Advantage, we have projected a decline year-over-year in-hospital missions, and for the first quarter, we have seen that decline bear out. In other words, our trend vendors continue to result in lower admissions. However, during the last weeks of the quarter and into April, we are seeing an elevated level of authorizations for hospital admissions, which, although still declining, are slightly higher than we had anticipated.","Importantly, we have also seen data throughout the quarter that would suggest our cost per admit is lower than forecast, implying lower severity conditions are driving the admissions. While it's too early to draw any conclusions from what I just described, especially as admissions tend to fluctuate, it is something that bears close watching as the actual claims experience develops over the coming months. As was highlighted in this morning's press release, we did see a lower level of favorable prior-period development than in last year's first quarter. A meaningful portion of the lower prior-period development was unanticipated due to the PPD for the first quarter of 2014 having been unusually high. And as a result of claims processing changes involving the implementation in early 2014 of a front end review for Medicare claims. Front end review enables us to improve the initial accuracy of claim payments, reducing the amount of overpayments recaptured later as part of prior-period development. PPD was also adversely impacted by fourth quarter flu claims that came through in the first of 2015 across our lines of business.","I will now turn to the balance sheet and operating cash flow. I'll start with days and claims payable, or DCP. You will note that we have revised the DCP table to exclude reinsurance associated with the 3Rs. Given that reinsurance reduces benefits expense but does not impact the related benefits payable, it skews DCP trends over the three-year period of the program.","Days and claims payable during the first quarter of 2015 declined by less than a day, driven primarily by the typical first quarter increase in Part D claims associated with our Medicare Advantage business. That impact is included in the all other category of the DCP roll forward table in our press release. Recall that our standalone PDP business is excluded from our days and claims payable calculation. Much like our standalone PDP offerings, our Medicare Advantage Part D benefit designs generally have the plan picking up substantially all the initial pharmacy claims but covering less of the benefit as the year progresses. While the pharmacy expense associated with these members is in our DCP calculation, the related but payable is relatively small due to the speed of processing pharmacy claims.","Higher capitation and provider settlements also resulted in a slight decrease to DCP during the quarter, but importantly, this was more than offset by an increase in unprocessed and processed claims inventories. Cash flow from operations is down versus the first quarter 2014 as higher net income was more than offset by working capital items. Specifically, the increase in benefits payable, which accompanies growing very membership, was smaller year-over-year due to the lower level of overall growth in average membership given the outsized growth we experienced in 2014. This pressured the cash flow from operations on a comparative basis by approximately $250 million in the quarter.","Working capital needs for our growing pharmacy business primarily accounted for the remainder of the delta in the first quarter cash flow. For the year, our operating cash flow guidance is largely unchanged. Other than reducing operating cash flow by guidance, our cash flow guidance by proximally $200 million at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the increase in the 3R receivable that I just discussed previously as well as the pending sale of Concentra.","Before closing, I'll spend just a few moments on capital allocation and earnings guidance. As Bruce said in his remarks, we announced this quarter the sale of our Concentra business. The timing of the signing of the definitive agreement triggered the need to recognize the gain on the establishment of a deferred tax asset, and thus the $0.35 per share gain was included in our first quarter GAAP results. We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks, so we have included the full impact of the transaction in our earnings guidance, both from a GAAP and an adjusted perspective. For GAAP, we are including a total projected gain from the sale in the range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share including the $0.35 tax gain.","On an adjusted basis, excluding this onetime gain, we continue to forecast earnings per share in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. The sale of Concentra is expected to generate net of taxes and deal expenses approximately $1 billion in net proceeds. Before any anticipated use of these proceeds, the sale will result in $0.11 of 2015 EPS dilution. We continue to look for value enhancing acquisitions such as the Your Home Advantage deal we recently announced that will advance our in-home capabilities as well as pursue additional share repurchase opportunistically. However, given where we are in the year, it is likely that a good portion of this dilution will persist. With respect to share repurchase, this quarter, we completed our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Additionally, holding true on our commitment to buy back $1 billion of stock by June of this year, we have entered into a 10b51 plan that we expect will complete that goal. You will note however that we have raised our guidance slightly for the average fully diluted share count, due largely to the higher than anticipated buyback price which will have a several cent negative EPS impact.","Finally, our workaround optimizing our portfolio continues to ensure that each of our businesses fits strategically and earns its cost of capital. More generally, we are encouraged by our progress and our prospects, all driven by execution around our integrated care delivery strategy.","With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. And fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the utilization transit you guys are monitoring. I just want to understand what exactly is driving that? I think you mentioned in public data from some of the hospitals, but I have to assume you're going off of more internal data. So is there any specific lines of service or are there specific type of lives, any geographies or any new members? Do you have any color on where this utilization is coming from?","Brian Kane","Good morning, Josh. It's certainly from our own data that we're seeing a slight uptick in admissions over the last few weeks and into April. There's no specific geography that we would point to. It's something that we continue to evaluate. I would note that interestingly, not only are the unit cost of these admits lower, which as I said in my remarks suggesting lower severity of claims, but also our outpatient utilization seems to be down and our pharmacy utilization is in line. And so it's very early really to ascertain exactly what this is telling us. It's just something that we thought it would be important to communicate because it's something that we're watching very closely, and it's something that we always watch very closely.","James Murray","Josh, just to build on what Brian talked about and the reason that he specifically addressed it in his opening remarks is as we saw this, we began to dive into a lot of the information relative to new members and what we call concurrent members. And actually the new members that we just, that just join the plans, which were fairly significant, we're seeing actually better utilization than the concurrent members. So that gives us comfort that there wasn't an issue with any of the markets that we grew in. A lot of the deep dives that we're doing, and there's a lot of work that we're trying to pull together, would suggest that there are some respiratory issues that we're facing.","So that leads us somewhat to a conclusion that it's maybe a longer extension of the flu, but a lot of work needs to be done to get our arms around it, but we feel very confident about how it's progressing, and we feel good about a lot of the things that we do from a process perspective. This looks like an isolated incident.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. That's helpful, Jim. And I guess just maybe help us understand the magnitude here. If you take a look at this uptick in outpatient utilization within lower outpatient RX in line and maybe it's just flu. I mean if this were to persist through April, May, June, is this enough to change guidance? Or is this just something that the pressure point and the reason we're still comfortable in a relatively wide range of EPS [ph]?","Brian Kane","Josh, I would say if this persists as we see it, it's not something that would impact guidance, but it's something that we watch very closely, obviously, to the extent there was a continued uptick and a greater uptick. That's something that would have an impact, but we're not seeing that right now.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. Thanks.","Brian Kane","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from David Windley from Jefferies.","David Windley","Hi. Thanks. I'm going to shift over to the HumanaOne. I wanted to understand if your change in or lack of change in age distribution in that book of business in the slide that you presented to us last quarter, yet fairly significant change in medals for your distribution, if essentially that adverse selection had anything to do with your additional reliance on 3Rs?","Bruce Broussard","It's something we continue to evaluate. We certainly evaluate all of our medal tiers and try to understand where the utilization is coming from, particularly in Georgia where we've seen that. I think it's fair to say that we're going to continue to evaluate as we go into 2016 our participation in the various middle tiers. And certainly our pricing will reflect the increased morbidity we are seeing in that block. I would also say that the out-of-network utilization is something that we think we can address in short order, and so that will not be a recurring issue going forward.","David Windley","And on the out-of-network, just to follow up on that, is that something where you are essentially only lightly enforcing the existing policy or rule and now you're going to more stringently enforce? Or do you actually have to change the policy, and is that possible entry year?","Bruce Broussard","I would say the former. It's something that we lightly enforce as we're coming into this program with new product, with new customers; it was something that they were going to get accustomed to the product design. Over the next few months, it's something that we will enforce the policy that exists, and that really, as I said my remarks, goes both to working with providers to the out-of-network providers and some of the reimbursement levels that we pay them as well as educating our customers as to the product that they bought. We believe strongly that the strategy that we've pursued is one that allows our customers to have a very affordable and compelling product, and as we educate them, we think we will be able to get that out-of-network utilization under control.","David Windley","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice","Hello, everybody. I'm going to go back to the comments that Bruce had made about there being some pressure for threshold eliminations on the STARS program. Can you give us a little more color on how significant that would be and are we talking about something that would impact your potentially in 2017? Is that the right way to think about it? Or is there any reason it would impact earlier?","James Murray","This is Jim Murray. It would be 2017, and as many of you know, we're in the process today and for the next several weeks of finalizing a lot of the work related to the benefit year 2017. The threshold elimination puts a little bit of pressure and what that would translate into is the number of members that are in four-star or greater plans. A lot of the feedback that we are getting; we have a team of people that comes before us every Friday to talk about the progress that we are making around a lot of the tactical steps that are part of this whole process that goes over this two-month period.","We feel very good about where we are positioned. Some pressure related to the elimination by CMS of the threshold, but frankly, feel pretty good about how things are playing out this year, and we should be favorable positioned relative to the competition, because we like a lot of the good work we do around the STARS program.","Bruce Broussard","And, A.J, I think it's important to keep in mind that it is a relative measurement, and so our performance is highly predicated on everyone else's performance. And I think as investors have seen over the past few years, our clinical capabilities have really outperformed the industry as a whole, and we continue to be confident that we will be able to continue to outperform even as these changes persist.","A.J. Rice","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker","Thanks. Good morning. I was just hoping to follow up on your comments around some may be some of the moving parts in guidance. It sounds like the concentric deal as you guys pointed out in the press release originally is about 11% headwind to earnings this year. You also called out around the pressure around the impact from share repurchases related to the stock appreciation here, and now looking at guidance, it seems like the tax rate may have come down a little bit, but I'm just curious what some of the other moving parts were that let you feel confident to maintain your guidance range maybe versus where it was last quarter? Thanks.","Brian Kane","I think you outlined some of the major issues that we are focused. Concentra will pressure earnings by $0.11. With the share repurchases tax rates and the like it's probably about $0.04, so it's a $0.15 headwind coming into this quarterly call. Again, we feel comfortable about reiterating our guidance of $8.50 to $9.00. And really was going to drive that performance, as we said to the first question is where is utilization ultimately end up? And right now, we feel good about where we are, but that's something we're very focused on that will ultimately drive the year's numbers.","I think the important point on the Concentra sale is it is a timing issue for us versus a long-term business problem. As we think about the sale, we think about it as that we are really allowing the company to redeploy assets that will advance us strategically at a price that we feel was a very good value for what we are doing, and now what we can do is take that and redeploy it, whether it's in capital structure alterations such as stock buybacks or acquisitions that will be more accretive long-term and strategically much stronger.","Andrew Schenker","Thanks. Maybe if I could just squeeze one more in real quick. The Healthcare Services segment specifically, I hear a lot of moving parts related to Concentra as well as your Home Health [ph] acquisition. If you could just maybe talk about how those kind of offset each other as well as maybe membership growth that allowed you to kind of maintain revenue guidance. And it seems like the only impact pre-tax results was related to the pre-tax gains. So just making sure I understand moving parts there as well. Thank you.","Bruce Broussard","Sure. Well as you'll see in the Healthcare Services segment guidance, we did adjust the revenue numbers and the like to comport with a divestiture of Concentra. I would say more broadly that as I said in my remarks, that business is performing extremely well. Membership is growing pretty dramatically based on largely our Medicare Advantage and PDP growth, but we're also seeing better engagement with our members both from a mail-order perspective on the pharmacy, which is very important, but also with Humana At Home as our analytical capabilities continue to identify people who would benefit from our Humana At Home capabilities. And so the combination of those is really driving that performance. So we feel very good about the range we have out there for Healthcare Services pre-tax.","Andrew Schenker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. If I could just ask a question about the individual market, just with two parts. Number one, the extent to which you are seeing in flow of new members coming into the exchanges generally for this year. A peer company of yours earlier today talked about seeing less in flow than they had expected. Secondly, just on Georgia, how you reprice in that market and avoid getting stuck in sort of an adverse collections spiral?","Brian Kane","I think as far as new members, I think really is consistent with what we expected in terms of coming into the market and actually feel reasonably good about the overall pool for what we received. With Georgia, there is no doubt, Matt, that there is something we are very focused on as you put in higher price increases or you're going to attract the wrong members. Part of that is going to go to product design in the middle tiers that we participate in. So we're very cognizant of that risk, and we're going to price appropriately.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa","Getting back to the individual business again, why do you think you had the problems in Georgia? One of your competitors reported earnings earlier that has a number of low-priced silver plans in Georgia. It didn't seem to share the problem that you guys are having there. Do you think it's a local market related to you? Is it some cost disadvantage that you have in Georgia? And how do we avoid this from happening in another state down the road when the risk corridors and risk reinsurance goes away?","James Murray","Peter, this is Jim. I will take your question, and we wondered how long before you would dial-in. With respect to Georgia, as Brian said earlier, one of the things that we did at the very beginning was to take our individual legacy business and do relativities to our small group block of business, because that was a guarantee issue population. We thought that was fairly close to what might ultimately happen on the exchanges. And after that, and that was done local market by local market, we evaluated morbidities across a national basis with the help of an outside consulting actuarial firm. And as a result of that overall evaluation from a national perspective, we lowered some of our markets and expected morbidities.","And with respects to Georgia, while other markets turned out just fine relative to that pricing philosophy, Georgia didn't. Another part of the Georgia issue has to do with the platinum plans, which you have asked about in the past. One of the things that we're seeing with the platinum plans is that the philosophy or the strategy that we've enumerated in the past with you and others is that you need to have documentable risk conditions for the members that are heavier utilizers, and as we study the Georgia population, as we're doing some of our risk adjustment work, we're seeing that the Georgia population, although heavier utilizers, don't have documentable risk conditions, which doesn't allow us then to get risk adjustment for them. And as a result of that, as Brian said, not only in Georgia but also in other states, we're evaluating that requirement as it respects our platinum plan strategies going forward, and you'll see us take some actions relative to that.","Peter Costa","That's helpful. And what is your strategy for avoiding this going forward in other states?","James Murray","Well now we have a lot more actual claims information on which to set pricing, and so as we've done with all of our other products over the years, we're using actual claims to set our pricing, and so our pricing will be consistent with our desire that this block of business will produce a satisfactory return. A lot of what we've done up to this point has been models and estimates based upon other lines of business. Now that we've gotten some real claims information relative to not only 2014 but 2015, that's how we will set our pricing going forward, and we feel very confident on our ability to properly set the right rates.","Peter Costa","Will you offer platinum plans next year?","James Murray","We're going to evaluate that market-by-market and to the extent that it doesn't make sense because of what I talked about relative to documentable risk conditions. We'll evaluate that, and we'll act accordingly.","Peter Costa","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the commentary in the Medicaid side of the business. The company seems to be more aggressively pursuing RFPs, I guess, that you have in the past. Can you talk a little bit about your view kind of what's changed in the last couple of years? And you pursued RFPs in a couple of different ways outright or through joint ventures and things like that. So how do you think about the form that these types of participation might take?","James Murray","I don't think our posture has changed relative to what we look at going forward. I think we continue to believe a partnership model in Medicaid makes sense in most states, if not all states, and we'll continue to do that. We do look at states where we have existing membership, and as their RFPs come out, we want to participate in those RFPs, and that really has been the standard direction and strategy for us. And our existing Medicaid results continue to meet expectations and continues to grow quite nicely, and so as we look at going forward, we continue to believe that the Medicaid platform is a platform that has partnership, a partnership model in states that we are operating at within today.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James","Thank you. I'd like to go back to the out of network utilization portion of the 3R boost. It sounded like this was mainly something that pertained to new members transitioning onto an exchange product, and there has been some stricter network enforcement going on lately, and I guess going forward. Should I think about this as really stepping into the 3Rs for just the first quarter and it adjusts going forward? Or is this something that's going to continue on through the year? And how can you modify your benefit designs in 2016 in a way that would improve this scenario?","James Murray","Well I would say it's going to impact the 3Rs for this year just given where we are with our performance and the like. When people go out-of-network, those are higher costs than we had anticipated and that drives the receivables. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are working with these out-of-network providers both in terms of the reimbursable fees that we pay them in the fee schedules, contracting with them and the like, and it's also a matter of educating our members as to their product, the product that they have. I would say we believe very deeply in the strategy of having these high-value networks that allows us to drive very affordable and attractive pricing to our members. And so those are really the puts and takes. It's a combination of provider and member education. So...","Sarah James","It's more education and less of financial incentives?","James Murray","Well I would say with the providers, there will be financial impacts and financial incentives to ensure that we pay the appropriate levels of reimbursement for what we call our non-par or nonparticipating providers. I should note it's a small number of members that are utilizing the benefit out of network. To some extent, there might be some product design in terms of higher out-of-pocket costs for members who tend to go out of network, and that's something that we would be evaluating for next year. But I think the combination of provider education, provider contracting, as well as member education and some tweaks in the product design, it's a problem that we think we can get our head around and saw for next year and frankly, the back half of this year as well.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Just wanted to stick on the individual business, and I know you're talking about Georgia specifically, but just interested and how much you think you're going to need to be raising premiums on the exchange business more broadly. If we look at your 3Rs accruals now for this year, they're right around a half billion for 2015, and I would calculate that on your sort of ACA compliant individual business, that equates to around 13% of revenue, so given that bowl of three insurance and risk corridors really sort of scale away over the next year or two, just help us think about how much sort of excess premium increases you're going to need to be implementing in order to reflect the expiration of those 2Rs of the 3Rs.","Brian Kane","That's not a specific number for obviously competitive reasons. We wouldn't want to comment on it right now. I would say that certainly we have the 3Rs squarely in mind as we price for next year, we recognize there's one more year to go here with two of the 3Rs. And so we're going to price such that as I said in my remarks we can earn an attractive return on capital in 2016 and beyond. So we understand the dynamics of the market and the 3Rs and the pricing required to do that, and we'll take the necessary steps to make sure we get the right financial return.","James Murray","To Brian's earlier point, many of the markets are performing well, we've got some problems in the state of Georgia that we plan to address with our pricing and product design.","Scott Fidel","Okay. And then just quickly, just on the Medicare, hospital admissions, how geographically broad-based are you seeing that? I mean, I'm just trying to tie that into the comments from CMS on their final 2016 rates call where they said that their actuaries have also seen some flattening out of the admissions trends and I would assume if CMS was highlighting that then was probably more of a broader base. So just interested geographically on how much you're seeing that.","Brian Kane","Yeah, I think is Jim said earlier, we wouldn't call any specific geographies. Where we were very focused was to see where we grew in particular markets and whether that more outsized growth was the cause of the slightly higher admits, and we haven't seen that, they're actually running pretty favorably. So I would suggest it's a broad-based phenomenon that we're watching very closely.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Switching a little bit, you guys have reclassified segments, and I guess within the group book you've seen enrollment declines, I guess the question is how committed are you to this business I guess going forward? Is there any strategic review being contemplated for this segment? And I guess separately, just on the PBM, just want to clarify, you talked about sort of a full debrief on the 3Q call in November. Just hoping to get a little more clarity on that. Is that just a final decision you expect at that point on whether you keep it or come up with some sort of outsourcing arrangement or the like? Thanks.","Brian Kane","To your question on enrollment declines, we made the strategic decision a year or so ago, and I think we talked about that that with the large group business, we're going to wind that down over the next several years, because we are not a national player, and we can't compete in that space. But we are focused on what we call our sweet spot of smaller case sizes. And over the last six months, we performed reasonably well with our sweet spot focus. You may recall that in the fourth quarter, we grew very nicely with our smaller, focused business. This past quarter, we have seen some shrinkage in our fully insured smaller case of membership, as a lot of our competitors are implementing their new rates relative to community rating, and we are seeing a little bit of an aggressive posture in some of the states that we do business. That will ultimately change over time, and we think that that will work itself out. We feel very confident with our focus on the smaller case size.","Over the next several years, we're going to be evaluating our Group business and again feel very good about its prospects for continued profitability, and it serves very nicely as a complement to our focus on local market scale. We talk about that with our Medicare business, our individual business car Medicaid business and our Group business, in certain of what we refer to as bold move markets. So again, we feel very confident with our ability to compete and win with a smaller case size. Hopefully you will see that play out over the next several quarters.","I think even as the results show this quarter, we really have a three-pronged approach within Group. One is around continuing to increase our efficiency within the Group sector, and you can see that as you see our cost ratios coming down. The second is to focus on where we probably have a better value proposition, and that's in the Small Group is what Jim talked about, our sweet spot, and begin to start exiting relationships that are not profitable for us and that traditionally is the larger ASO model. And then the third is to continue to migrate customers to more of a consumer choice model within the markets that we are at, and that would be both a private exchange and public exchanges as we see that being both a long-term trend, and frankly, I think where we can even add more value with our retail capabilities that we've had in the past.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, that's helpful. And just on the PBM?","Brian Kane","As we said, the PBM, we're going to evaluate, and it's under continued evaluation. We've provided some updates in the past, but the full update will be in the third quarter of this year.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from on Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte","Thanks, good morning. So I just want to make sure I understand this. I am a little confused with everything. I'm getting a lot of questions from investors who are pretty confused as well. On retail MLR, what exactly; is this the underlying and Medicare MLR, okay, ex-PYD, and this sort of late quarter potential uptick you are seeing, and is the deterioration, which is not great, but it is deteriorating; because your HumanaOne individual public exchange product is now going to be much more reliant on reinsurance and you're having all these issues?","James Murray","Yes. Again, Ana, if you look at our retail MER's for the quarter, and you adjust them for prior periods, they're actually down from prior quarters. So I think that's important to note. As we said, in the prior period we did have a pretty materially impact on our numbers. A lot of it was expected; some of it wasn't car related to the flu and the like. But, when you look at the MER's, we feel pretty good about where we are on an incurred basis from an MER perspective. As I said, they are actually down. So I hope that answers your question.","Ana Gupte","Okay so MA has been displaced. On Individual, did you see any improvement on your off-exchange ACA compliant type MLR at all? Your competitors seem to be seeing what they said they would see. And so net-net on Individual, you had said you would see margin expansion ex-exchange, public exchanges. What's going on in the rest of the book?","James Murray","Okay, again we don't break our ACA compliant off-exchange and on-exchange. I think when you adjust for the 3Rs, our MER is in line with our expectations, which is why, as I said in my remarks, that we are going to break even or better for 2015. That still is the case. I'm sorry?","Ana Gupte","No, sorry. Please go ahead.","James Murray","I was going to say that the 3Rs truly help us in that regard, and it's higher than we anticipated for the reasons that we went through.","Ana Gupte","Okay, one final one if I may. So then on HumanaOne, why you be in a place where you had some adverse selection last year, and as you're raising prices, are you seeing more of the deterioration in that book, because anyone who can afford or is relatively healthy might migrate someplace else and so you might have challenges just turning around the book?","Brian Kane","As respect to the state of Georgia, which we've talked about a couple of times, I wouldn't have said that it was adverse selection as opposed to the health condition of the entire population. We just have to price reflective of the health condition, and that may cause some of those members to move on to other plans, but we've got to get our pricing commensurate with the risk conditions that we're assuming, and we think that we've got a pretty good plan in place not only to increase pricing but also evaluate some of the products that are in the marketplace.","Ana Gupte","Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","And your final question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold","Hey there. Thanks for taking the question. I'm trying to sort through what belongs in this year versus last year. Was there any net prior-period negative development in the first quarter of this year related to last year in any products?","Brian Kane","I'm not sure I understand the question. There was \u2013 the prior-period development was positive this quarter based on 2014 in prior results. It was less positive than it was last first quarter in 2014. That was largely expected for the reasons I discussed, i.e., it was a very high PPD quarter in the first quarter of 2014, and we implemented some claims processing changes with front end review in Medicare that drove some of the change. Some of that was unexpected. So there is positive PPD in our numbers just less than there was last year.","Christine Arnold","Okay. And then payables versus premiums, I agree we should exclude PDP but if we exclude PDP premiums, your payables versus premiums are still upside down in the first quarter. Now this could be because you've got more capitated costs. It could be because of other factors. Can you help me understand why if you're seeing an increase in utilization, I would think you'd be booking more payables so than premiums. It put these issues with the individual, but it looks like that's not happening. So can you help me sort through what other factors might be accounting for that?","Brian Kane","That comparison, change of premium versus change in claims payables, as we've discussed in the past is not something that we focus on. There are a lot of moving pieces that go into that number. As we have said, with regard to utilization, I wouldn't have made the statement as boldly as you just made it with regard to overall utilization. What we pointed out, because it's important that we pointed out to be fully transparent is that we have seen that slight increase in admits over the recent weeks, and it's something that we're waiting to see how it plays through our claims lags over the coming months.","As you know, it takes a few months for those to work through, but I wouldn't have made the overall statement that utilization is up. Remember that our admits are actually down year over year. Our trend benders are working as we've said and so I wouldn't read into it anything more than that. As you look for balance sheet quality and cash flow quality, the claims, the processed claims and unprocessed claims on a DCP basis are actually up, which I know is a measure that you and others look at. And when you look at our cash flow for the year, which is where we focus because of the timing of these working capital issues that I went through, other than the 3Rs and of course Concentra, we're actually reasonably in line. As you know, we took up our cash flow last quarter, and I think were it not for some of these other adjustments that I just discussed, we would be in pretty good stead there.","Christine Arnold","Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","We appreciate the support the shareholders are providing us. We recognize that this quarter is a complicated quarter as a result of our Concentra sale, as a result of some of the changes in the comparison. But we do believe it is a quarter that continues to reconfirm the organization strategy around our growth in retail and in addition the integrated delivery model.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Humana Incorporated 3Q 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would like to turn the call over to Amy Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our third quarter 2018 results and our financial outlook for the year.","Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts.","This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.","Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our third quarter 2018 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.","Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.58 for the third quarter of 2018 and raised our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $14.40, primarily reflecting favorable Medicare Advantage results.","Our continued strong performance reflects the advancement of our strategy, which centers on the consumer with quality, convenience and local presence top of mind throughout the organization. Our success is due to the exemplary efforts of our associates and their focus on quality every step of the way. We're fortunate to have a highly engaged team and are encouraged by a recently completed survey indicating that engagement levels of our associates rank as world-class, above the 90 percentile.","This engagement reflects a culture of commitment to our values and strategy, diversity of thought and pride in the services we provide our customers. You see it not only in our recently released Star scores including two 5-star contracts in key markets, but also in higher Net Promoter Scores and improved productivity.","It was also recently announced that Humana Pharmacy was ranked number one in customer satisfaction for U.S. mail order pharmacies in the J.D. Power 2018, U.S. Pharmacy Study. Ultimately, all these efforts result in deeper member engagement and improved clinical outcomes.","While we are proud of our Star scores, we recognize that there is an inherent volatility in their measurements and healthcare is a dynamic environment. Measures may change, and as the industry as a whole improves performance, measure thresholds also rise substantially. Therefore, this requires a relentless focus on quality in both of the member experience and clinical outcomes throughout the organization.","To that end, we continue to invest in people, processes and technology to create a more local, personalized and simplified experience, while proactively managing health conditions.","Let me give you a few examples. We continue to make progress with Kindred at Home and our efforts already being felt by our members. There are numerous examples of Kindred at Home nurses and our four pilot programs identifying and addressing gaps in care, including addressing non-medical patient concerns that may cause them to forgo the recommended pre or post-acute treatment plan and jeopardize their health. Kindred at Home's direct engagement and information sharing with the health plan further enables our members to make decisions that are best for their personal health and well-being.","Similarly, our medication reconciliation program is leading to better clinical outcomes for our members. We implemented and then performed our first medication reconciliation nearly three years ago. In the beginning, it took three months to complete 500 medication reconciliations. We now can do it in three days with the use of technology. We've heard countless stories from our care managers and pharmacists around the impact we're having on members' lives through this program.","Together, our clinicians have caught drug interactions, duplicate therapies, missing therapies, incorrect therapies and side effects. Our analytics team have spent considerable time working through the data, catching important discrepancies and ensuring accurate results. We've prevented hospital readmissions and adverse drug events and are generating significant trend savings through this program annually. And our members experience the value of this work through more healthy days in their home.","We've seen similar success in our value-based care model with primary care physicians. In our wholly-owned Partners in Primary Care clinics, one story in particular stands out. A member at one of our clinics, Mr. Smith a high-risk patient with elevated A1C, frequently missed his appointments. By proactively reaching out to him, the clinic staff determined that while he understood that he was at high risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and losing his vision, he could not afford the $15 co-pay for the office visit, medication co-pays or healthy foods. He was fully aware of the consequences and felt hopeless.","The clinical staff worked with him to address financial concerns that were a barrier to his ability to manage his disease progression. He was already receiving 100% low-income subsidy for his prescriptions and still couldn't afford the $8 co-pays or the $15 co-pay for the office visit. So, the clinic staff found other ways to help him financially.","This includes referring Mr. Smith to a food pantry, even entering the address in his GPS phone for him; assisting him with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP application, under which he was pre-approved for $135 to $165 in benefits; informing him that if he use those SNAP benefits at the local farmers market, for every $5 he spent on produce, he would be given an additional $10 in fresh produce; helping him apply for low-income housing supplement that would pay at least 50% of his rent; and assisting him in calling the power company to obtain a low-income reduction in his power bill.","Mr. Smith was appreciative of the assistance and indicated the savings to his budget were life-changing for him. There are stories like this across the organization. At the root of all of them is the success of our integrated care delivery model, breaking down silos, empowering Humana associates and encouraging partnering across the healthcare ecosystem.","We recognize that in order to slow disease progression, improve the health of those we serve and ultimately reduce medical costs, we have to solve the barriers to achieving better health outcomes for our members. Those barriers often occur outside the medical realm, including social determinants of health, like food insecurity and social isolation, as well as financial constraints.","In addition, consumer convenience and local presence are top of mind as they lead to increased member engagement. To that end, we've invested in home health, an expansion of our senior-focused primary care clinic footprint, including opening two clinics inside Walgreens stores in Kansas City as previously discussed.","In addition, we recognize that we need an omni-channel approach to consumer convenience and healthcare with a seamless experience for members and providers whether interacting with us over the phone or online through a desktop or mobile device.","In August, we announced that we named Heather Cox to the newly created position of Chief Digital Health and Analytics Officer. And we'll soon launch a center for Digital Health and Analytics in Boston called Humana Studio H. We are developing a critical capability that can help Humana leap forward and overcome friction points to create a simplified, connected and personalized health care experience for our members, physicians and other medical professionals who provide care. CDRH will focus on pioneering new products and services that will then be developed for use across the organization and with external parties.","Turning to 2019, our commitment to helping our members achieve their best health remains stronger than ever. There were meaningful tailwinds going into 2019 Medicare Advantage bids, including among others, Tax Reform and the health insurance industry fee moratorium, enabling us to make investments in our products to benefit our members and drive improved health outcomes.","We are pleased with the early positive response to our compelling Medicare Advantage offerings with nearly all of our members experiencing stable or enhanced benefits. Based on our 2018 membership base, I would like to highlight ways our members will benefit from our plans in 2019.","93% of our members will have no premium change or will see a reduction in premium. Over 50% of our members will have $0 premium plan. 1.6 million members will have $0 primary care physician co-pay, an increase of 400,000 members for 2018, and nearly all members will have a PCP co-pay of $20 or less. Nearly 40% of our members will see specialist co-pay reductions. Over 430,000 members are in plans from which prescription drug deductibles have been removed in 2019, bringing the number of total members with no Rx deductible to 1.3 million. And finally, 1 million members, or 36%, will see reductions in their maximum out-of-pocket expenses.","When designing these benefits, we knew it was important to offer a compelling value proposition to our customers to drive growth, while also balancing the need to improve our margins at the same time. We have robust operational processes and controls in place both at corporate and local market level to ensure we achieve both of these objectives.","As Brian will discuss in his remarks, early indicators from the Annual Election Period are positive, reflecting member and broker excitement around these changes. Consequently, we are expecting strong individual Medicare Advantage growth, while also delivering an increase in earnings per share above our long-term target. We look forward to helping both our current and new members achieve their best health.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $4.58 for the third quarter, ahead of our previous expectations. We continue to see favorable results, particularly in our Retail segment. And as a consequence, for the third time this year, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $14.40 from our previous guidance of approximately $14.15.","These strong financial results, coupled with solid non-financial metrics that are also a component of our compensation programs, are driving an increase in estimated incentive-based compensation for our associates across all segments, thereby increasing our consolidated operating cost ratio guidance for the full year.","Recall that earlier this year, due to Tax Reform, we were able to significantly expand our annual incentive-based compensation program to include all of our associates. These added approximately 28,000 associates to the annual program, tying a portion of their pay to the company's performance.","As a result of their tireless efforts and commitment to our strategy, we are continuing to outperform our expectations. And we are therefore pleased to have the opportunity to further reward all of our associates for their exemplary work.","As I mentioned, our Retail segment continues to outperform, led by our individual Medicare Advantage business. We've increased our individual MA membership guidance for 2018 to a range of 200,000 to 210,000, an increase of 15,000 members at the midpoint, partially offset by slightly lower than expected group MA membership. This greater Medicare membership, coupled with higher per member per month premiums, have enabled us to increase our revenue guidance to a range of $47.8 billion to $48.1 billion from our previous range of $47.5 billion to $48 billion.","In addition, the trends seen in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter, with inpatient utilization running favorably, partially offset by higher outpatient costs. As a result, we've again lowered our benefit ratio guidance to a range of 85.0% to 85.4% as compared to our previous guidance range of 85.1% to 86.0%.","While the lower utilization is good for the health plans in the Retail segment and Humana overall, it does put some pressure on Healthcare Services segment adjusted EBITDA. In fact, we are seeing the benefits of the investments we have made in our integrated business model and strong clinical programs over the last several years, reflected in clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines.","Accordingly, our associates in the Healthcare Services segment will also benefit proportionately from the consolidated company outperformance with higher than expected incentive-based compensation, which is an important factor driving the lower adjusted EBITDA guidance for the segment we have provided today.","Additionally, MAPD pharmacy network volume is down slightly for the year versus expectations, primarily with generics. And we have also experienced shifting market dynamics in our Specialty Pharmacy business, primarily around members' initial engagement in new therapies, which have tended to be filled by third-party providers rather than Humana Pharmacy. The pharmacy team is intently focused on improving these dynamics.","These factors, coupled with investments made in Conviva, which include accelerated rebranding to position this business for a strong Annual Election Period to bolster 2019, resulted in a decline in our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $990 million to $1.01 billion from our previous range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion.","Lastly, I would note that Kindred at Home is performing in line with our expectations and the value-based pilots we have launched have begun to gain traction, as Bruce indicated in his remarks.","Shifting to Group and Specialty, the segment is still expected to perform within the range of our prior expectations from a pre-tax perspective. For this quarter, we slightly lowered the high end of the pre-tax range on account of extraordinary items.","During the third quarter, several developments, including the resolution of provider matters in Texas and Florida, which were not previously contemplated in our guidance, resulted in an increase in our benefit ratio guidance to a range of 79.1% to 79.5% from our previous guidance range of 78.3% to 78.8%. The resolution of these issues sets the segment up for success in the future.","We continue to expect trend of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, but trending towards the lower half of the range. Additionally, our TRICARE business continues to perform very well and exceed expectations.","Turning now to 2019, while we do not intend to provide specific detailed guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher-level commentary and direction for the upcoming year.","Let me first reiterate that we have significant tailwinds going into 2019 with minimal headwinds. Tailwinds include the positive Medicare Rate Notice, the HIF moratorium, the continued beneficial effects of Tax Reform, our incremental membership from the Statewide Florida Medicaid contract award, and our general Medicare business momentum.","In addition, we now have two 5-star contracts in the critical markets of Florida and Tennessee that give us the ability to market year-round. More broadly, we have endeavored to be very thoughtful with how we balanced our 2019 goals of achieving a greater than market individual MA membership increase, while at the same time improving our pre-tax margin to drive EPS growth above our long-term target.","Let's begin with membership. As Bruce indicated in his remarks, we believe that our solid membership and earnings growth in 2018 is paving the way for significant growth in 2019 and we are pleased with the positive early response to our individual MA offerings for 2019 during the first month of the Annual Election Period.","The significant tailwinds just discussed allowed us to invest in benefits for our members and offer compelling Medicare Advantage products. In addition, in 2018, we continued the extensive broker outreach that we began in 2017, revitalizing and deepening these critical relationships as we geared up for the 2019 Annual Election Period.","Based on what we know today, we expect 2019 individual MA membership growth in the range of 250,000 to 300,000 members. There are scenarios that could certainly impact this estimate including a sales slowdown or speedup for the remainder of AEP; a change in the expected retention of existing members for which we've limited data to-date; higher or lower post-AEP sales figures that are currently forecasted; and the return of the open enrollment period for 2019 for the first time since 2011.","The OEP runs from January to March, allowing members to make a single switch of their MA plan or return to original Medicare. With regard to group Medicare Advantage, as we've indicated previously, growth can vary significantly from one year to the next depending on the large account RFP pipeline, which for 2019 was less robust than prior years. That said, we still expect to grow our membership by approximately 30,000 members year-over-year.","Moving to Medicaid, we expect 2019 membership growth of 120,000 to 140,000 members, primarily reflecting the expansion into new regions with the Florida contract award. Regarding our standalone Medicare PDP membership, as previously discussed, we expect this business will face meaningful headwinds for 2019. Given the competitive nature of the industry and the price discipline we are employing, we are no longer the low-cost plan in any market. We expect 2019 PDP membership losses to be at least 500,000 members.","Finally, we anticipate that our Group and Specialty segment will see an overall medical membership decline, though not at the level of declined experienced in 2018. That being said, we do expect to grow modestly in our sweet spot of 2,000 to 1,000 members with a big focus on expanding our level-funded premium products that are very attractive to small employers.","I will now turn to our expectations around 2019 financial performance. We expect the membership changes discussed above will drive sizable top line and pre-tax growth as well as margin improvement in our Retail segment.","As we indicated previously, while we expect our individual MA pre-tax margins to improve nicely from 2018, we anticipate they will remain below our long-term target of 4.5% to 5% on account of the continued impact of investments made in 2018 due to Tax Reform. We remain fully committed to achieving our long-term target over time.","With regard to the Healthcare Services segment, we expect adjusted EBITDA percentage growth in the low-teens, given our individual MA membership growth expectations, the annualization of the Kindred results and operational improvements in our other businesses in the segment, particularly our Conviva provider clinics. However, a decline in PDP membership has the impact of constraining the growth of our pharmacy business, which will therefore rely on Medicare Advantage growth and improved operations to fuel its results.","Lastly, in our Group and Specialty segment, while we expect our insurance businesses to have nice pre-tax growth in 2019, this will be more than offset by the previously discussed lower TRICARE profits, given that the positive final settlements received in 2018 associated with the previous TRICARE contract will not recur in 2019. Therefore, we anticipate that pre-tax results will be modestly down year-over-year in this segment.","All-in, we are pleased to reiterate our expectation of meaningful EPS growth in 2019 of a new baseline of $14.40 in excess of our long-term target of 11% to 15%. More specifically, we would expect the midpoint of our initial guidance range to be slightly above the current consensus estimate of $17.18.","Before I open up the line for questions, I also wanted to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on March 19, 2019 in New York City. Please save the date.","With that, we will open up the lines for your questions. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, everybody. Maybe following up on those comments just made about Medicare Advantage growth. A quick back-on-the-envelope would suggest that you're thinking your individual business will grow 8% to 10% next year. I wonder if you could put that in perspective with you think that's an in line with the market growth, better than the market growth, if I calculated that, right.","And then secondarily on the MA comment, I think a lot of your outperformance this year has been in the MA margin area. And I guess if you're saying you won't quite get to the 4.5% to 5% target next year, is that \u2013 are you sort of close to that now, given the outperformance you've seen and expect \u2013 whatever you expect for fourth quarter? Or what does the year-to-year trend look like on margin?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Well, good morning, A.J. As it relates to market growth, let me just provide a little context of how we view the market. This year being 2018, we expect the market to grow in, call it, the 7-plus percent range, maybe 7.5%. We'll see where it ends up. Again, I'm talking on the individual MA side.","For 2018, it's conceivable that goes up modestly. We'll see where that ends. The reality is we don't have a lot of market data just yet. We have anecdotal data that suggest that we are taking market share from our competitors. And so the, call it, 8-plus percent to 10% growth that you cited, we do believe that that is a performance above market. We'll see where that goes.","And obviously, we'll also see where we end up on our AEP results and our rest-of-year results. It's still very early. We feel very good about the 250,000 to 300,000 member target that we put out. And obviously, we're working hard to drive growth above that range.","I would say on the margin side, again, without providing specifics on our margin, we remain, notwithstanding the significant outperformance this year, significantly below our 4.5% to 5% margin target in 2018. I mean, it's important to remember the context of that initial margin guide that we gave. We had a number of headwinds, including the HIF coming back, a difficult flu season, the fact that we actually grew faster than we initially anticipated, and as I said, the significant Tax Reform investments, which we reinvested in our associates and in our communities and in the integrated care delivery model.","So we do expect to make nice margin improvement in 2019 off that 2018 base, which, as you indicated, is coming in above our initial guidance, but we still do expect to be below that target for 2019.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next caller, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. Following up on the MA margin question, where would you see the medical loss ratio on a normalized basis? I guess, from the revenue side next year, you're getting \u2013 your Star ratings are solid for 2019 and the risk floating rate looks great. Why is it that the loss ratio couldn't go down? Are you coming up against some MLR floor barriers or is it something else that's holding it back?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Look, there's obviously always opportunity to continue to push the MER better. But as we think about the world, we really think about it in pre-tax margin terms because there's a lot of levers that we pull between the medical costs and then the operating costs. And as you know from coming into 2018, we spent a significant amount of effort across the company trying to drive down that admin spend. And we took out many hundreds of millions of dollars this year to fund that benefit design.","And so I'd rather not comment specifically on the components between MER and AER. I would just reiterate our long-term margin target, which we're focusing in ultimately getting back to.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And then, again, related to this long-term target, where do you see your operating cost ratio? On a consolidated basis, it's still in the low teens and there should be at least leverage there as you're doing your business. And then, on the \u2013 secondly on the value-based care, when you report your employed physicians and this partial risk and full risk, they looks like they're not changing much. So what are the trend benders that you're driving for a lower or improved medical cost structure at this point?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","So I'll point you back to the comments I just made on the various ratios. The only thing I would say on the operating cost ratio is that we continue to work on productivity initiatives, on process transformation across the enterprise to drive costs out of the system. It's I think really become part of the DNA of this organization that every year we're going to get better and better and drive productivity.","If you look at our administrative costs on an apples-to-apples basis, if you adjust for mix, adjust for the health insurance fee, you'll see a pretty dramatic reduction year-over-year, again, taking into account also Tax Reform. You want to take, yeah.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Good morning, Ana. On the value-based question you had, what you're seeing is as much about the amount of physicians that are in value-based payments versus the quality. And what we've seen over the last few years is really our focus on improving where providers are being in the surplus and they're actually making more money off of the value-based payments.","And that has been our orientation versus the volume, Ana. We don't report the surplus, but you would see, if we did a significant improvement in the number of providers that are in surplus payments.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Helpful color. Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Thanks.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Could you just talk about \u2013 I know you stressed stronger broker outreach as a factor driving the results that you're seeing in open enrollment. How much of that has to do with maybe catching up to, if that's the right way to put it, the compensation that maybe some of your competitors have been offering? And where do you see that broker compensation going as a competitive factor?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Hey, Matt. Good morning.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","It's less about compensation. I think most of our competitors really pay the CMS max levels, that's typical across the industry. It's really about the support that you provide them. And really, we think about support in two buckets. One is the tools they have to interact with us and how easy is it to engage with us digitally as well as in other forms. So that when they try to understand the nature of their book, how they're doing, enrolling members who might have started an online application and how easy is it to finish, how easy is it to track, how they're doing from a results perspective, how quickly do we respond to requests that they need and support that they need, and then there's also marketing dollars and putting muscle behind that so that when they're out trying to drum up sales and leads, we're there supporting them.","And then, there's the intangible element of a relationship where our Medicare leadership has done a wonderful job of driving those relationships. I think there's a personal bond there, which is very important in that business. And so I think when you look across the range of levers we can pull to drive those relationships, they've improved meaningfully. Part of it's a catch-up I would say because I think we were damaged, as we've said, by the Aetna transaction with the brokers, but I think we've more than made up for it.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. If I could just ask one more. I think you alluded to some negative skew in the commercial fully-insured group risk pool that's resulting from healthier groups migrating to self-funding or quasi self-funding options. There is a potential for that to spiral, particularly if there's traction on the association health plans on the low end of the group side. What's your outlook there?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Well, I think what you're saying is right. I mean, if you're particularly a healthy group and you're in a community-rated pool, you may not be getting the best rate. And so, we have seen a material uptick in our sales of what we call our ASO level-funded products, which is effectively self-funding with a stop-loss wrap to give them out-of-the-money protection in the event that the health care costs spike.","We've seen that be particularly compelling. It's still too early really to comment on the association health plans. We'll see where those go, but we're actually quite bullish on this level-funded product and we've seen significant growth there. And it also, we think, plays to our strengths, which is our ability to understand risk and price it accordingly. So we're actually pretty bullish on that move.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Next question, please? And as a reminder, please try to limit yourselves to one question.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I'll do my one question in a couple of parts here, I apologize. First, on your membership guidance, do you expect the 80% to 90% of that individual growth to come during open enrollment, similar to what we've seen during the last few years? Or would those 5-star plans skew this a bit? And then, how does your retention rate assumption look for 2019 versus what you saw in 2018? And then just lastly, can you tell us what the HIF benefit is to the earnings number implied in guidance? Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. That was impressive. There are three questions.","Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.","Way to get in three.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","All right. In order. On the AEP\/rest-of-year mix, we've generally assumed a similar mix in our budgets here in the forecast we gave. To the extent that the 5-star plan really takes off and with our value prop being pretty strong, hopefully we can exceed that, but I think it's prudent to assume a similar AEP, what we call, ROY, AEP\/ROY mix, and we'll see where that ultimately goes.","I wouldn't underestimate the importance of the 5-star contract, particularly being in Florida and Tennessee, these are markets where we have important risk relationships with our providers. They're very high-performing markets for us and there's obviously a lot of opportunity in those markets. So we're particularly excited about achieving 5-stars there. We'll see how that manifests itself into higher growth.","On the retention rate, broadly, we've assumed a similar retention rate as we did in 2018. There are some tweaks here and there, but I'd say in the ballpark of similar. So as I said in my remarks, it's still pretty early on the retention side because typically, terms lag sales, and you don't really learn about a term until you hear from the other carrier that someone signed up there. So it takes a little longer to process. So we think we've done the appropriate thing and assume a largely consistent retention rate.","With regard to the HIF, I'd rather not break out the HIF versus the other components. As we've said in multiple contexts, we really think about all the financial levers as one pool of dollars that we look to allocate out between growing benefits and helping our members in achieving growth as well as driving margin. So I'd rather not piece that out separately.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I applaud your goals of spreading the tailwinds between stronger earnings and better member benefits and maybe employee incentive compensation. There's perhaps a fourth bucket of higher spending that's perhaps something you can only do next year that you can get away from in 2020 without some adverse consequence if the HIF comes back in 2020. What is your plan for if the HIF comes back in 2020?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I would say, Peter, that it would be consistent with what we did this year and continue to focus on the improved productivity. I would probably disagree a little bit. We look at our spending in a pretty cautious fashion every year and I wouldn't say next year just because we have headwind \u2013 I mean tailwinds that we would be overinvesting. I think we continue to look at how we can improve margin and improve productivity in the company and at the same time, drive a customer value proposition that is competitive in the marketplace. So I recognize that the HIF is always a challenge to predict, but we as an organization look at that as a way to approach that would be continue to drive our productivity up.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So if the HIF comes back in 2020, which of the other buckets then would you squeeze back? Would it be earnings? Would it be member benefits? What exactly would you squeeze?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. I mean we continue to maintain committed to improving our margin growing at a market rate that is between 11% and 15% level, our earnings per share growth rate, and at the same time continuing to be committed to our value proposition in the marketplace. And every year, we are constantly trying to find that ability to meet all three of those. And I would consider 2020 no different than any other year that we have.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I just wanted to go to the Part D losses that you're expecting for next year. I guess you've seen kind of an erosion of your market-leading position in the last couple of years. I mean, how important is it to have that position? I guess, A, is there anything that you can do to move back into being a low-cost plan in those markets? And then, B, does that have a secondary effect on your Medicare business, because I guess one of the benefits that you give away in Medicare Advantage is a cheap Part D plan. So to the extent that you no longer have that advantage on Part D, does that hurt your growth outlook?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I'll start and then I'll look to Brian to add commentary. I would say that, first, you just see the organization continuing to focus on pricing discipline here, and we've done this in other times when we see the market getting a little astray. We did it in group a few years ago. You see it now in PDP. You see it in group commercial where we just don't want to follow the market down. And the consequence is that we're going to lose membership.","What we do see is both because of our brand and commitment to our service levels that we do see a higher conversion from Part D to Medicare Advantage and the success of that, and we continue to believe that. Now, keep in mind, this is on a 5 million membership base. So as we talk about 500,000, it's large, but it's still an absolute, as a percentage, is not catastrophic by no means.","In meeting the future growth rate, we'll continue to be price disciplined in the marketplace. We'll continue to focus on our service levels. And at times, we might add other components to the program. But I would say that you will continue to see us wait this through because we don't think that the market can continue to offer the pricing that's in the marketplace and continue to have a sustainable product. And I think we're just going to wait this through and see what happens at the other end. Brian, do you have any other comment to make?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","No, I think that's good.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. So LabCorp recently talked about their growth strategy being linked to locating their 600 labs and Walgreens expansions in the same locations that has clinical assets or primary care or urgent care. And I know it's early in the Kansas City rollout, but can you talk about any results in increased foot traffic or level of consumer interactions with the information booth that you've seen that could influence your decision to expand the JV realistically? How quickly could that happen? And do you have any data that helps you frame up what an incremental touch point with a potential MA customer could mean to influencing their future buying decisions to buy Humana's MA plan? Thanks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yes. I think first thing that we've seen is that the convenience of the store is highly appreciative. We've seen that the traffic that goes into these particular clinics is more \u2013 has increased as a result of the location and just the branding of it. And so we find that just in its initial opening. And keep in mind, it's been open only about three weeks now, so we're very early in it.","The second thing we do see is that, as a result of that increased interest, we do see Humana being more discussed as both from a health plan point of view, but also from just a primary care clinic point of view. So we are very positive and excited about the exposure it provides. And then in addition, we find that it does offer another opportunity for the Retail side where they've seen increased urgent care visits in the back of the store.","The last thing that we've seen in early part is the fact that we are influencing people's health. We've seen similar stories as what I articulated on the call of being able to help people with financial needs and financing and getting support for their prescriptions. We've also seen the area in being able to help them and understand their benefits. And then in addition, in some of health areas, we've been able to influence their health decisions along with prescription management. And so we've seen the other areas of supporting the individual as being very positive.","So, to summarize it, great exposure, we see more foot traffic. We see engagement being greater as a result of our health coaches being there. And then in addition, I think the Retail side is seeing some benefit as a result of that, both in the urgent care area, but I think in general part of the store.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So it sounds like all positives there in such a short period. How should we think about the framework for your evaluation of deciding to expand it and how long that process could take to make that decision?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. I think we have a great relationship with both Walmart and Walgreens and we'll continue to build on that relationship. I suspect that we will do some other stores before we conclude on this particular offering as a result of the initial indication and the learnings from this. And I think being able to do a few more stores will also give us the confidence in being able to scale it.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Questions around Medicare Advantage and the outlook for next year. Strong growth. It sounds like you're expecting to be slightly above industry. And so I'm curious what you're seeing from the competition. You've gotten to look at sort of competitor plan design, et cetera. So is your expectation \u2013 it sounds like retention is the same, that you're taking share from competitors? Has there been a change in that competitive landscape? Or is this still really, no, we're just going to continue to take share as an industry from fee-for-service?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, I think what we've seen \u2013 again, it's anecdotal and it's really hard to say because we don't have true industry data, but the broker chatter that we hear is that we are taking share from our competitors. So our sales being nicely above \u2013 in some cases, meaningfully above our existing market share.","But, again, it's way too early to make that this positive because we just don't know where the industry is, and we obviously don't have visibility on all the sales that are occurring. But the early indicators are positive, that we're taking share.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","So I guess the follow-up to that is, does that make it sound like you're not seeing a competitive response or a change in the market that you find troublesome? You're not seeing new competition or more aggressive change in benefits from competitors or anything like that. It sounds like it's more manageable in your mind.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes, I think so. I mean, I would say it's a local market phenomena. We see in certain markets that there are certain players who tend to be quite aggressive and then there are other markets where it tends to be more rational. Frankly, you see that every year that there are some people who want to make a bet on a particular market for various reasons. And so I wouldn't say we've seen any difference in terms of rationality of pricing this year. Clearly, there's a lot of additional money coming from the health insurance fee being on holiday and some of the Rate Notice and other things. And so I think as an industry, benefits have improved. And I think it goes to the importance of the health insurance fee for our beneficiaries. And so from that perspective we have seen increased benefits, but I wouldn't say there's been anything irrational with some exceptions in certain markets. But that's really par for the course.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the helpful color. One question I guess on just cost trend. I guess it's probably fair to assume it's been decelerating and maybe even more recently. Hoping to kind of get some color there, maybe confirm that. And the other part of that is really just understanding what was assumed for trend in your bids for next year and kind of baked into the initial earnings outlook.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. I would say on the trend side, it's really consistent with what we've talked about the last few quarters in terms of this shift from inpatient to outpatient, that hasn't let up. We continue to see that. I would just say on 2019 trend, we try to be very prudent about the numbers we put in our bids, and so \u2013 but I'd rather not comment beyond that. We've obviously reflected what we've seen this year into the 2019 experience.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. I had a question about 2020 looking ahead. We estimate that the Stars there will increase your bonus of those \u2013 in the bonus by about 10 points to 84%. Obviously, knowing rates is going to be important part of your view on 2020, but curious if the increased visibility on Stars there helps provide confidence that you could return to your target margin of 4.5% to 5% by that point.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Well, I think the Stars results obviously are very positive and I think indicative, as Bruce said in his remarks, of the quality focus that our organization has. And I think really, the great effort of the Stars team and working again across businesses and across silos and departments to drive a great result for our members, which manifest itself in better Stars.","I think what you said is really important, obviously, in terms of where the Rate Notice ultimately shakes out and what happens with the health insurance fee. Those are really important factors as we think about what our 2020 ultimate bidding strategy will be and what that means for margin. So we're not prepared today to give 2020 guidance. We're just giving indicators of 2019, so we'll have to stay tuned for that. But I would just say, as Bruce said earlier in the call, that we're obviously very mindful of all the commitments that we have and goals that we have to drive both growth and margin.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Bruce and Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Bruce the color on all of Humana's enhanced benefit design for individual MA for 2019 was definitely helpful when you provided that earlier. This was kind of touched on a little bit, but I guess I had somewhat of a similar question around, do you think you're unique among individual MA players in moving the needle as much as you did with the enhanced MA benefits for 2019? I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is maybe just to phrase it slightly differently. I mean, would you characterize 2019 as more of a go for the gold type year for Humana regarding attempted individual MA membership growth? Or do you view 2019 as more business as usual with the levers that you're pulling to drive membership growth for next year?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Yeah. I would characterize it as more business as usual. I think one of the reasons why you see such improvement in benefits is because we, I think as an industry, have invested back into the benefits both to be competitive but a number of things like HIF that should be included in the benefits. So I think you've just seen the continued belief that the areas that we can improve in whether it's our medical costs trend or in addition, the rate increases, or for that matter, the tax benefits that we've received. We'll be mindful about margin, but at the same time be mindful of being competitive in the marketplace. I think if you were to compare our benefits on a (00:52:56) value, you will see us be fairly competitive, but not be the cheapest.","We've always tried to maintain to be at a level in the industry where we are in the tier to be selected, but not to be the cheapest in the marketplace. We feel our brand, our service and our longevity of stable benefits has always served us well over time, and we continue to see that being the case.","The last thing I think is, over the last two years, we've invested in the benefits to overcome some of the deterioration that was taking place in the 2015, 2016 timeframe, especially during the Aetna transaction, and I think a little bit of last year was catch-up. This year put us in a competitive area, but I really would emphasize its competitiveness, but not overzealous.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the extra color. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. I have a question on the recent proposal on MA policy changes for 2020. So if CMS finalizes its decision to extrapolate the RADV Audits without a fee-for-service adjuster, would there be any impact on what you've already reserved for to settle past audits? And also, would there be any noticeable impact on booking of revenues on an ongoing basis?","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Yes. I would just say that we're still reviewing the proposed rule, but we believe the proposal does not satisfy actuarial equivalence as required under the Medicare statute. And again, it's a proposed rule and we certainly plan to comment. But as we've said before, we feel very confident around our practices in this area. And I would just leave it at that.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned before that, starting next year, a number of your members will have reduced premiums or $0 policies. And I think in one spot, you talked about a number of your members will have $0 pharmacy deductibles. Can you talk about when you go to that kind of a structure, what kind of changes do you make in formulary to control costs? And are any of those things able to help maybe stem the tide in your PDP book? And is there sort of a steady state in terms of membership there we should be thinking about as you model out to the future? Or should we continue to think about maybe a slow gradual decline and think of it more as a maybe some shift into your MA products as that. Thanks.","Brian A. Kane - Humana, Inc.","Sure. Well, I'd sort of differentiate as two separate questions, one on formulary. I would say, we're very thoughtful on formulary. And obviously, there are a number of drugs that are protected and therefore they have to be covered. Others where we have the ability to incent one drug over the other, we use that as a way to what we call drive a trend bender and effectively get a better rate from the manufacturer, which we can pass back in the form of better benefits. And so I would say we're very thoughtful around our formulary approach. And we spend a lot of time on, obviously, ensuring that our members get the coverage that they need and us doing it in the most efficient and costly way possible.","As it relates to PDP formulary is obviously a part of that. There's a whole host of things that go into PDP. As Bruce said, what we've seen is some aggressive pricing on the PDP side that we haven't been willing to chase. We think there is some cross-subsidization going on potentially, with we think, with some of the retailers there to drive people into the store that perhaps gives them a different perspective than we might have. We do view PDP as a pipeline into MA. That was a percentage of our MA sales. It's still relatively small, but it's still an opportunity that we see as potentially exciting.","And I would say, going forward, we're certainly not surrendering the PDP market by any means. We're going to have to be innovative and differentiated. I think if you look back several years, we basically pioneered the low-price product through the Walmart plan. And that was really a revolutionary product in the industry that allowed us to get a number one market share, and our relationship with Walmart has been very strong. And so we got to continue to innovate and provide perhaps different kinds of benefits to our members and think through what will appeal to them going forward. But we're just going to be thoughtful going forward. We're not going to chase price, but we also want to grow the PDP business ultimately.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","And similar to all our plans or all our plans, we're very conscious about having a balanced customer base that is from a condition point of view. And so when we think about it, we also think about it just from the type of customers we would attract to ensure that it has its proper pricing there. So in this particular case, we're not concerned about adverse selection.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. You guys had previously cited the 2018 Budget Act as a possible catalyst to potentially seek a Medicaid platform, basically given your desire to participate in SNP growth and the requirement to have long term \u2013 or capitated Medicaid contracts in order to participate in SNP beyond 2021. Do you think the final rule still requires that? There was this sort of provision about if you didn't have state-capitated contracts on the Medicaid side is you could do some notification around high-risk populations, so basically sort of implying providing data to the state would satisfy the integration requirement. Does that change your view on contemplating a deeper move into Medicaid?","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","I think just in general, just to reconfirm our interest and continued growth in Medicaid, and it continues to be high as we believe and have continue to believe over the years that the dual population being highly chronic in the senior population and disability is a great market for us to serve with our clinical programs. We continue to believe that our organic capabilities, as proven by Florida and some other states that we've won, is very, very competitive and we will continue to do that.","At the same time, we will continue to add our capabilities, and specifically in the procurement process, in areas and states that we feel is complementary to the existing membership we have and continue to be on the look out there.","Specific to your question on the proposed rules that are being made, we do feel it provides more clarity around what the rules are and specifically that the state does not dictate of what a D-SNP plan is required that we would have more flexibility in offering D-SNP or related planning. And I think that clarity gives us more confidence that in certain states that we'll continue to be offering a D-SNP plan without having that procurement of the Medicaid side. But that doesn't deter us from still focusing on the Medicaid and continuing to focus on winning contracts both organically and when necessary and if \u2013 in the appropriate time be acquiring a Medicaid platform.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at the moment. Mr. Bruce Broussard, please continue for your closing remarks.","Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.","Well, like always, we thank everyone's support and investing and the confidence in the company. So thank you very much.

Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this morning's call refer to diluted earnings per common share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.","Bruce Broussard","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number of challenges, as well as some new opportunities.","Humana continues to rise to these challenges through our consumer focused strategy and integrated care delivery model, while simultaneously investing in new growth areas. As a result, we are reiterating our guidance for 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share, a growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint.","As we outlined in our Investor Day this past December, Humana\u2019s investment thesis is driven by our customer focused, integrated care delivery model and the related results. This thesis includes four key elements, continued robust organic membership and revenue growth, proven superior clinical operating performance, disciplined capital allocation, which all lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.","I will begin our discussion this morning with a focus on our membership and revenue growth. We recently raised our net Medicare Advantage membership growth expectations for 2015 to 300,000 to 350,000, primarily as a result of a strong sales during our -- result of strong sales during the recently completed annual election period or AEP.","And looking at the January enrollment data from CMS, Humana continues to lead the industry in membership growth for individual Medicare Advantage plans. The CMS data indicates that Humana accounted for nearly 70% of the individual MA net enrolment growth across the sector. In fact, approximately 52% of our individual gross sales during the AEP came from competitor Medicare Advantage offerings.","From a geographic perspective, we do not see strong specific concentration with this growth, but did experience our highest membership gains in North Carolina. We are pleased with this individual MA growth as it complements the Group MA membership increased we experienced in that state in 2014, making this a very important Humana market. With a large base of Medicare members, we are now able to bring other Humana offerings like HumanaOne to the state.","As you'll see from slide eight, approximately 73% of our individual MA net growth was in HMO offerings, including current Humana members, who chose to move to an -- into an HMO in 2015. This compares to 64% in 2014.","Our HMO offerings continue to provide the highest level of engagement from both a member and provider perspective, and also have the highest retention rate of our Medicare products.","Over the past few years, we have discussed our integrated care delivery model and its three core elements, improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction resulting in a trusting relationship, based on a trusting relationship engage members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement.","This strategy has provided superior clinical operating performance resulting in a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the past few years membership growth in Star scores provide evidence of the success of this strategy.","We believe there are five key points of influence that drive our superior clinical operating performance. Although, I will not go through all the detail on this slide today, I did want to highlight, how we are already been working with our -- our new 2015 members, allowing us to begin to get to know them and allow for timely enrollment in the proper clinical programs.","I'll begin with wellness and prevention, staying in tune with the help of our members is a major focus of our wellness and prevention efforts. This all begins with our new member welcome call. These calls begin shortly after the onset of the AEP this past October. These outreach efforts have already resulted in the completion of over 160,000 health risk assessments.","Data from the welcome calls, health risk assessments and our sophisticated predictive modeling have already come together to identify more than 46,000 of our members for referrals to our Humana At Home.","Our wellness efforts have a strong focus on gaps in care. In 2014, we closed approximately 4.3 million gaps in care for our members, driven by improvements in preventative screenings. Better still, we are very pleased that approximately 1.3 million of our members across all lines of business received preventative treatment on schedule.","Turning to the primary care point of influence, we are pleased to report that approximately 55% of our net membership growth during the AEP is for members associated with providers and value-based arrangements. Remember that we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care. This includes performance bonuses, shared savings, and shared risk relationships.","We see HHS announcement last week on its move to paying providers based on value as further validation that our integrated care delivery strategy is on track. We look forward to working with HHS in developing new payment models and continuing to assist providers in the transition to value-based payment.","Healthcare At Home will also be an important element of the care for many of our new members. As we\u2019ve shared with you in the past, our Humana At Home programs do a terrific job of providing members with clinical support and care that often results in a significantly higher number of days they spend at their homes instead of in an acute care facility.","Importantly, as we evaluate each of the points of influence I have just described, as well as our pharmacy interactions with our members, we utilized advanced analytics, including sophisticated predictive models, to provide insights that are both actionable and drive value for our members.","All these metrics are indicative of the solid value proposition we continue to offer Medicare beneficiaries in the face of rate reductions. Successfully engaging our members in clinical programs is proving we can assist our members with their health needs. This is allowing us to offer stability in their premiums and benefits and reduce the complexity of navigating the healthcare system and helps produce the robust organic growth we are sharing with you today.","Looking at our other offerings, Humana stand-alone PDP membership continues to experience strong growth with the bulk of the growth in a low priced Walmart offering. This, together with growth in our Medicare Advantage membership, drives higher use of the services in our Healthcare Services segment benefiting the enterprise overall.","Turning to our HumanaOne membership. As we evaluate recent healthcare exchange enrollment data, we believe that comports well with the pricing assumptions we made for 2015. As we\u2019ve indicated on prior calls, our 2015 pricing appropriately assume the ultimate elimination of two of the three R\u2019s. We continue to be pleased with the mix of our membership both the across the medal tiers and by age distribution. We also believe that the 55 to 64 age ranges are opportunity to develop relationship with these members before they age into Medicare Advantage.","I also would want to highlight for you today something innovative we are doing in the Employer Group business. In the latter part of 2013, we introduced to our employer customers a product we call Total Health, which turns any standard medical plan of the employers choosing into an integrated health and wellbeing solution that encourages participation in Humana vitality, health coaching and clinical programs. Employee participation results in employer discounts, which is resulting in the shift of our single-year contract to a multi-year relationship that is creating employer solutions to not only cost but also productivity.","Employer receptivity to the Total Health product is high with membership now at approximately 100,000 versus less than 400,000 at the end of 2013. We anticipate in the future these wellness programs and services will be complementary to employers choosing private and public exchange models.","In conclusion, we continue to be pleased with our prospects for 2015 and beyond. The engagement of our associates and focus on the consumer through our integrated care delivery model has never been stronger. We believe that will result in the continuation of our superior clinical operating performance and a sustainable competitive advantage for quite some time to come.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brian for a more detail discussion of our financials and our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.","Brian Kane","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. As Bruce said in his remarks, 2014 was an unusually dynamic year full of opportunities and challenges. The growth in our Medicare business was substantial and was supplemented by the power of our Healthcare Services segment, which has prospered, while making a truly positive difference in our members' lives. Our Employer Group business capitalized on the late 2013 rollout of an exciting new offering in the form of Total Health while also ending the year on a high note in terms of financial performance.","All this transpired while we invested heavily in new growth opportunities both HumanaOne and our state-based businesses, which we believe will generate significant returns for our shareholders down the road. We are pleased that our full year adjusted EPS came in just above the midpoint of our guidance at $7.51 per share.","As we closed out the year, there were a few items that adversely affected our 2014 results, but we do not see any of these significantly impacting our 2015 guidance. Our Retail segment pretax earnings finished the year below our guidance range. This was primarily attributable to the severity of the flu season, slightly higher investment spending for our duals and state-based contracts and deterioration in the results for our Puerto Rico Medicare business, which continues to be a difficult market for us.","With regard to the flu, hospital inpatient admissions peaked in late December, early January but have since abated and have returned to more normalized levels. I should hasten to add that utilization more broadly remains benign and within expectations.","With regard to the duals, we continue to build out our infrastructure and are well positioned heading into 2015 to significantly reduce our investments which we have committed to do.","Turning to the Employer Group segment, our 2014 earnings results ended meaningfully above the upper end of our guidance range. While the flu did have some adverse impact on the Employer Group results, these were more than offset by lower medical claims utilization that we saw in both our commercial and group Medicare businesses. It is also important to note the effort that our Employer Group team has made to reduce administrative cost which was also a significant driver of the segments full year results.","Finally, our effective tax rate came in above the range of our previous guidance. There were several factors driving this, including the associated tax ramifications of higher losses in our Puerto Rico Medicare operations which are non-deductible for U.S. income tax purposes as well as lower tax exempt investment income. We\u2019ve evaluated each of these factors closely and have confidence that the 2015 guidance points we shared with you this morning encompass any continuing impact of each of these items.","Turning now to 2015, the majority of the guidance points we shared with your last quarter are unchanged. This slide summarizes the more significant changes since our last earnings call.","As we disclosed in a Form 8-K filing last month, we revised our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP enrollment guidance to reflect the results of the 2015 AEP. Our higher projection for Medicare Advantage enrollment resulted in an increase to our revenue guidance that more than offset the revenue impact of the lower expectations for stand-alone PDP membership.","As we have discussed in the past, the higher membership in our MA plans from the annual enrollment process will have a nominal impact on our retail insurance segment performance this year. While there will be a favorable impact on the healthcare services segments home-based business from the higher Medicare Advantage membership, this will be offset by the impact of the revised stand-alone PDP membership will have on Humana Pharmacy, as PDP members in our low-price point offering tend to use our wholly owned mail order and specialty pharmacies at rates slightly higher than our MA members.","One other element of our 2015 guidance points that we updated today is our projected accruals for the premium stabilization programs, commonly called the 3Rs. As Bruce shared in his remarks, we now have more color around the mix of our membership distribution among the medal tiers and by age range. Having evaluated that data, we are comfortable lowering our projection for full-year accrual for the 3Rs by approximately $50 million at the midpoint.","We now expect the net receivables for 2015 to be less than half of the level they were compared to the balances we accrued at the end of 2014. As we\u2019ve noted in prior calls, our pricing strategy for 2015 included significantly lowering reliance on the 3Rs and we\u2019re still on track for 2015 to achieve at a minimum breakeven results.","With the regard to the risk corridors, we believe that the 2014 $51 million net receivable that we disclosed this morning is indeed collectible, based on statutory and administrative actions. Further, any 2014 amounts must first be satisfied before subsequent years are paid. Finally, for 2015, the risk corridor receivable that we are currently forecasting is insignificant.","Turning to our operating cash flows. We have been around 1.5 times net income for some time now. And we anticipate maintaining that quality of earnings metric again in 2015. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating cash flows by approximately $200 million driven primarily by the timing of certain working capital items.","While our days claims payable declined sequentially by 2.8 days to 44.7, this was primarily due to the increase in capitation payments as we continue to grow the number of providers under risk-based contracts as well as the growth in our long-term support services business, whose providers get paid monthly.","Additionally, our normal December decline in claims inventories driven by the holiday season and higher staffing associated with preparing for new members coming on January 1st was magnified by the relatively late HumanaOne enrollment and the associated pended claims which we paid down in the fourth quarter.","I\u2019ll now turn to our view of the quarterly breakdown of earnings for 2015. Though we do not provide specific quarterly guidance, we did want to give you a sense for the key drivers of performance among the quarters as we\u2019ve done in prior years.","Given our expectations that our healthcare exchange business will at least break even and our investments in state-based contracts will begin to mitigate, we\u2019ve layered in the impact of those newer businesses across the quarters. The result is that we again project the third and fourth quarters to experience the most pressure in light of the quarterly progression of health benefit ratios and the timing of marketing and open enrollment across our lines of business.","I\u2019ll conclude my discussion this morning with a few words around capital allocation. As Bruce said in his remarks, discipline, capital allocation is a key component of Humana\u2019s investment thesis. At the time of our third quarter release, we announced the significant increase in our share repurchase authorization and a commitment to accelerate our buyback activity.","We\u2019ve held through to that commitment and maintained our expectation to buyback $1 billion in stock by June of this year with approximately $630 million of that already completed. We would also expect to continue share repurchases in the back half of the year.","Aside from share repurchase activity, we are continuing to evaluate all of our businesses to ensure that they fit strategically within our portfolio and our earning their cost of capital or have a convincing plan to do so. To the extent, a business does not need these criteria. That business will be restructured or divested. We expect to continue to update you on the progress of this review over the coming months.","With that, we\u2019ll open the lines up for your question. In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, please introduce the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JP Morgan.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Question around the retail results, you laid out a few headwinds to the quarter. Can you put some numbers around them and also give us some color on your positioning in Puerto Rico Medicare and how much money you are losing there right now?","Bruce Broussard","Sure. So the flu is a major driver. It was around $45 million all-in for the company. About three quarters of that was driven in the Retail segment. With regard to Puerto Rico, I\u2019d rather not go into the details of the numbers there but we are losing money in that market. We lost more this quarter than we expected. And really that\u2019s driven by the fact that the dynamics in that market are different. The medical management of those members is different.","We got hit by uncompensated care adjustments that we had to take into our results that weren\u2019t in the bids because they came after the bids. And so 2014 was a very difficult year for that market. On the dual side, we are continuing to build up that infrastructure. As we think about investments for 2014, I\u2019d say the duals came in slightly higher, individual came in slightly lower. So that\u2019s sort of how I\u2019d calibrate those results on the retail segment.","Justin Lake","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on, I guess that last comment before the Q&A about evaluating certain businesses, making sure that they are appropriately returned. I don\u2019t really remember you guys talking a lot about this before. Is there -- are there significant business lines that are currently being evaluated? And I think you mentioned either divesting them or fixing them. Is there anything in the guidance that would contemplate some potential cost of fixing a business line that is not ready to return that you are targeting?","Bruce Broussard","Well, our guidance really incorporates all of our current businesses as they stand today. We are very focused on continuing to drive down admin costs and as you saw that in the Employer Group segment this year, we\u2019ll continue to work on that. But we are evaluating all the lines of business. I think we\u2019ve been very clear that all of our businesses over time needs to earn their cost of capital and we are going to make sure that occurs and we are being very disciplined about it. And so, I don\u2019t want to comment on any specific businesses but we are evaluating our entire portfolio.","Kevin Fischbeck","So, I guess, is there a way to frame it? Are we talking about things around the edges, or are there decent-sized parts of the business that are being evaluated?","Bruce Broussard","Again, I will say, all of our businesses are being evaluated. I think we feel very good about our core businesses. So, I wouldn\u2019t see any major change in that regard. But there are number of businesses that need to hit their returns and we are focused on that.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Josh Raskin","Hi. Thanks. The question is around the Medicare Advantage growth and the sources, the drivers. I think I heard you say 52% had come from competitors. I guess I was little surprised to hear that. I know last year was a little bit of an anomaly. But I\u2019m just curios where that has trended in the past. And then as you think about the overall MA growth, how much of that is coming from previously fee-for-service Medicare lives, how many are agents, how many are PDP conversions and maybe any other buckets over all of that MA growth?","Jim Murray","This is Jim Murray. As we look across the various markets that we grew and there were probably 10 or 12 markets that we would point to. We are seeing the beneficial impact of our higher stars rating. We believe having a favorable impact in the way that we were able to position ourselves relative to the competition. Bruce earlier talked about North Carolina and that\u2019s a market where we have 4.5 stars. And some of the competitors there were there before didn\u2019t have as higher stars score. We think that that in terms of the premium and benefits that we are able to put on the street helps to position us better.","So, I would say that that\u2019s one aspect that we are seeing play itself out well. We are obviously very pleased about that. As respects, the numbers that we get from competitors versus fee-for-service, I would tell you that that number, as we looked at is about 50-50. Agent generally, the significant part of the agent growth occurs during the ROI as opposed to during the AEP itself. A lot of favorable dynamics and again, as Bryan and Bruce both pointed out, we are pretty pleased with the way that this AEP played out for us.","Josh Raskin","I got you.","Bruce Broussard","One thing I would add to that is, as we\u2019ve discussed, we had great growth in our HMO area and our strategy has always been is create a relationship through the PPO product and then evolve them over. And we just see that strategy continue to be strong, which both helps us on retention but also on the engagement and helping them with their health.","Josh Raskin","And just a follow-up on that. So, one, are you seeing any material impact from PDP conversions in the AEP? And then I guess I am just looking at that sort of competitor impact. Are you seeing -- is that different than what you have seen in previous years? Is the impact of stars more important now or you doing better vis-\u00e0-vis the competition in a different way than you\u2019ve seen in previous years?","Bruce Broussard","I think last year, we had the same circumstance. We sound like a broken record, but our clinical platform has allowed us to offer stable benefits in the marketplace. And that clinical platform is not only helping us with stars score but it\u2019s also helping engage individuals and getting them in the right clinical programs, which is ultimately lowering the cost of medical side, which is then turning around and allowing us to offer the proper benefits. I think it all sort of fits together. It\u2019s just now stars. I would say that that\u2019s a contributor in the individual marketplaces, but I wouldn\u2019t walk away from the call and say that\u2019s our competitor advantage or competitive advantage. It\u2019s really the clinical program that drives the lower medical cost and better quality.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice","Hello everybody. I might just ask you about two items that were in your walk forward to guidance last quarter. I think you had in there about a $0.35 tailwind from lower investments in exchange and state-based contracts. And Brian, you mentioned that a little bit into your prepared remarks. I wondered if there is an update on what you are thinking in terms of investments and the timing. And the other when I was going to ask you about was Hep C. You had a $0.45 tailwind in your guidance there. And since then, I know you've done your preferred vendor contracts with Gilead, and I wondered did that $0.45 contemplate that contract, or is there now potential upside?","Bruce Broussard","So with regard to the first question on the investments, I would say it\u2019s similar to what we discussed last call in terms of what we are expecting. Again, H1, we expect to breakeven. Hopefully, do better than that on the Medicaid dual side. We are expecting to reduce our investments pretty significantly. I would think about it sort of a $0.25 investment plus or minus on the Medicaid dual side for 2015.","For Hep C, it really is -- it\u2019s early to tell. Let\u2019s see what happens for 2015. Clearly, the unit price discount helps but we still need to see where utilization ultimately plays out. We\u2019re watching that very closely and we\u2019ll see over the next few months where we stand. I would say as it looks today, we feel pretty good but it\u2019s still early.","A.J. Rice","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Just interested if you can give your thoughts on the CMS value-based contracting initiative for fee-for-service and whether we would view that as more of a positive or a risk for MA. And just thinking about from a reimbursement perspective if you think there is any risk that MA rates could be pressured in the intermediate to long-term if CMS does assume lower unit cost and lower cost trends in fee-for-service and whether that could translate into the per capita growth rate assumption that they make for the MA business.","Bruce Broussard","So, I think overall, our view is this transition to value-based reimbursement and getting more providers in those reimbursement models is the best for, I think the industry as a whole. And we look at that as an opportunity for us, both in helping providers. At the same time, continuing to enhance the Medicare Advantage positioning. In regards to, does it affect the benchmark, I think is what you are getting to. Over time, it will affect the benchmark, I think in any kind of plan that\u2019s there. It\u2019s lowering the cost on Medicare if you affect it.","But I do think, long-term, the Medicare Advantage offers a significantly better advantage as you look at the comprehensive nature of it. It\u2019s just not about the price. Also what we found is about the integration of the services and the assistance that is provided there. But at the same time, we realize that we have to do better than the competition in our clinical programs and that competition is both within Medicare Advantage and also Medicaid as a whole.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Schenker","So, I appreciate Brian's comments in the prepared remarks on DCPs. But they have been trending down for some time, so maybe if you could just give me a little bit more understanding about the moving parts behind the trend over that time, including maybe specifically how changing mix has impacted that number? So you have mentioned the long-term support services, but how do growing exchange and MA growth impact that and how should we really be thinking about that metric going forward?","Brian Kane","The major driver really is the capitation. As we continue to increase our physicians under capitation arrangements, basically you have a benefit expense, you don\u2019t have a reserve. And so that really is the major driver. If you look at the roll forwards, you can see the days move really driven by that. The LTSS business has a similar dynamic in the sense that we pay the nursing homes on a monthly basis and so again, we have this expense without having that reserve and so that will naturally take it down.","And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, we had an outlier in the sense of H1 and that the members came on a little bit late. There were a bunch of pended claims that we were working through and we really did that over the fourth quarter. And so that really I think -- I\u2019ll put those as the three major buckets what\u2019s driving today\u2019s claims. I would also add that our cash flows are still very strong. And so as we think about our quality of earnings metrics, we\u2019re very focused to make sure our cash flows are good and they are.","Andy Schenker","So therefore, just to follow up going forward because you are expecting more growth in capitation. You would expect that number to keep going down. And does the growth in exchanges or MA somewhat offset that to the other side, or..?","Brian Kane","I would say, all else being equal, I think that\u2019s right.","Andy Schenker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe","Back to the Puerto Rico book, can you give us a sense of size and\/or magnitude of the loss? And then I knew you exited Medicaid there. Can you maybe talk about your commitment to that region within Medicare and\/or how you are going to be able to sort of fix the issues? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Again, I\u2019d rather not go into specifics on our P&L in that market. I would say, there are real losses, they move the needle, they affected our tax rate. We are working hard to fix the problems in the market. The Medicaid -- losing the Medicaid contract, I think is indicative of where we are and deciding not to re-up there. And so our guys are working hard on that on fixing the problems and getting our members to engage and improve the medical management and a like.","Again, we had some one-time issue in 2014 is related to uncompensated care and the time when that came into effect with respect to the bids. But as I said, all of our businesses that aren\u2019t earning their cost of capital need to be evaluated and we\u2019re certainly doing that.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And maybe, I know you don't want to talk about the size of the losses. Can you give us a sense of even just the premium?","Jim Murray","There are about -- this is Jim. There are about 50,000 Medicare Advantage members in Puerto Rico as we ended the year. We purposely try to downsize as respect to our activities relative to the AEP, so that we can shrink that membership.","The premium that we get from the Federal Government for Medicare is solid. As Brian alluded to you earlier, the government made some change in the way that they pay hospitals after our bids were finalize for 2014. That was a big drag on our results.","And the other thing that Brian mentioned, the loss of focus, because we did loose the Medicaid contract and the clinical model that was commensurate with that negatively impacted our Medicare results.","So we expect this smaller portfolio of business in 2015 and as Brian said, we\u2019re actively working on things that would improve that our prospects in Puerto Rico and that\u2019s probably, where we should end it.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa","We are getting close to that time of year when we hear about what the 2016 Medicare Advantage rates are going to be? We know from December that 2.45% was sort of what they were talking about for the growth rate at that point? But what other factors should we be considering that might be impacting the payments that you get from the government for Medicare rates in 2016?","Bruce Broussard","Yeah. Peter, this is pure speculation, so it\u2019s always difficulty. I think we will look at the discussions that have historically been in the rate notice around in-home assessments as being an area of discussion and I also think the MRA adjustments are another area that possibly could be included in the rate notice.","But that\u2019s really based on the dialog that has happened over the past few years with them and I don\u2019t have any insight information more than anybody else has on what\u2019s going to come out.","Peter Costa","And in terms of the range of possibilities, how do you think it will impact your ability to price business for next year, attain growth for next year?","Jim Murray","This is Jim. We have always -- over the last number of years expected the worst and as we focus on what our necessary actions relative to trend benders, we plan for that and we\u2019d see what happens in April and then we evaluate our bid processes and strategies accordingly.","But we are in the process as we speak of trying to identify trend bending activities that would address the worst case scenario in some of the things that Bruce talked about. And we are putting those in place for 2016 as we speak.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch","Hi. Good morning. Question on your guidance in the Medicaid duals, so I think as I understood, you are looking at a $0.25 approximate tailwind on that business from reduced investment? But am I correct that that business is still losing money, if you will, when you count in the investment or expect to for 2015 or is that wrong and can you quantify any magnitude?","Bruce Broussard","Yeah. If I wasn\u2019t cleat, I think, we expect around $0.25 of loss in 2015 for the state base businesses.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Okay.","Bruce Broussard","And that is reduced from 2014, pretty meaningfully.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. And can you give us a range of magnitude on 2014?","Bruce Broussard","No. I would say, if you combine H1 and the duals it was caught around $0.70 plus or minus.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Bruce Broussard","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James","Yeah. And Humana and other insurers have been working on providing new data to CMS that follows up on actions and results from home health risk assessments? And I'm wondering if there has been any consensus reached among the insurers or with CMS on how to effectively evaluate the results of that or the deficiency of follow-up actions?","Bruce Broussard","No there -- there has been discussion on the effectiveness of in-home assessments and the work that\u2019s been done there on a number of different occasions. I don\u2019t think there has been one proposal that has been agreed upon by the industry and by CMS. And I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t want to get into commenting on what we think CMS would come out with based on our discussions about industry wide and company specific.","Regina Nethery","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Tom Carroll","Hey good morning. Just a question on the 3Rs, how do you want investors to think about the change in the 3R accruals that you are making for 2015. I mean, is this just you have more color as you put it which provides more visibility on operation or is Humana perhaps getting a little more aggressive on assumptions? I wonder if you could balance that out for us?","Bruce Broussard","Well, I guess, I\u2019d say we viewed it\u2019s a good thing that we are able to reduce the reliance on the 3Rs by over half. That\u2019s a delivered strategy we made by ticking up pricing. We\u2019re being very disciplined there. And that\u2019s really part of our strategy to get to breakeven or better for 2015. So I think when we saw the new sales come in and break down by medal tear and age and geography et cetera, we are able to take it down slightly from where we were on the third quarter but we view that as a good thing. And again feel positive about where we are with that business and how we priced it.","Jim Murray","When we entered the exchanges in 2014, I think we communicated to the investors that we were going to grow in 2014, while in 2015 transition to insure that there were sustainability in that business long-term. And what you see happening is that -- that\u2019s what\u2019s happening that we grew in 2014, we would define success this year as maintaining our membership that we had in 2014 and 2015 and -- and having maintaining that level while at the same time reducing our reliance on the 3Rs, specifically 2Rs to allow us to make that transition, when the 2Rs go away next year.","Tom Carroll","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold","Could you speak to your expectations for medical trends? You got a better economy, consumer confidence seems to be rising, fuel prices -- fuel prices are down kind of like increasing discretionary income for folks. How do you think that might impact medical cost? And how do you build that into your Medicare Advantage assumptions with respect to trend benders that you are going to need and the medical trend expected in \u201815 versus \u201814 for MA? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Sure. Well, as you know, we did increase the expected trend for our commercial group business to 5.5% to 6.5% from 4.5%. So that was a significant increase, I think, reflecting all the things that you just discussed. On the Medicare side, it\u2019s not as directly tied to economic growth. There was probably some impact.","We focus pretty intently on where the trend benders need to be relative to whether the rates come in at from a CMS perspective. And I would say there is probably less marginal move unlike the commercial side based on economic growth and other factors, employment, et cetera that you would typically see.","Christine Arnold","What about the fact that fuel prices are lower? Old people are spending less to fuel up their vehicles. And also, can you tell us what kind of trend bender you assumed in 2015 versus 2014?","Bruce Broussard","No. We are not going to get to that level of detail. We haven\u2019t really evaluated it. I don\u2019t know the answer of this specific, how fuel impacted but we take the holistic view where trend maybe and number of factors go into that.","Jim Murray","I\u2019m actually happy that the seniors have fuel for their cars because then they can go and see their doctors and take care of all the things that they need to take care of rather than waiting for an acute event. So I\u2019m happy about that.","Christine Arnold","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partner.","Ana Gupte","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I was just trying to see some of the less focused areas of business, if they might be potential drivers for upside. So one of them is individual off-exchange, and I know that's a much smaller piece of your book. But two of your peers have stated that they lost money in '14 and taking some pretty serious pricing actions on removing ACA-compliant plans. Is there anything here that you might have been doing? And I get it that the MLR floors probably took care of a piece of this, but just '14 with guaranteed issue and community rating did hurt some of the off-exchange books.","Brian Kane","Yeah. So as we said, I don\u2019t really want to distinguish between off-exchange and on-exchange in terms of our pricing. As we said, we\u2019ve been very disciplined on pricing with our entire ACA-compliant book. Off-exchange is part of our strategy. It\u2019s an important part of our strategy. And we\u2019re looking to mitigate the losses in both the off-exchange and on-exchange. And again all-in, as we said, we do expect to do that this year.","Ana Gupte","And then secondly -- thanks for that, Brian. Secondly on the small group, and maybe just the broader commercial fully insured book, your employer loss ratio looks pretty good for this quarter. In the third quarter, it\u2019s deteriorated if I remember right. And somehow I didn't have a chance to follow up on that. Our pricing surveys show you jacked up your pricing quite a bit for '15. So any improvement in margin there and what are you baking into your guidance?","Brian Kane","Well, again, as we -- back in the third quarter we did suffer the impact of some of the transitional relief that we discussed. We got some of that back in the fourth quarter through, I would say both current period and prior period development that were better than expectations. And that really was the driver of the outperformance along with the continued focus on admin cost.","I would say as we move into the next year, the price for Hep C and the like, hopefully we\u2019ll continue to see improvements there. And really where we need to focus is on the admin side as well.","Bruce Broussard","Yes. There is one other dynamic in this small group space that you are all aware of, I\u2019m sure is that there is a movement into the community base trading methodology and that\u2019s kind of an interesting dynamic that we\u2019re watching play out with some of our competition and where they price their community rated business rates versus where we\u2019re at.","As we sit here right now, we feel pretty good about how we\u2019re positioned and are monitoring not only the community rights but the migration from our existing block of business into those with the transitional relief opportunity that we have. So again feel pretty good about that and I am glad that you noticed that in some of the stuff that we provided.","Regina Nethery","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Rigg","Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the flu comments from earlier. I know you talked about $45 million headwind in the quarter. I guess, I am just trying to get a sense for -- just want to confirm and that was relative to budget, and just for how much the flu costs increase on a year-to-year basis? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","That was relative to our forecast for the fourth quarter. We had a very difficult December with regard to flu. As I said, it\u2019s abated towards the end of the month and early January, and so we feel good about where we are for 2015. The 2014 results were worst than the 2013 results, but I don\u2019t want to go into specifics there, but they were certainly worst particularly in December.","Chris Rigg","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.","Dave Windley","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. On some maybe difficult to answer questions, but curious of your broader thoughts, first of all, on the Supreme Court decision and how you are contingency planning around that? And secondly, your thoughts on President Obama's budget and proposed cuts to Medicare and specifically Medicare Advantage? Thanks.","Bruce Broussard","Yeah. We really don\u2019t get into the habit of commenting on those broad aspects until they\u2019re finalized. I don\u2019t want to get into that, because it\u2019s just speculation and I will leave it at that.","Bruce Broussard","I think that was the last question. So with that being said, we really appreciate the support by our investors and the confidence in the company. And most importantly, we thank our 55,000 associates for their dedication and helping our members with their health and all the necessary actions that are required with that.
